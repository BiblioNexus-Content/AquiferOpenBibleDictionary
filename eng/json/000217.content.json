    "content": "<h1>AIJALON</h1><ol><li><p>A city located in a valley 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem (modern-day Yalo).</p><p>It was originally given to the tribe of Dan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:42\">Joshua 19:42</a>). Aijalon was made as one of four cities in Dan for Levites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:24\">Joshua 21:24</a>). Later, it became a city of refuge in the tribe of Ephraim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:69\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:69</a>). Dan had moved north, being unable to maintain its original territory, including Aijalon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:36\">Judges 1:34</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:36\">36</a>). Near Aijalon, Saul and Jonathan won a battle against the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:31\">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:31</a>). People from Benjamin&apos;s tribe also lived there at one point (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:13\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:13</a>).</p><p>After Solomon’s death, Israel split into two kingdoms. King Rehoboam strengthened Aijalon, as it was on the border of the two kingdoms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:10\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:10</a>). The Egyptian pharaoh Shishak claimed he conquered Aijalon around 924 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:2-2Chr12:12\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:2</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:2-2Chr12:12\">12</a>). Much later, the Philistines took Aijalon during the reign of Ahaz (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:18</a>).</p><p>The valley of Aijalon is famous for a battle where Joshua fought to control Gibeon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:12\">Joshua 10:12</a>). During this battle, Joshua prayed to God: “<span>O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:12\">Joshua 10:12</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3738\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of Refuge</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5900\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Levitical Cities</span>.</p></li><li><p>A city in the territory of Zebulun. The burial place of the judge Elon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:12\">Judges 12:12</a>).</p></li></ol>",
