    "content": "<h1>ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND</h1><p>After Israel conquered Canaan, the land was divided between the twelve tribes. However, the land was not divided according to what they won in battle. Instead, they fought together and divided the conquered land by casting lots (a way of making a random choice). </p><p>This method was similar to tossing a coin (to see which side would land facing up) or drawing sticks (where individuals pick from a set of concealed sticks, one of which is shorter or marked). </p><p>Lots were cast at other times in the Bible to determine God&apos;s will. By using lots, the tribes avoided arguments. It also showed that the land belonged to God, and he could give it to whoever he wanted (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov16:33\">Proverbs 16:33</a>). The Lord gives orders to divide the land by lots in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:52-Num26:56\">Numbers 26:52</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:52-Num26:56\">56</a> (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:1-Num34:29\">Numbers 34</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:1-Josh19:22\">Joshua 13</a>–<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:1-Josh19:22\">19 </a>describes how the land was divided at Shiloh.</p><p>The southern part of the Transjordan (the land east of the Jordan River) was given to two and a half tribes by Moses in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:42\">Numbers 32</a>. West of the Jordan, the remaining nine and a half tribes received plots of land by lot. However, this only happened after their faithful leader, Caleb, got his choice of the region around Hebron. The tribes were given their land in order of their relative locations.</p><ol><li><p>Judah received territory in the South, including Caleb’s lands, and extended north to Jerusalem. </p></li><li><p>Ephraim and Manasseh, the patriarch Joseph&apos;s sons, received large central portions of the land. </p></li><li><p>Benjamin received the land between Judah and Ephraim. </p></li><li><p>Simeon received land in southern Judah. </p></li><li><p>Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan received the land north of Manasseh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:1-Josh19:51\">Joshua 19</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Originally, Dan received the land west of Judah. However, the Philistines lived in the land on the coastline. So, Dan migrated north and renamed the captured city of Lachish after their tribal ancestor, Dan (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:1-Judg18:31\">Judges 18</a>). From then on, the phrase “from Dan to Beersheba” meant all of Israel.</p><p>Assigning land by casting lots may seem strange, but to the customs of that time, it made theological sense. Rulers in the ancient Near East were believed to be representatives of their gods. They owned the lands and gave portions to whomever they wanted. After the exodus, Israel was a theocracy (God was their king). No human had power over God. So, no human owned the land. Therefore, God was the only one who could give them their land.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3803\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Conquest and Allotment of the Land</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5626\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Joshua, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3720\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Chronology of the Bible (Old Testament)</span>.</p>",
