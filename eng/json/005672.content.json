    "content": "<h1>TRIBE OF LEVI</h1><h2>The Beginning of the Tribe of Levi</h2><p>The Levites were one of the tribes of Israel. The Levites are named after Levi, the third son of Leah and Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:34\">Genesis 29:34</a>). The name Levi means &quot;attached,&quot; reflecting Leah&apos;s hope that bearing three sons would cause Jacob to be more attached to her as his wife. This idea of attachment also appears in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:2\">Numbers 18:2</a>, where the tribe of Levi is described as being &quot;attached&quot; to Aaron.</p><p>Levi is first mentioned in connection with the violent event at Shechem, where Levi and Simeon slaughtered the inhabitants of the city in revenge for the rape of their sister, Dinah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen34:25-Gen34:29\">Genesis 34:25–29</a>). This act brought a rebuke from their father Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen34:30\">Genesis 34:30</a>), who also cursed them on his deathbed, predicting that their descendants would be scattered throughout Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7\">49:5–7</a>). Despite this curse, the tribe of Levi would later become God&apos;s chosen priestly tribe, while Simeon eventually merged into the tribe of Judah.</p><h2>The Special Role of the Levites</h2><p>At first, Levi was a &quot;secular&quot; tribe like the others, without any special religious role (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:1\">Exodus 2:1</a>). However, this changed when the Levites demonstrated their loyalty to God during Israel&apos;s rebellion with the golden calf incident (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:25-Exod32:29\">Exodus 32:25–29</a>). As a reward for their faithfulness, God established a &quot;covenant with Levi&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:19\">Numbers 18:19</a>), setting them apart for priestly duties (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num3:11-Num3:13\">Numbers 3:11–13</a>). From that point on, the Levites were to serve as priests and religious leaders for Israel. In return for their service, the tribe of Levi did not receive a specific territory like the other tribes; instead, God was to be their inheritance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:20\">Numbers 18:20</a>). However, they were given 48 cities, including six cities of refuge, scattered throughout Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:42\">Joshua 21:1–42</a>).</p><p>Since Levi could build their own wealth or land, the tribe was to be supported by gifts and tithes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:21\">Numbers 18:21</a>), like the widow, orphan, and stranger. Their livelihood was the responsibility of God’s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut14:29\">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>). Since they were God’s tribe, Joab did not want to include Levi in David’s census (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr21:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 21:6</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:49\">Numbers 1:49</a>). Levi did not serve in war except in a religious way (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:21\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:21</a>). They were responsible for the meeting tent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:50-Num1:53\">Numbers 1:50–53</a>) and later the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr23:25-1Chr23:32\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 23:25–32</a>).</p><h2>Duties and Responsibilities</h2><p>Within Levi, the Bible makes a clear distinction between: </p><ul><li><p>The high priest,</p></li><li><p>The rest of the priests, and</p></li><li><p>Some lesser Levites who had minor tasks. </p></li></ul><p>In the early days, they packed and moved the tent of meeting (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:50-Num1:51\">Numbers 1:50–51</a>), and did other duties. Later, they served as doormen and musicians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:42\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 16:42</a>). The duties of Levi are listed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:8-Deut33:11\">Deuteronomy 33:8–11. </a>There, religious help and advice are just as important as their priestly duties. So, it is not surprising that Jehoshaphat used them to teach the law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7-2Chr17:9\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 17:7–9</a>). But, they were normally seen as simply priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:13\">Judges 17:13</a>).</p><p>The Levites&apos; role as religious leaders and teachers was significant throughout Israel&apos;s history, and references to the lasting covenant with Levi can be found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer33:20-Jer33:26\">Jeremiah 33:20–26</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:3-Mal3:4\">Malachi 3:3–4</a>. After the Babylonian exile, members of the tribe of Levi returned to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36-Ezra2:42\">Ezra 2:36–42</a>), with a higher proportion from the priestly families.</p><h2>Levites in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, Barnabas, a prominent early Christian, is identified as a Levite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:36\">Acts 4:36</a>). Even today, the surname Levy among Jews often indicates descent from the tribe of Levi.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>.</p>",
