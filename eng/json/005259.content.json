    "content": "<h1>SINLESSNESS OF CHRIST</h1><p>The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ never sinned. He is perfect in every way as God&apos;s Son. His human nature was completely holy His human nature is holy, without any sin. </p><h2>What Does the Bible Teach About the Sinlessness of Christ?</h2><p>The Bible clearly states that Jesus was without sin. Paul states that Christ “knew no sin” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:21</a>). Peter says “<span>He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:22\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:22</a>). He calls him “righteous” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18\">3:18</a>). </p><p>The writer to the Hebrews says that Christ is “<span>holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:26\">Hebrews 7:26</a>). James speaks of him as “the righteous” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:6\">James 5:6</a>). John says that “in Him there is no sin” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:5\">1&nbsp;John 3:5</a>). In the Gospels and in the preaching of the apostles, Jesus is repeatedly witnessed to as the Holy Son of God, the Holy One of God, the Holy and Righteous One (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:35\">Luke 1:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:69\">John 6:69</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:14\">Acts 3:14</a>).</p><p>Jesus himself asked his opponents, “Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin?” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:46\">John 8:46</a>). Throughout his life, Jesus lived with the full knowledge that he was holy and without sin. Many references and inferences are made stating that he is without sin. He kept the entire law in every detail and in each respect (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom10:4\">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:15\">Hebrews 4:15</a>). Pilate’s wife regarded Jesus as a righteous man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:19,Matt27:24\">Matthew 27:19)</a>. Pilate himself spoke of him as an innocent man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:19,Matt27:24\">Matthew 27:24</a>). Even Judas realized that he himself had sinned by “betraying innocent blood” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:4\">Matthew 27:4</a>).</p><h2>What Does It Mean for Christ to Be Sinless?</h2><p>Christ&apos;s sinlessness means more than just the fact that he never sinned. There is also an important question about whether Jesus could have sinned at all. Was it possible for Jesus to sin? This question is known as the impeccability of Christ, which means Christ was unable to sin. The opposite view is peccability. This teaching says that Jesus could have sinned, even though he chose not to. Both views raise important questions:</p><ul><li><p>If Jesus could not sin, how could he truly be tempted? The Bible tells us about many times when Jesus faced temptation.</p></li><li><p>If Jesus could have sinned (even though he did not), would this mean God could sin? This is a problem because Jesus is fully God&apos;s Son.</p></li></ul><p>Some people say Jesus could have sinned as a human but not as God. This is wrong because Jesus&apos;s human and divine natures cannot be separated. Jesus cannot act as only human or only God. He is always both at the same time. This was part of the error of the ancient Nestorian heretics. Everything Jesus does, he does as both fully God and fully human.</p><p>Being tempted and being unable to sin can both be true at the same time. This is hard for us to understand because we are sinners and know what it is like to do wrong. Jesus&apos;s experience was unique. His temptations in the wilderness and throughout his life were real, even though it was impossible for him to actually sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:28,Luke22:39-Luke22:46\">Luke 22:28, 39–46</a>).</p><p>Here is an example to help explain this: Think of a fortress that cannot be captured as long as its defenses stay strong. Even though the fortress cannot be defeated, enemies can still attack it fiercely. In a similar way, Jesus faced real temptations but could not be defeated by them because he is God&apos;s Holy Son.&quot;</p><p>His temptations were real. Therefore, “we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:15-Heb4:16\">Hebrews 4:15–16</a>).</p>",
