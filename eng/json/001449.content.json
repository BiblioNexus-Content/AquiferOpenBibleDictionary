    "content": "<h1>CROWN</h1><p>Headpiece symbolizing honor or high office. In addition to using the word metaphorically, the Old Testament refers to three kinds of crowns. </p><p>One type of crown was worn by the high priest and Hebrew kings. The high priest’s “holy crown” was a gold plate engraved with the words “Holy to the Lord” and fastened to the front of a turban (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod29:6\">Exodus 29:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod39:30\">39:30</a>). [A turban is a type of headwear (usually made of cloth) that wraps around the head.] The high priest&apos;s &quot;holy crown&quot; symbolized his consecration as the people’s representative before God. The Hebrew kings wore a crown light enough to be worn into battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:10\">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:10</a>)—perhaps a narrow band of silk studded with jewels. Like the high priest’s crown, the king’s crown also indicated a divinely appointed office (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:12\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:39\">Psalms 89:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps132:18\">132:18</a>). </p><p>A second type of crown was a massive gold and jeweled symbol of office worn by pagan kings and idols (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam12:30\">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth1:11\">Esther 1:11</a>). The prophet Zechariah placed such a crown on Joshua the high priest to indicate the union of royal and priestly functions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech6:11,Zech6:14\">Zechariah 6:11, 14</a>). </p><p>A third type of crown was a wreath of flowers used at a banquet to symbolize joy and celebration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song3:11\">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa28:1\">Isaiah 28:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Wis2:8\">Wisdom of Solomon 2:8</a>).</p><p>The word “crown” is used metaphorically to indicate rule or royalty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah3:17\">Nahum 3:17</a>, King James Version), glory or honor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:9\">Job 19:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:5\">Psalm 8:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek16:12\">Ezra 16:12</a>), joy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek23:42\">Ezra 23:42</a>), or pride (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:36\">Job 31:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa28:3\">Isaiah 28:3</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament the most common word for “crown” means a laurel wreath worn at banquets or a prize given as a civic or military honor. The apostle Paul alluded to its use as an athletic prize when he urged Christians to be disciplined in striving for a “crown” that would not wither (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor9:25\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:5\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:5</a>). Paul regarded his converts as his “joy and crown” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:1\">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess2:19\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:19</a>).</p><p>A victor’s wreath symbolizes the eternal life inherited by Christians who have persevered (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:12\">James 1:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:4\">1&nbsp;Peter 5:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:10\">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:11\">3:11</a>). In the book of Revelation, the victories of the locusts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev9:7\">9:7</a>), the woman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:1\">12:1</a>), and Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev6:2\">6:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:14\">14:14</a>) are symbolized by laurel crowns. A different Greek word, meaning a royal crown, is used for the diadems on the heads of the dragon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:3\">12:3</a>), the beast from the sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:1\">13:1</a>), and Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:12\">19:12</a>).</p><p>Jesus’s crown of thorns was a circular band formed from a prickly shrub—an ironic parody of a victor’s wreath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:17-Mark15:18\">Mark 15:17–18</a>). Its combination with the robe, scepter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:27-Matt27:29\">Matthew 27:27–29</a>), and satirical inscription on the cross that Jesus was “the King of the Jews” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:26\">Mark 15:26</a>), were all meant to mock him as a failed messiah.</p>",
