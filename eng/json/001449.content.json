This is called &quot;crucifixion.&quot; Crucifixion was a painful and shameful form of execution, typically used to kill the worst criminals, slaves, or rebels. Jesus was crucified on a cross even though he was innocent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:32-Matt27:56\">Matthew 27:32–56</a>).</p><p>Jesus told his followers they must “take up their cross” to follow him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:24\">Matthew 16:24</a>). This means being willing to face hardship and suffering for the sake of faith.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3868\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Crucifixion</span>.</p>",
