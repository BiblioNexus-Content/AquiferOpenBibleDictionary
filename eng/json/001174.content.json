The letter talked about friendship between Rome and Simon.</p><p>Caria was one of several Greek regions that received this letter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:23\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:23</a>). In the letter, Lucius said that anyone who ran away from Israel to these regions should be sent back to Simon. Simon would then punish them according to Jewish law (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:21\">21</a>).</p>",
