    "content": "<h1>HATRED</h1><p>Hatred is a strong feeling of dislike or enemy-like feelings towards someone or something. It can make a person:</p><ul><li><p>Strongly dislike someone or something</p></li><li><p>Want to get revenge for being wronged</p></li></ul><p>The Scriptures forbid people to hate others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:17-Lev19:18\">Leviticus 19:17–18</a>) because it leads to sin. Indeed, hatred itself is considered murder (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:15\">1&nbsp;John 3:15</a>). We are called upon to let God, the holy one, avenge all wrongs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov20:22\">Proverbs 20:22</a>), and we are commanded by Jesus to love our enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:44\">Matthew 5:43–44</a>).</p><p>Not all hatred is bad. The Bible tells us:</p><ul><li><p>God hates evil things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov6:16-Prov6:19\">Proverbs 6:16–19</a>)</p></li><li><p>God hates evil people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps5:5\">Psalm 5:5</a>)</p></li></ul><p>The Scripture also contains expressions such as “Yet Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:2-Mal1:3\">Malachi 1:2–3</a>). This means that God elected Jacob and not Esau to be the founder of the Jewish people. Similarly, Jesus challenged people to hate their lives and earthly relationships if they wanted to follow him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:26\">Luke 14:26</a>). This means that they must choose Jesus above all else.</p>",
