    "content": "<h1>GEMARA*</h1><p>Summary of the important points of rabbinic discussion on the Mishnah (the oral tradition). The Gemara and Mishnah together form the Talmud (which many Jews consider authoritative for their faith). In Aramaic, <em>Gemara</em> means “acquired learning.” That meaning reflects the teaching method of the rabbis, who passed on the Gemara by committing it to memory rather than writing it down. The word’s Hebrew root means “to complete.” Since the Gemara takes the form of a running commentary on the Mishnah, it serves to supplement and complete it.</p><p>Pages of the Talmud are arranged with the Mishnah in the middle and the Gemara in blocks of print on the side. The Gemara does not necessarily quote the same sources twice when dealing with similar passages from the Mishnah on the same problem, nor does it always contain commentary on the Mishnah. The Gemara also includes folklore, astronomy, astrology, medicine, homiletic parables, and examples from great rabbis’ lives.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6333\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mishnah</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7892\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Talmud</span>.</p>",
