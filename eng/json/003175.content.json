He and Jahzeiah opposed Ezra&apos;s idea that the sons of Israel divorce the foreign women they married after returning to Palestine from exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:15\">Ezra 10:15</a>).</p></li><li><p>A Levite who was the son of Joiada. He was the father of Jaddua and a descendant of Jeshua, the high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:11\">Nehemiah 12:11</a>). He might be the same person as Jehohanan (or Johanan), Eliashib’s grandson, mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:6\">Ezra 10:6</a> (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:23\">Nehemiah 12:23</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5443\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jehohanan #4</span>.</p></li><li><p>He was a priest and the leader of Malluch&apos;s family during Joiakim&apos;s time as high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:14\">Nehemiah 12:14</a>).</p></li><li><p>A priest, father of Zechariah, and a descendant of Asaph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:35\">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).</p></li><li><p>The secretary whose house held Jeremiah as a prisoner during King Zedekiah&apos;s rule in Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer37:15,Jer37:20\">Jeremiah 37:15, 20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:26\">38:26</a>).</p></li><li><p>Kareah&apos;s son sought protection from Gedaliah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer40:8\">Jeremiah 40:8</a>).</p></li><li><p>Jonathan was the youngest son of Mattathias and brother of Judas Maccabeus. After Judas died in battle against Bacchides (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc9:18\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 9:18</a>), Jonathan took his place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc9:28-1Macc9:31\">9:28–31</a>). For three years, Jonathan led a small group of fighters against Syria. The Syrians were distracted by their own political struggles, so in 157 BC, they made peace with him. These political issues in Syria helped Jonathan. </p><p>Five years later, he became the high priest in Jerusalem and the administrator of Judea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc10:1-1Macc10:11\">1 Maccabees 10:1–11</a>). Under his leadership, Jewish territory and power grew. Jonathan skillfully played Syrian political rivals against each other. One rival was Tryphon, who wanted the Syrian throne and felt threatened by Jonathan. In 143 BC, Tryphon decided to overthrow Jonathan. He captured Jonathan through deceit and eventually killed him, leaving his brother Simon to lead the Jews (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc12:1-1Macc13:53\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 10:12–13</a>).</p></li></ol>",
