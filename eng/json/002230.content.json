    "content": "<h1>GLORIFICATION</h1><p>An expression of God&apos;s glory and splendor. </p><p>In Hebrew, the word for &quot;glory&quot; originally meant &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;important.&quot; Over time, it came to describe someone influential, rich, or powerful. In ancient times, wealthy and powerful people wore fine clothes and jewels. Because of this, a person&apos;s glory referred to the visible signs of their wealth and power. Glory also came to mean beauty because fine clothes and jewels were beautiful. This idea of glory was later extended to God.</p><h2>Glory of God</h2><p>In the Old Testament, God&apos;s glory refers to something clear and obvious about him. The book of Exodus contains many references to God&apos;s glory. For example, there was the fiery pillar, and God&apos;s glory entered the holy of holies in the tabernacle (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38\">Exodus 40:34–38</a>).</p><p>When the tabernacle was being built (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:1-Exod27:21\">Exodus 25–27</a>), glory and beauty were connected. Some believe that the &quot;goodness&quot; of the Lord that Moses saw (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:19\">Exodus 33:19</a>) could also be translated as &quot;beauty.&quot; Therefore, God&apos;s glory can also mean his beauty.</p><p>The New Testament continues the Old Testament idea that God is full of glory (see the vision of God in his glory in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:1-Rev4:11\">Revelation 4</a>). However, the New Testament focuses more on the glory of Christ. The transfiguration of Christ showed his glory openly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:8\">Matthew 17:1–8</a>). The apostle Paul called Jesus the Lord of glory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor2:8\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:8</a>) and said that God&apos;s glory shone from his face (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:18\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</a>). The Gospel of John is especially known as the &quot;Gospel of Glory.&quot; In the Incarnation (when the Son of God became human), Jesus showed the glory he had as the only Son of the Father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>). The raising of Lazarus was another example of God&apos;s glory shown through Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:40\">John 11:40</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:26\">John 17</a>, Jesus prayed about his glory and said that his disciples would also share in it.</p><h2>Glorification of the Believer</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:18\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</a>, spiritual transformation is described as changing &quot;from glory to glory.&quot; Glorification is the final step in this transformation. In the process of salvation, Paul lists glorification as the last event (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:30\">Romans 8:28–30</a>). The verb used in<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:30\"> Romans 8:30</a> is in the past tense, which suggests the certainty and finality of glorification. Glorification is the completion, perfection, and full realization of salvation.</p><p>Glorification is found in perfect sanctification (the process of becoming holy) as it relates to a person&apos;s inner character. No single passage in the Bible covers this theme in detail, but <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:27\">Ephesians 5:27</a> gives a good summary. In this passage, Paul wrote about presenting the church to Christ. What Paul says about the church applies to each Christian. Jesus will present the church to himself in &quot;<span>without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless</span>.&quot; Similarly, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:10</a>, Paul says, &quot;<span>I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory</span>.&quot;</p><p>Just as a believer&apos;s inner character is glorified, so is their body. Paul calls the resurrection of the body the &quot;redemption of our bodies&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:23\">Romans 8:23</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:21\">Philippians 3:21</a>, Paul speaks of changing our bodies of humiliation (bodies weakened by sin and mortality) into bodies of glory like Christ&apos;s. The power that will do this is the same power of God that controls everything.</p><p>The most detailed discussion of the glorification of the body is found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15</a>, with additional details in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:21\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5</a>. Paul’s theme in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15</a> is that just as Christians have the mortal bodies of Adam, they will have immortal bodies like the Son of God. Paul contrasts these two bodies. The present body can be destroyed, but the resurrection body will be imperishable. The current body is one of dishonor, but the resurrection body will be glorious. The current body is weak, but the resurrection body will be powerful. The present body belongs to this physical world, but the resurrection body will belong to the future, spiritual, eternal world.</p><p>Salvation involves: </p><ul><li><p>Justification (being declared righteous)</p></li><li><p>Regeneration (being made new)</p></li><li><p>Sanctification (becoming holy)</p></li></ul><p>In the life to come, it includes the glorification of the inner person and the resurrection of the body in glory. A glorified person must also live in a glorified environment. Therefore, the Bible ends with a description of a glorious new heaven, new earth, and a new Jerusalem.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4656\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Glory</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Resurrection</span>.</p>",
