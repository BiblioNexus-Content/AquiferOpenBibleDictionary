    "content": "<h1>MOSES</h1><p>The great leader of the Hebrew people who led them out of slavery in Egypt to the promised land of Canaan. He gave them the law at Mount Sinai, which became the foundation of their religious faith for centuries. Moses took on many roles, including:</p><ul><li><p>Prophet</p></li><li><p>Priest</p></li><li><p>Lawgiver</p></li><li><p>Judge</p></li><li><p>Intercessor</p></li><li><p>Shepherd</p></li><li><p>Miracle worker</p></li><li><p>Founder of a nation</p></li></ul><p>The meaning of his name is uncertain. It might be a Hebrew word meaning &quot;to draw out&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:10\">Exodus 2:10</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam22:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps18:16\">Psalm 18:16</a>). If Pharaoh&apos;s daughter, who found him, gave him an Egyptian name, it might mean &quot;son,&quot; as seen in Egyptian names like Ahmose, Thutmose, and Ramses. No one else in the Old Testament has this name.</p><p>Moses is the greatest figure in the Old Testament, mentioned by name 767 times. His influence extends to the New Testament, where he is mentioned 79 times. The first 40 years of his life were spent in Pharaoh&apos;s household, where he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:23\">Acts 7:23</a>). </p><p>For the next 40 years, he lived in Midian as a fugitive after killing an Egyptian who was mistreating a Hebrew. His last 40 years were dedicated to leading the Israelites out of Egypt to the land God promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">Genesis 12:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">3</a>). He died at the age of 120 after leading the Israelites through 40 years of wandering in the wilderness. He brought them to the edge of the promised land on the east side of the Jordan River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:7\">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>). Moses is one of history&apos;s great figures, turning a group of slaves into a nation that has profoundly influenced the course of history.</p><h2>Preview</h2><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Background</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">The First 40 Years—In Egypt</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">The Second 40 Years—In Midian</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">The Third 40 Years—From Egypt to Canaan</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Moses in the New Testament</a></p><h2>Background</h2><p>We only know about the life of Moses from the Bible. Archaeology confirms the events surrounding Moses but does not know that he existed or what he did. His story begins with the arrival in Egypt of Jacob, his sons, and their families during a famine in Canaan. After being invited by Joseph and welcomed by Pharaoh, the family settled in Goshen in northeast Egypt, They lived there for 430 years (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:40\">Exodus 12:40</a>). Over time, their numbers grew rapidly, filling the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:7\">Exodus 1:7</a>). A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. The Bible does not name this pharaoh, and his identity is debated. He is often identified as:</p><ul><li><p>Thutmose III, who was pharaoh from 1504 to 1451 BC;</p></li><li><p>Seti I, who was pharaoh from 1304 to 1290 BC; or </p></li><li><p>Ramses II, who was pharaoh from 1290 to 1224 BC. </p></li></ul><p>Pharaoh was afraid that the Israelites were becoming too many and could become dangerous. So, he tried to reduce their population. He put them to work building the store cities of Pithom and Rameses, but the harsh labor did not reduce their numbers. He then tried to get the midwives to kill the male babies, but they refused to follow his orders. Finally, he commanded his own people to drown the male infants in the Nile River. It was against this backdrop of the first-known Jewish persecution that baby Moses was born.</p><h2>The First 40 Years—In Egypt</h2><h3>Birth and Early Life</h3><p>A man from the family of Levi named Amram married his father&apos;s sister, Jochebed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:20\">Exodus 6:20</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:1\">2:1</a>). Their first son, Aaron, was born three years before Moses and before the command to drown Hebrew babies, so his life was not in danger. However, the cruel order was in force when Moses was born. After three months, his mother could no longer hide him. She took a basket made of bulrushes and coated it with bitumen and pitch. She then placed the baby in it and put the basket among the reeds along the riverbank. His older sister, Miriam, stayed nearby to watch what would happen.</p><p>Soon, Pharaoh&apos;s daughter came to the river to bathe, as she did often. (She is identified by Josephus as Thermuthis and by others as Hatshepsut, though her actual identity is unknown.) She discovered the baby, recognized him as a Hebrew child, and decided to raise him as her own. Miriam then approached and offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the child. The princess agreed, and Miriam brought the baby back to his mother, who nursed him for perhaps two or three years (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:19-1Sam1:24\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:19-1Sam1:24\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:19-1Sam1:24\">24</a>). </p><p>Nothing is recorded about those early years. It is unknown whether his mother saw him in his later childhood and young adulthood or if she told him who he was and taught him the Hebrew faith. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, fitting for a member of the royal household, and became mighty in his words and deeds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:22\">Acts 7:22</a>).</p><h3>Identification with His Own People</h3><p>It is unclear when Moses first learned he was a Hebrew rather than an Egyptian, but by the time he was 40 years old, he knew. One day, he went out to visit his people and see how they were treated. The cruel measures taken against them at the time of his birth were still in place. When he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, Moses killed the Egyptian in anger and buried him. He thought no one had noticed, but someone did. The next day, when he tried to stop two Hebrews from fighting, they turned on him and accused him of murder: “<span>Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:14\">Exodus 2:14</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:25\">Acts 7:25</a> adds: “<span>He assumed his brothers would understand that God was using him to deliver them, but they did not.</span>” Realizing that his actions were known and that being part of Pharaoh&apos;s household would not protect him, Moses fled to Midian.</p><h2>The Second 40 Years—In Midian</h2><h3>Marriage into the Family of Jethro</h3><p>After arriving in Midian, Moses sat down by a well. There, he saw the seven daughters of the priest of Midian drawing water for their father&apos;s flock. When shepherds tried to drive them away, Moses helped them water their animals. The priest, Jethro, invited Moses to stay with his family and gave him his daughter Zipporah as a wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:1\">Exodus 3:1</a>; Jethro is also called Reuel in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:18\">Exodus 2:18</a>; or Hobab in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:29\">Numbers 10:29</a>). There is some disagreement among scholars regarding Hobab’s identity in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:29\">Numbers 10:29.</a> Some think he was Moses’s father-in-law, while others think he was Moses’s brother-in-law. </p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5034\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hobab</span></p><p>In Midian, Moses and Zipporah had two sons, Gershom and Eliezer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:22\">Exodus 2:22</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:4\"> 18:4</a>). During his 40 years in Midian, Moses&apos;s thoughts about his life in Egypt likely faded. He could not have foreseen that God would soon call him back to Egypt to confront the new Pharaoh and demand the release of the Hebrews from bondage. God had not forgotten his people and was now ready to deliver them.</p><h3>Encounter with God at the Burning Bush</h3><p>One day, while Moses was taking care of the flocks of his father-in-law, he led them to Mount Horeb (also known as Sinai). God appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush that burned but was not consumed. Moses approached to observe the strange sight more closely and heard God speak to him out of the bush:</p><p>“Moses, Moses!” “Here I am,” he answered. “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:4-Exod3:5\">Exodus 3:4</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:4-Exod3:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:4-Exod3:5\">5</a>). </p><p>God identified Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and assured Moses that He had heard His people&apos;s cries and was aware of their suffering. God revealed His plan to send Moses to Egypt to deliver His people from bondage.</p><p>Moses, feeling unable to do the task, began making excuses. God assured Moses that He would be with him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:11-Exod3:12\">Exodus 3:11</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:11-Exod3:12\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:11-Exod3:12\">12</a>). When Moses expressed concern about what to say if the people asked for God&apos;s name, God responded mysteriously: “<span>I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:14\">Exodus 3:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:14\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:14\">14</a>). Scholars have proposed many meanings for the name. What is certain is that the name suggests that God exists through his own power and is sufficient for himself.</p><p>Moses then worried that the people would not believe him. God gave him three signs: </p><ol><li><p>turning his staff into a serpent </p></li><li><p>making his hand leprous </p></li><li><p>turning water from the Nile into blood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:1-Exod4:9\">Exodus 4:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:1-Exod4:9\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:1-Exod4:9\">9</a>). </p></li></ol><p>Despite these signs, Moses still hesitated: <span>“Please, Lord...I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and tongue.”</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:10\">Exodus 4:10</a>). God told him that he would tell him what to say. Nonetheless, Moses asked God to send someone else. God finally agreed to let Moses&apos;s brother, Aaron, speak for him. God would give His instructions to Moses, and Aaron would relay them to the people.</p><h3>Return to Egypt</h3><p>Moses took his wife and sons and set out for Egypt, telling his father-in-law that he wanted to visit his family there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:18\">Exodus 4:18</a>). According to the biblical account, he put his wife and sons on a donkey for the journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:20\">Exodus 4:20</a>). This shows that both children were young and had not been born early in Moses’s marriage. </p><p>At a rest stop on the journey, something strange happened. The Lord met Moses and tried to kill him because Moses did not circumcise his baby before leaving Midian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:24\">Exodus 4:24</a>). When Zipporah realized Moses’s life was in danger, she performed the circumcision herself. She then said to her husband, “<span>Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:25\">Exodus 4:25</a>). This strange event was a reminder that the leader of the covenant people must follow the covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14\">Genesis 17:10</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:10-Gen17:14\">14</a>). (Israel was God&apos;s covenant people because God made a covenant [special agreement] with them that the men would be circumcised.)</p><p>God told Aaron, who was still in Egypt, to go to the mountain where Moses had met God at the burning bush and meet his brother there. Moses told Aaron everything that had happened, and together they went to Egypt, gathered the elders, and informed them of these events. When Moses and Aaron performed the signs in front of the people, they believed these leaders had been sent by God to save them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:30-Exod4:31\">Exodus 4:30</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:30-Exod4:31\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:30-Exod4:31\">31</a>).</p><h2>The Third 40 Years—From Egypt to Canaan</h2><h3>The Encounter with Pharaoh</h3><p>Soon after his return to Egypt, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. Moses repeated the demands of the Lord: “<span>‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1\">Exodus 5:1</a>). Pharaoh refused, saying he had never heard of this God. Since Egyptian kings thought of themselves as gods, Pharaoh felt very insulted. He not only refused Moses’s request but also made the Hebrews work harder. They now had to gather their own straw to make bricks, but still had to make the same number of bricks as before. </p><p>The Hebrews were upset and angry and blamed Moses for their troubles. Moses, confused and upset, complained to God. God reassured Moses that He would free the Hebrews from their slavery and bring them to the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He told Moses to go back to Pharaoh and repeat the demand, warning of serious consequences if Pharaoh refused.</p><p>When Moses and Aaron went back to Pharaoh, Moses repeated his request to let the Israelites go. He tried to show Pharaoh a miracle by turning his rod into a snake. But the Egyptian wise men did the same thing with their magic, so Pharaoh still refused to listen. Then, Moses brought nine plagues to Egypt to show God&apos;s power and force Pharaoh to obey. These plagues included: </p><ol><li><p>Turning the Nile water into blood</p></li><li><p>A plague of frogs</p></li><li><p>Gnats</p></li><li><p>Flies</p></li><li><p>A disease on livestock</p></li><li><p>Boils on people</p></li><li><p>Hail</p></li><li><p>Locusts</p></li><li><p>Complete darkness </p></li></ol><p>During some of these plagues, Pharaoh would agree to let the Israelites go, but once the plague was over, he would change his mind and refuse again. The first nine plagues caused terrible damage to Egypt, but the Israelites were still not freed. There was one more plague to come, the worst of all.</p><h3>The First Passover</h3><p>God told Moses that there was one more plague coming to Egypt: “<span>Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl behind the hand mill, as well as the firstborn of all the cattle</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:5\">Exodus 11:5</a>). He promised Moses that the plague would not affect the Hebrews, “<span>Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:7\">Exodus 11:7</a>).</p><p>God instructed the people through Moses and Aaron to get ready to leave Egypt quickly. They were to ask the Egyptians for their silver and gold jewelry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:2-Exod11:3\">Exodus 11:2</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:2-Exod11:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:2-Exod11:3\">3</a>). The Egyptians agreed, likely out of fear and hoping the gifts would stop the terrors. The Hebrews were also told to prepare a lamb for each family for their last meal in Egypt. This became the pattern for the Jewish Passover. They were to put the lamb’s blood on the doorposts and lintels of their houses, where the Passover meal would be eaten that night. Wherever the blood was on the door, no harm would come to that household. They were also told to prepare unleavened bread (bread that has not been left to rise).</p><p>At midnight, an angel from the Lord killed all the firstborns in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the lowest prisoner; no one was saved. When Pharaoh saw what had happened, he ordered Moses and the Israelites to leave immediately (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:31-Exod12:32\">Exodus 12:31</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:31-Exod12:32\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:31-Exod12:32\">32</a>). The Bible says about 600,000 Hebrew men left Egypt. Including women and children, the total would have been over 2 million people.</p><h3>The Exodus from Egypt</h3><p>The exodus is the central event of the Old Testament and marks the birth of Israel as a nation. Jewish people still look back to this event as the great act of God saving his people, much like Christians see the cross as the key act of their faith.</p><p>We cannot know the exact route the Hebrews took out of Egypt, though many ideas have been suggested. They did not take the shortest route to Canaan, which would have been about a 10-day journey along the Mediterranean coast. Instead, they headed toward Mt. Sinai, where Moses had earlier met God at the burning bush. God told Moses He would bring the people to that same spot as a sign that Moses had been sent to deliver them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:12\">Exodus 3:12</a>). The Hebrews also remembered Joseph&apos;s request to carry his bones with them when they returned to their land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:25\">Genesis 50:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod13:19\">Exodus 13:19</a>).</p><p>As the people traveled, they were led by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night. These pillars represented God&apos;s presence and guided them along their route.</p><p>Back in Egypt, Pharaoh regretted letting the Hebrews go and decided to chase them with his army. When the Hebrews saw the approaching Egyptian army, they were terrified. The sea was in front of them, and the Egyptians were behind them; there seemed to be no escape. The people blamed Moses for bringing them out of Egypt. God assured them they did not need to be afraid or do anything to defend themselves. He promised to fight for them and give them victory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:14\">Exodus 14:14</a>).</p><p>The Lord parted the waters of the Sea of Reeds (often mistakenly called the Red Sea) with a strong east wind, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground. The Egyptians followed them into the sea. But, the waters crashed down and destroyed the Egyptian army. The Israelites were safe on the other side. The people celebrated their deliverance in song (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:27\">Exodus 15</a>) and continued their journey. The narrative that follows describes the Israelites&apos; struggles to survive in the desert: </p><ul><li><p>The Israelites had problems with food and water.</p></li><li><p>The Israelites argued among themselves.</p></li><li><p>The Israelites complained about Moses.</p></li><li><p>The Israelites had battles with enemies.</p></li></ul><p>Through all their experiences, Moses stood as the unifying force and great spiritual leader.</p><p>Despite witnessing God&apos;s great act of deliverance, the Israelites&apos; faith was weak. Three days later, they found undrinkable water and complained about Moses. The Lord showed Moses how to purify the water, satisfying the people&apos;s needs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:22-Exod15:25\">Exodus 15:22</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:22-Exod15:25\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:22-Exod15:25\">25</a>). When they reached the wilderness of Sin, they complained again due to a lack of food. God provided manna, a bread-like substance, to feed them until they reached Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:21\">Exodus 16:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:21\">21</a>). Later, camped at Rephidim, the people complained again about the lack of water. God supplied water from a rock at Horeb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7\">Exodus 17:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:7\">7</a>). The Amalekites attacked them at Rephidim, but God gave the Israelites a great victory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13\">Exodus 18:8</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13\">13</a>).</p><p>Moses and the people reached Sinai and camped there. Jethro, Moses&apos;s father-in-law, came to visit, bringing Moses&apos;s wife and sons. Zipporah had apparently decided to stay with her father rather than go to Egypt with Moses. It was a joyful reunion, and Jethro made a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. Moses could not settle all the disputes of the Hebrews by himself. So, Jethro suggested that Moses give some tasks to responsible men among the people. Moses agreed, and Jethro returned to his land. He did not stay at Sinai to take part in the ratification of the covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:27\">Exodus 18:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:27\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:27\">27</a>).</p><h3>Giving of the Law at Sinai</h3><p>God kept his promise to Moses. God lead the Hebrews out of slavery and lead them to Mount Sinai, where he originally called Moses. God created an agreement with Israel there. God descended onto Sinai and called Moses to come up to the mountaintop. There were dramatic displays of lightning, thunder, thick clouds, fire, smoke, and an earthquake. Moses remained there for 40 days to receive the law, which formed the covenant&apos;s foundation.</p><p>At Sinai, God revealed Himself as a deity who demands His people&apos;s worship in all aspects of life and wants a personal relationship with them.</p><h3>Apostasy of the People</h3><p>During Moses&apos;s long stay on Mount Sinai, the people grew impatient and doubted that he would come back. They asked Aaron to create idols for worship. Aaron collected gold earrings from the people, melted them down, and fashioned a golden calf. “<span>He took the gold from their hands, and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf. And they said, ‘These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt’</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:4\">Exodus 32:4</a>). </p><p>The next day they worshipped the idol with sacrifices and celebration. God informed Moses of the people&apos;s actions and intended to destroy them, offering to make a great nation from Moses&apos;s descendants. Moses interceded for the people, and God&apos;s anger subsided. Moses descended the mountain with the stone tablets inscribed with the law. Upon seeing the idolatry, he broke the tablets in anger, ground the calf into powder, mixed it with water, and made the people drink it. Confronting Aaron, Moses demanded an explanation, but Aaron minimized his role, saying, “I threw them [the gold] into the fire—and out came this calf!” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:24\">Exodus 32:24</a>). </p><p>Moses called for volunteers to execute God’s judgment on the people. The Levites responded and killed about 3,000 men, later receiving commendation and reward (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:9-Deut33:10\">Deuteronomy 33:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:9-Deut33:10\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:9-Deut33:10\">10</a>). Moses again interceded for the people, requesting to be destroyed if God could not forgive them. God relented and promised His angel would still accompany them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:34\">Exodus 32:34</a>).</p><p>Moses requested to see God&apos;s glory. God instructed him to carve out two more stone tablets and return to the mountain. There, God proclaimed His name: “<span>The LORD, the LORD God, is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6\">Exodus 34:6</a>). Moses spent another 40 days on the mountain, being warned about idolatry, being given rules, and getting another copy of the Ten Commandments. When he came down, his face was shining from speaking with God. The people were afraid of him. Moses put a cover over his face. He removed it when in God’s presence. Paul explained that the cover prevented the people from seeing the heavenly light fade from Moses&apos;s face (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:13\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:13</a>).</p><h3>The Tabernacle and Establishment of the Priesthood</h3><p>During Moses&apos;s first climb up the mountain to receive the law, God told him to collect materials to build the tabernacle. The tabernacle was a portable sanctuary used for worship. The materials used to build the tabernacle included: </p><ul><li><p>Gold</p></li><li><p>Silver</p></li><li><p>Bronze</p></li><li><p>Various colored yarns</p></li><li><p>Fine linen</p></li><li><p>Goat&apos;s hair</p></li><li><p>Tanned skins</p></li><li><p>Acacia wood</p></li><li><p>Oil for lamps</p></li><li><p>Spices for anointing oil and incense</p></li><li><p>Precious stones (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:3-Exod25:7\">Exodus 25:3</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:3-Exod25:7\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:3-Exod25:7\">7</a>)</p></li></ul><p>God gave him specific building instructions and rituals for dedicating the priests. Bezalel, assisted by Oholiab, was appointed to oversee the tabernacle&apos;s construction (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod31:1-Exod31:6\">Exodus 31:1–6</a>). The tabernacle was portable, like a tent, so it could be taken down and moved from place to place as the Hebrews continued their journey toward Canaan.</p><p>God also gave Moses instructions for various burnt, grain, peace, sin, and guilt offerings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev7:38\">Leviticus 1–7</a>).</p><p>Moses performed the solemn ceremony to ordain Aaron and his sons as priests and begin worship practices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev9:24\">Leviticus 8–9</a>).</p><p>After the first ceremonies, Nadab and Abihu, Aaron&apos;s sons, offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. Because they did this, they were consumed by divine fire. Moses prevented Aaron and his remaining sons from mourning, emphasizing the holiness violated by the act (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7\">Leviticus 10:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7\">7</a>). This event highlights the importance of holy living, about which the rest of Leviticus gives regulations.</p><h3>From Sinai to Kadesh</h3><p>A year after leaving Egypt, the Israelites took a census (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num9:1\">Numbers 9:1</a>). God reminded them to observe the Passover. A month later, they set out from Sinai, complaining about their boring diet of manna and longing for Egyptian foods like:</p><ul><li><p>Fish</p></li><li><p>Cucumbers</p></li><li><p>Melons</p></li><li><p>Leeks</p></li><li><p>Onions</p></li><li><p>Garlic (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:4-Num11:6\">Numbers 11:4</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:4-Num11:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:4-Num11:6\">6</a>) </p></li></ul><p>In anger, God sent quail, but many died from a plague as they ate the meat.</p><p>Miriam and Aaron also complained against Moses, particularly regarding his Cushite wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:2\">Numbers 12:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:2\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:2\">2</a>). Whether the Cushite was Ethiopian or another reference to Zipporah is unclear. If Moses did marry a second time, it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament. Moses remained silent, and God defended him, smiting Miriam with leprosy. Aaron acknowledged their sin, and Moses&apos;s intercession led to Miriam’s healing after seven days.</p><p>While the people were at Kadesh (also called Kadesh-barnea in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:8\">Numbers 32:8</a>), Moses sent 12 men into Canaan. One man from each tribe was sent to spy out the land to get ready for Israel&apos;s entry. After&nbsp;40 days, the spies returned. They agreed that the land was fertile and inviting, ten of them were afraid of&nbsp;the Canaanites and recommended not to go into the land. Only Joshua and Caleb urged the Israelites to trust in God and move forward into Canaan. This underscores their unique courage and loyalty. </p><p>Despite their encouragement, the Israelites&apos; fear and lack of faith led them to reject this plan. Instead, they conspired to return to Egypt and appoint a new leader. Their rebellion reached a peak when they threatened to stone Moses and Aaron. This crisis prompted divine intervention. God, angered by their persistent disobedience, was ready to destroy the people. However, Moses interceded (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num14:19\">Numbers 13:1–14:19</a>). He said that if God did not bring the people into Canaan, the nations would believe that the God of the Israelites was not able to bring them into the land. </p><p>God listened to Moses and decreed that none of the men aged 20 and older who had voiced their complaints would enter the promised land. This decision meant they had to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation had died. Their children would be the ones to enter Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:29-Num14:33\">Numbers 14:29</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:29-Num14:33\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:29-Num14:33\">33</a>). Upon hearing this judgment, the Israelites, in an attempt to reverse their fate, decided to enter the land immediately. However, this action, done without God&apos;s blessing, resulted in a large defeat by the Amalekites and Canaanites.</p><h3>Forty Years in the Wilderness</h3><p>Very little is known about events during the 40 years of wilderness wanderings. The Israelites repeatedly showed a lack of faith and obedience despite receiving signs and punishments. A man named Korah led another rebellion against the authority of Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron pleaded with God not to punish the entire community for the rebellion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:22-Num16:24\">Numbers 16:22</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:22-Num16:24\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:22-Num16:24\">24</a>). God separated the Israelites from the rebels. While the people watched, the ground split open and swallowed them up, as well as their families and possessions. Despite seeing this punishment, the Israelites still complained about Moses and Aaron. This caused a plague that killed 14,700 people before Moses stopped it. </p><p>To confirm Aaron’s leadership, God instructed Moses to gather a rod from each tribe and place them in the Tent of Meeting. Aaron’s rod budded, bloomed, and produced almonds, showing that God chose him. Yet, the people still complained.</p><p>As the Israelites neared the end of their wanderings, Miriam died and was buried in Kadesh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1\">Numbers 20:1</a>). Soon after, the people grumbled for lack of water. God told Moses to speak to a rock to bring forth water, but Moses, in a moment of frustration, struck the rock twice with his rod. Though water flowed, God rebuked Moses and Aaron: “<span>Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them</span>!” (verse<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:12\"> 12</a>). Moses and Aaron were honoring themselves over God. Because of the sin, they were not allowed to take the Israelites into the promised land. This severe punishment shows that the leadership given to Moses and Aaron was a privilege that came with a lot of responsibility.</p><p>The Israelites traveled from Kadesh to Mount Hor, near the border of Edom. There, Aaron died. Moses took Aaron&apos;s priestly garments and gave them to his son Eleazar, passing on the role of priest to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:28\">Numbers 20:28</a>).</p><p>As they continued their journey, they encountered various forms of resistance. They won a victory over the king of Arad at Hormah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:1-Num21:3\">Numbers 21:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:1-Num21:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:1-Num21:3\">3</a>). However, during their trek around Edom, the people complained again about the lack of food and water. This time God sent poisonous snakes among them. Many of them died from the snake bites. Those who had not yet been bitten came to Moses, acknowledged their sin, and asked that the serpents be taken away. God instructed Moses to make a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. If a person bitten by a serpent looked up at the bronze serpent, he or she would live.</p><p>As they approached the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites, the Israelites requested peaceful passage but were met with hostility. In the ensuing battle, Israel defeated Sihon, capturing his land and cities, thus continuing their progress toward the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:25\">Numbers 21:21</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:25\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:25\">25</a>).</p><h3>Arrival at the Jordan River</h3><p>After the Israelites defeated Sihon, they camped in the plains of Moab, opposite Jericho. They could see the promised land from there. The Moabites felt scared of the Israelites because of their recent victories. To harm the Israelites, Balak, the king of Moab, hired Balaam, a magician, to curse them. However, God turned each of Balaam&apos;s three attempts to curse the Israelites into blessings instead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25\">Numbers 22–24</a>). </p><p>Although Balaam could not curse Israel, he caused more trouble by advising the Moabites to tempt the Israelites into idolatry and immoral behavior (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:3\">Numbers 25:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:3\">3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num31:16\">31:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:15\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:14\">Revelation 2:14</a>). The Moabites followed this advice. They sacrificed to the Moabite gods and joined in pagan worship. This angered God, and He sent a plague that killed 24,000 Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:9\">Numbers 25:9</a>). This event marked an early instance of Israel’s struggle with idolatry, which foreshadowed future struggles with idolatry in Canaan. Their continued idolatry would eventually lead to their ruin.</p><p>After the plague, God instructed Moses and Eleazar to take a census similar to the one taken 40 years earlier. Although an entire generation had died in the wilderness, a new generation had grown, and their numbers were almost the same. The census counted 601,730 men aged 20 and older who were fit for war (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:51\">Numbers 26:51</a>). Every man on the first census had died except Caleb and Joshua.</p><p>God then commanded Moses to commission Joshua as his successor in a public ceremony witnessed by Eleazar, the priest, and the congregation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:12-Num27:23\">Numbers 27:12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:12-Num27:23\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:12-Num27:23\">23</a>). Moses was also given instructions regarding feasts, offerings, and vows (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num28:1-Num30:16\">Numbers 28–30</a>). As Moses&apos;s final act of leadership, God ordered him to avenge Israel on the Midianites. In this campaign, the Israelites achieved a decisive victory, killing the Midianite kings and Balaam.</p><p>The Lord provided Moses with detailed instructions for the boundaries of the promised land and named the leaders who would divide it among the tribes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:1-Num34:29\">Numbers 34</a>). God also gave the Levites 48 cities, including six cities of refuge. These cities protected those accused of manslaughter, ensuring that they would receive a fair trial before the people rather than being harmed in revenge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:1-Num35:34\">Numbers 35</a>).</p><h3>Moses’s Death</h3><p>The book of Deuteronomy serves as Moses’s farewell address to the Israelites, presenting his final instructions and reflections before his death. In this book, Moses stands as the sole speaker, addressing the gathered congregation and recounting their journey since leaving Mount Sinai. He reviews their past failures, including the refusal to enter the promised land 38 years earlier (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:14\">Deuteronomy 2:14</a>). He recalled on his request to cross the Jordan and see the land. God had granted Moses only a view of the land from the top of Mount Pisgah, but did not allow him to enter it. </p><p>Moses uses this occasion to urge the people to follow God&apos;s laws and commandments, emphasizing that their obedience will lead to blessings in the land they are about to enter.</p><p>As Moses nears the end of his life, God instructs him and Joshua to meet at the Tent of Meeting, where Joshua is formally commissioned as the new leader of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:23\">Deuteronomy 31:14</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:23\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:23\">23</a>). Before his death, Moses blesses the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:1-Deut33:29\">Deuteronomy 33</a>). </p><p>Moses then ascends Mount Nebo, specifically to the peak of Pisgah, where God shows him the promised land, although he is not permitted to cross into it himself. Moses dies there, and God Himself buries him in a valley in Moab, opposite Beth-peor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:6\">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>). </p><p>Moses was 120 years old when he died, and the Israelites mourned his death for 30 days. The final tribute to Moses in Deuteronomy 34:10 reflects his unique relationship with God: “<span>Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:10\">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>).</p><h2>Moses in the New Testament</h2><p>All Jews and Christians in the New Testament times considered Moses the author of the Pentateuch. The following expressions show that he was associated with the books in the Old Testament attributed to him: </p><ul><li><p>“The law of Moses” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:22\">Luke 2:22</a>)</p></li><li><p>“Why did Moses order” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:7\">Matthew 19:7</a>)</p></li><li><p>“Moses said” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:10\">Mark 7:10</a>) </p></li><li><p>“Moses wrote” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:19\">Mark 12:19</a>) </p></li></ul><p>He is mentioned in the New Testament more than any other Old Testament figure, a total of 79 times. He is mostly represented as the lawgiver (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:4\">Matthew 8:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:10\">Mark 7:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:17\">John 1:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:1\">Acts 15:1</a>). He appears at the transfiguration of Jesus, representing the Old Testament law. Elijah also appeared, representing the Old Testament prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3\">Matthew 17:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:1-Matt17:3\">3</a>).</p><p>Moses is also represented as a prophet in the New Testament. As a prophet, he spoke of the coming Messiah and his sufferings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27\">Luke 24:25</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:25-Luke24:27\">27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:22\">Acts 3:22</a>). The New Testament connects Moses and Jesus to illustrate patterns of life under the new covenant. For example:</p><ul><li><p>The nativity story of Jesus parallels the story of Moses as an infant deliverer who escapes from the murderous plans of an earthly ruler (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:18\">Matthew 2:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:18\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:18\">18</a>). </p></li><li><p>Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount mirrors the giving of the law at Sinai, presenting Him as the authoritative interpreter of God’s will (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:29\">Matthew 5–7</a>). </p></li><li><p>Paul contrasts the old law with the new relationship with God in Galatians. The law given through Moses prepared people for the faith in Christ that now justifies believers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:5-Heb3:6\">Hebrews 3:5</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:5-Heb3:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:5-Heb3:6\">6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:22\">9:11</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:22\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:11-Heb9:22\">22</a>). </p></li><li><p>John’s Gospel contrasts the law given through Moses with the grace and truth that came through Jesus Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:17\">John 1:17</a>). </p></li><li><p>John also compares the manna in the wilderness to Jesus as “the bread of life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:30-John6:35\">John 6:30</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:30-John6:35\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:30-John6:35\">35</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Other references to Moses or to events associated with him include:</p><ul><li><p>His birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:20\">Acts 7:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:23\">Hebrews 11:23</a>)</p></li><li><p>The burning bush (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:37\">Luke 20:37</a>)</p></li><li><p>The magicians of Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:8\">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:8</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Passover (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:28\">Hebrews 11:28</a>)</p></li><li><p>The exodus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:16\">Hebrews 3:16</a>)</p></li><li><p>The crossing of the sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:2\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:2</a>)</p></li><li><p>The covenant sacrifice at Sinai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:28\">Matthew 26:28</a>)</p></li><li><p>The manna (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:3\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:3</a>)</p></li><li><p>The glory on Moses’s face (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:7-2Cor3:18\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:7</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:7-2Cor3:18\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:7-2Cor3:18\">18</a>)</p></li><li><p>The water from the rock (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:4\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4</a>)</p></li><li><p>The bronze serpent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:14\">John 3:14</a>)</p></li><li><p>The song of Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev15:3\">Revelation 15:3</a>)</p></li></ul><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4122\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Egypt, Egyptian</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4375\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Exodus, The</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6925\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Plagues upon Egypt</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7864\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Tabernacle</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Temple</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3786\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Commandments, The Ten</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p>",
