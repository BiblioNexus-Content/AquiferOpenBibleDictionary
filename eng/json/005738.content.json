Uzzah was struck dead by the Lord because he reached out and took hold of the ark when he tried to steady it. This action went against the instructions of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num4:15\">Numbers 4:15</a>. Uzzah&apos;s brother, Ahio, was apparently leading the oxen that pulled the cart, while Uzzah walked beside it. Because of this event, David renamed the place Perez-uzzah (which means “the breaking forth against Uzzah”). David left the ark at the home of Obed-edom.</p></li><li><p>A Levite from the clan of Merari. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:29\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:29</a> lists him as the son of Shimei and the father of Shimea.</p></li></ol>",
