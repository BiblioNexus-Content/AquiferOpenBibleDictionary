    "content": "<h1>DILL</h1><p>Dill (<em>Anethum graveolens</em>) is a weedy annual plant that looks similar to parsley and fennel. It grows 30.5 to 50.8 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) tall and has yellow flowers. People used dill as a general seasoning, especially for pickles. It also had some medical uses. This plant is grown in many places for its seeds. The seeds have a strong, pleasant smell and help with digestion.</p><p>The King James Version translates the Greek word <em>anÄ“thon </em>in<em> </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:23\">Matthew 23:23</a> as &quot;anise&quot; instead of &quot;dill.&quot; This is considered incorrect by most scholars. </p>",
