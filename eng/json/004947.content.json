The nation that descended from Seir was first expelled by the descendants of Esau. But later they intermarried with them. This may be why the ancestry of Abraham includes Seir and his descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:20-Gen36:21\">Genesis 36:20â€“21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:38</a>).</p>",
