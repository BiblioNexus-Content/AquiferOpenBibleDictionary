Mt Seir was bordered by the great valley of Arabah on the west and by desert on the east. Seir is the modern Jebel esh-Shera.</p><p>Seir was formerly inhabited by the Horites, whose defeat to King Kedorlaomer is recorded in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:4-Gen14:6\">Genesis 14:4–6</a>. The Horites were later dispossessed from this region by Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:12\">Dt 2:12</a>); however, a remnant of Horite chiefs was listed among the descendants of Esau living in Seir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:20-Gen36:30\">Gn 36:20–30</a>). As this area was given by the Lord as an inheritance to Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:4\">Jos 24:4</a>), the Israelites were warned not to provoke the sons of Esau to war as they passed through Seir on their wilderness travels (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:1-Deut2:8\">Dt 2:1–8</a>). During Israel’s occupation of Palestine, they were drawn into a number of battles against the people of Seir. A band of Simeonites destroyed the Amalekites dwelling in Seir and resettled it with their own people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:42\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:42</a>). Jehoshaphat, king of Judah (872–848 BC), gained an incredible victory over the allied armies of Ammon, Moab, and Seir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:10-2Chr20:23\">2&nbsp;Chr 20:10–23</a>). King Amaziah of Judah (796–767 BC) routed an army from Seir in the valley of Salt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:11-2Chr25:14\">25:11–14</a>). And finally, the prophet Ezekiel pronounced a curse of destruction on the inhabitants of Seir for their antagonism against Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek35:1-Ezek35:15\">Ez 35:1–15</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4112\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Edom, Edomites</span>.</p><p>2. Place defining part of the northern boundary of the land assigned to Judah’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:10\">Jos 15:10</a>). It was positioned west of Kiriath-jearim and northeast of Beth-shemesh. Mt Seir is perhaps the ridge on which the modern town of Saris is built.</p>",
