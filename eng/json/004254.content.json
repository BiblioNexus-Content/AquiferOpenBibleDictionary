This procedure was used when a husband suspected his wife of adultery but had no proof. The process worked like this:</p><p>The husband would bring his wife to the priest along with a grain offering. The wife had to take an oath before God. Then she had to drink &quot;bitter&quot; water that was mixed with dust taken from the tabernacle floor. As the woman drank this water, the priest would offer the jealousy offering to God.</p><p>If the woman was guilty of adultery, her body would react badly and “her <span>belly will swell, her thigh will shrivel</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:27\">Numbers 5:27</a>). She would also become cursed among the people. If she was innocent of adultery, nothing bad would happen to her body.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3429\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bitterness or Jealousy, Water of</span>.</p>",
