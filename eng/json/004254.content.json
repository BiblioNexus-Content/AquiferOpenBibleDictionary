    "content": "<h1>ORDAIN, ORDINATION</h1><p><span>The act of officially giving someone religious authority. Other words for this are “appoint,“ “institute,” “make,” and “establish.” Today, we use “ordain” and “ordination” to mean choosing and appointing people to serve God.</span></p><h2>Ordination in the Old Testament</h2><p>Throughout the Old Testament, God chose who he wanted to serve him. The role of priests first belonged to the head of each family. Later, God chose the tribe of Levi to be priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:8-Deut33:11\">Deuteronomy 33:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:13\">Judges 17:13</a>). Even as different family groups competed for power (like the Zadokites, Aaronites, and Hasmoneans), they all claimed this special role passed down in their families. Divine appointment through Levi was traced back to Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:14\">Exodus 4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:41\">28:41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod29:9\">29:9</a>). This special role was also claimed for Samuel, who was from the tribe of Ephraim, not Levi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:28\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:28</a>). This idea was still celebrated in later writings like Sirach, which was written around 180 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Sir45:6-Sir45:22\">Sirach 45:6–22</a>). The book of Hebrews explains that no one chooses this honor for himself. As it says in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb5:1,Heb5:4\">Hebrews 5:1 and 4</a>, a person is “called by God, just as Aaron was.” This means they are born into a family with this special role.</p><p>The first Levites were presented at the tabernacle (a special tent used for worship) in front of all the people. The people acknowledged them as priests by placing their hands on them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num8:10,Num8:14-Num8:18\">Numbers 8:10, 14–18</a>). Similarly, God gave Moses instructions for a week-long ceremony to make Aaron and his sons priests. This ceremony involved many sacrifices, special clothing, anointing with oil, and other rituals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod29:1-Exod29:46\">Exodus 29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev8:1-Lev8:36\">Leviticus 8</a>). The Bible carefully preserves the details of these ceremonies. This suggests that people continued to use these ceremonies, at least in some form, for many years afterwards. However, the Bible does not record these ceremonies being repeated.</p><p>Along with priests, there were also groups of recognized prophets or communities of prophets. Sometimes these groups had support from kings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:5\">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9-1Kgs1:10\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:17-1Kgs18:19\">18:17–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:35\">20:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:5-1Kgs22:28\">22:5–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:3-2Kgs2:7\">2&nbsp;Kings 2:3–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:2\">23:2</a>). People traced the history of prophecy back to very early times (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:7\">Genesis 20:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:10\">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:4\">Judges 4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer7:25\">Jeremiah 7:25</a>). The phrase “sons of the prophets,” and a hint in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer35:4\">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, may suggest that the role of prophet, like that of priest, sometimes passed from parent to child. However, we do not know exactly how prophets were chosen or installed in their role.</p><p>The most important prophets often disagreed with these prophet groups or “schools” (Elijah in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1-1Kgs17:24\">1&nbsp;Kings 17</a>; Micaiah in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:5-1Kgs22:28\">1&nbsp;Kings 22:5–28</a>; Jeremiah in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer27:14-Jer27:16\">Jeremiah 27:14–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17\">28</a>). God called these major prophets directly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1\">1&nbsp;Kings 17:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:17\">21:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13\">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer1:1-Jer1:19\">Jeremiah 1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos7:15\">Amos 7:15</a>). The only exception was Elisha, whom God told Elijah to call and anoint as a prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:16\">1&nbsp;Kings 19:16</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:1\">Isaiah 61:1</a>). People knew a prophet was genuine not because of any special ceremony, but because their message was clearly true. For prophecies about the future, people could tell a true prophet when their predictions came true (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:13-1Kgs22:14,1Kgs22:26-1Kgs22:28\">1&nbsp;Kings 22:13–14, 26–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer28:5-Jer28:9\">Jeremiah 28:5–9</a>).</p><h2>Ordination in the New Testament</h2><p>Christian ordination (the process of making someone a leader in the church) is also based on God&apos;s choice. Jesus and his disciples were not from the professional religious groups of their time. When Jesus chose his 12 apostles, he called those he wanted. He later told them, “<span>You did not choose Me, but I chose you.</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:16\">John 15:16</a>). </p><p>In the early Christian church, leaders were chosen in various ways, but always with the understanding that God was guiding the process. For example:</p><ul><li><p>When the apostles chose Matthias to replace Judas, they prayed and used a special method (casting lots) to determine God&apos;s will (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:24-Acts1:26\">Acts 1:24–26</a>). </p></li><li><p>Paul said that God had chosen him to be an apostle before he was born. He insisted that he did not receive this role from any person (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:1,Gal1:15\">Galatians 1:1, 15</a>). </p></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit directed the church to send out Paul and Barnabas as missionaries, probably through a message from a Christian prophet. </p></li><li><p>Timothy was first chosen to be Paul&apos;s assistant because of prophetic messages that pointed to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:18\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14\">4:14</a>).</p></li></ul><p>In the church at Corinth, different roles such as speaking, teaching, healing, and administration were given directly by the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor12:8-1Cor12:11,1Cor12:28\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:8–11, 28</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:11\">Ephesians 4:11</a>). </p><p>In Ephesus, the Holy Spirit made the church leaders (“overseers“) guardians of the congregation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:28\">Acts 20:28</a>). </p><p>Throughout these examples, it is clear that God chooses who serves in these roles. The Bible strongly condemns any attempt to get these roles through personal efforts or improper means (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:18-Acts8:24\">Acts 8:18–24</a>).</p><p>On the other hand, the church also played a role in choosing leaders:</p><ul><li><p>The gathered church “nominated” (or suggested) Barsabbas and Matthias as candidates before asking God to make the final choice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:15,Acts1:23\">Acts 1:15, 23</a>). </p></li><li><p>The believers selected seven people to serve, then presented them to the apostles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:2-Acts6:6\">Acts 6:2–6</a>). </p></li><li><p>A gathered church, following the Holy Spirit&apos;s instruction, sent out Paul and Barnabas as missionaries (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:3\">Acts 13:3</a>). </p></li><li><p>Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in various places (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:23\">Acts 14:23</a>). Titus was instructed to do the same (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:5\">Titus 1:5</a>), and Timothy probably did this as well (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim5:22\">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:22</a>). </p></li><li><p>The elders in Lystra and Iconium, along with Paul, appointed Timothy as a leader. They did this in response to a message from a Christian prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6\">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:6</a>). </p></li></ul><p>By the time Paul wrote letters to Timothy and Titus, there were detailed lists of qualities required for church leaders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:13\">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:2\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:2</a>).</p><p>The gathering of believers also participated in choosing leaders. They did this in several ways:</p><ul><li><p>Leaders could be chosen through prayer, fasting (going without food for spiritual purposes), and casting lots (a method of making a random choice believed to reveal God&apos;s will; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:26\">Acts 1:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:6\">6:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:2-Acts13:3\">13:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:23\">14:23</a>).</p></li><li><p>Sometimes leaders were chosen by a “selection by hands” (in Greek, <em>cheirotonein</em>). This word originally meant “election by raising hands,” but was used later to mean “selection by pointing to” (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:23\">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:19\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:19</a>).</p></li><li><p>Sometimes leaders were chosen by group choice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:15,Acts1:23\">Acts 1:15, 23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:2-Acts6:5\">6:2–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:3\">13:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:2\">16:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:14</a>).</p></li></ul><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4459\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Foreordination</span>.</p>",
