The region of Phoenicia was located in the Roman province of Syria. </p><p>It is unclear why Mark specified Syrophoenicia as her homeland. Another North African province was called Libyaphoenicia. This could have been a potential cause of confusion. In a parallel passage, this woman is identified as a Canaanite. Phoenicians referred to themselves as Canaanites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:22\">Matthew 15:22</a>).</p>",
