    "content": "<h1>ATTALUS</h1><p>The name or title of several kings of Pergamum. Attalus II Philadelphus, the king from 159 to 138 BC, probably received a “letter of recommendation” for the Jews from the Roman consul Lucius (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:22\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:22</a>). This Attalus was succeeded by his nephew Philometor Evergetes, who reigned from 138 to 133 BC. Philometor gave his kingdom to Rome, ending the history of Pergamum as a political entity. Rome organized the kingdom into the province of Asia.</p>",
