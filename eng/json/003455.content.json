    "content": "<h1>LEES*</h1><p>Thick substance, or dregs, that forms at the bottom of a wine container as fermentation takes place.</p><p>The term appears in three different situations in the OT, each apparently representing a particular phase of&nbsp;fermentation. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa25:6\">Isaiah 25:6</a> refers to wine at its best (“well-aged,” nlt) after a proper fermentation: strong, clear, and filtered. “Wines on the lees” in context refers to the blessings of peace and plenty that God’s people will enjoy in the age to come. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:11\">Jeremiah 48:11</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph1:12\">Zephaniah 1:12</a> refer to wine that is overfermented, having become syrupy in appearance and weak and bland in&nbsp;taste. Figuratively, the term applies to the Jews and Moabites about to receive impending judgment for having allowed themselves to be lulled into an ungodly indolent and indifferent life style. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps75:8\">Psalm 75:8</a> uses “dregs” to refer to the bitter sediments and grounds left after the wine has been poured out, which the ungodly will be forced to consume.</p>",
