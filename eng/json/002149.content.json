Gehazi took Elisha’s staff to use in reviving the woman’s dead son, but he was unsuccessful (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:31\">31</a>), and the prophet himself had to revive the child (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:32-2Kgs4:37\">32–37</a>). His greed in securing from Naaman presents declined by Elisha resulted in his contracting Naaman’s leprosy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:20-2Kgs5:23,2Kgs5:27\">5:20–23, 27</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:1-2Kgs8:6\">2&nbsp;Kings 8:1–6</a> Gehazi again encountered the Shunammite woman as she was petitioning the king of Israel.</p>",
