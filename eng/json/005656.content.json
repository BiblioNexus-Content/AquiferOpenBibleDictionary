    "content": "<h1>TRACHONITIS, TRACONITIS</h1><p>One of the five Roman provinces east of the Jordan River. The other Roman provinces east of the Jordan River were Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, and Iturea. This region, which may have included parts of Gaulanitis, Batanea, and Auranitis, was part of the tetrarchy ruled by Philip, the brother of Herod (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:1\">Luke 3:1</a>). Traconitis was a barren area located northeast of the Sea of Galilee. In Aramaic, it was known as <em>Argob</em>, meaning “heap of stones,” which described the rough and rocky terrain.</p><p>Aside from the reference in Luke, Traconitis is rarely mentioned in historical records. The Jewish historian Josephus suggests that Uz, the son of Aram (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:23\">Genesis 10:23</a>), colonized the area. The Romans took control of Traconitis when Augustus defeated a local robber-chief, Zenodorus. He then gave the land to Herod the Great, on the condition that he suppress the bandits. After Herod&apos;s death, his son Philip inherited the land but likely only had control over it in name.</p><p>Today, the region is called <em>el-Lejah </em>and is located in southern Syria and northern Jordan.</p>",
