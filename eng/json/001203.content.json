    "content": "<h1>CENTURION</h1><p>A centurion was a leader in the Roman army who commanded 100 soldiers. The Roman army organized its soldiers into groups. Each large unit (called a legion) had 10 groups of 1,000 soldiers. Each group had six centurions who reported to senior officers called tribunes. For example, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:26\">Acts 22:26</a>, a centurion asked his officer what to do about Paul. Centurions had a lot of power because they worked directly with the soldiers. They went to battles with them and made quick choices based on what was happening. </p><p>Being a centurion was often the highest position a normal soldier could reach. Many centurions started as regular soldiers and moved up because of their experience. After becoming a centurion, they could get even better jobs by moving to more important positions. The best job was being the main centurion of the first group of 1000 soldiers in a legion. This meant centurions often moved around the Roman Empire.</p><p>Centurions had many jobs besides keeping soldiers in line. They were in charge of death sentences (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:54\">Matthew 27:54</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:39,Mark15:44-Mark15:45\">Mark 15:39, 44–45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:47\">Luke 23:47</a>). They were in charge of their soldiers all the time, whether the soldiers were Romans or hired from other places. Being a centurion was respected and paid well. Most people who became centurions stayed in that job for a long time.</p><p>The New Testament talks about six centurions. At least two of them seem to have become followers of Christ.</p><ol><li><p>A centurion at Capernaum asked Jesus to save his dying servant. He believed that illnesses would listen to Jesus just like his soldiers listened to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13\">Matthew 8:5–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:2-Luke7:10\">Luke 7:2–10</a>). Even though he was important, he was humble and knew he needed help. He cared for his servant. Jesus was amazed by his faith and healed the sick man.</p></li><li><p>The centurion in charge of the group that killed Jesus said, “<span>Truly this man was the Son of God!</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:39\">Mark 15:39</a>) and “<span>Surely this was a righteous man.</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:47\">Luke 23:47</a>). The apocryphal Acts of Pilate, likely from the fourth century, called this centurion Longinus. Roman Catholics think of him as a saint. There is a stone statue of him in Saint Peter&apos;s Basilica in Rome by the 17th-century artist Giovanni Bernini.</p></li><li><p>A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius became a follower of Jesus after Peter told him about the gospel. Peter did not want to share the gospel with non-Jews at first, but God showed him a vision that changed his mind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48\">Acts 10</a>).</p></li><li><p>A centurion in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:25-Acts22:26\">Acts 22:25–26</a> helped save Paul from being beaten when he told his higher officer that Paul was a Roman citizen.</p></li><li><p>Another centurion helped save Paul from Jews who wanted to kill him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:17-Acts23:22\">Acts 23:17–22</a>).</p></li><li><p>A centurion named Julius had to guard Paul on his trip from Caesarea to Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:1\">Acts 27:1</a>). When their ship broke in a storm, Julius stopped the soldiers from killing all the prisoners, including Paul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:42-Acts27:43\">Acts 27:42–43</a>).</p></li></ol><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8197\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Warfare</span>.</p>",
