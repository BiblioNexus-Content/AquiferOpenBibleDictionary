    "content": "<h1>MANGER</h1><p>A manger is a trough or container where food is placed for farm animals.</p><h2>What Does &quot;Manger&quot; Mean in the Bible?</h2><p>The Greek term for &quot;manger&quot; appears only four times in the New Testament. Three of these instances are in the story of Jesus&apos;s birth in Luke&apos;s Gospel and are translated with the English word &quot;manger&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:7,Luke2:12,Luke2:16\">Luke 2:7, 12, 16</a>). The fourth time the word appears is also in Luke’s Gospel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:15\">13:15</a>). In this verse, some Bible translations use the word &quot;manger&quot; while others use the word &quot;stall.&quot;</p><p>In the Old Testament, several Hebrew words are used to describe places where animals eat and live. We find similar words in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job39:9\">Job 39:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov14:4\">Proverbs 14:4</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:3\">Isaiah 1:3</a>, where they are translated as &quot;crib&quot; or &quot;stall.&quot; When the Old Testament was translated into Greek (a translation called the &quot;Septuagint&quot;), these words were translated using the same Greek word that means &quot;manger.&quot; The Greek translators also used this word to translate three other Hebrew terms:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;a stall (an enclosed area for animals) in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr32:28\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:28</a></p></li><li><p>“fodder” or “mash” (a place where animals eat) in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job6:5\">Job 6:5</a></p></li><li><p>“stalls” or “pens” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab3:17\">Habakkuk 3:17</a></p></li></ul><h2>Where Was The Manger Located?</h2><p>A study of modern Middle Eastern customs and biblical archaeology found two possible locations for the stable and manger: </p><ol><li><p>Inside the house: Poor families often had a room for their animals next to their living space. This animal room was usually a few steps lower than where the family lived. In this type of stable, the manger was made of stone. It was either: </p><ul><li><p>built against one of the wooden walls, or</p></li><li><p>carved out of natural rock.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>In a cave: The stable could also have been in a cave. These caves were either: </p><ul><li><p>near the house, or</p></li><li><p>under the family&apos;s living space.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>Researchers have found examples of these types of stables. In an ancient city called Megiddo, they found a stable room attached to a house. In another ancient city called Lachish, they found a cave under a building that was used as a stable around 1200 BC.</p><p>According to tradition, Jesus was born in a cave that was used as a stable. Today, there is a church called the &quot;Church of the Nativity&quot; that was built over a cave in Bethlehem where some believe Jesus was born. However, when we read Luke&apos;s Gospel, the description could also mean Jesus was born in a stable next to a house, like the ones we described earlier.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5521\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of</span>.</p>",
