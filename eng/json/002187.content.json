    "content": "<h1>GIANTS</h1><p>The word <em>giants</em> is used in English Bibles to translate four different Hebrew words.</p><p>One Hebrew word appears in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job16:14\">Job 16:14.</a> The King James Version says “giant,” but the Revised Standard Version says “warrior.”</p><p>Another Hebrew word is used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:4\">Genesis 6:4</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:33\">Numbers 13:33</a>. Some translations say “giants,” while others say “Nephilim.” The word <em>Nephilim</em> is a Hebrew word that is not translated but simply spelled out using English letters. The exact meaning of <em>Nephilim</em> is unknown. It seems to refer to a group or race of people. Some people think they were very tall or strong, but the Bible does not say this clearly.</p><p>None of the Hebrew words translated as “giants” actually mean “giant.” So we cannot be sure that these people were very large.</p><p>In several passages, says “giants,” but the Revised Standard Version uses the Hebrew word <em>Rephaim</em> (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:20\">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:11\">3:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:4\">Joshua 12:4</a>). The word <em>Rephaim</em> usually appears in its plural form. It refers to several groups of people who lived in the land of Canaan. These groups may have been very tall or large in size.</p><p>They include:</p><ul><li><p>The Anakim, who lived in the hill country of Judah near Hebron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:11\">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Emim of Moab (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:10\">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Zamzummim of Ammon (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:20\">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>)</p></li><li><p>The people of Bashan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:11\">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>)</p></li></ul><p>The word <em>Rephaim</em> also appears in the book of Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:4\">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:12\">13:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:8\">15:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh17:15\">17:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:16\">18:16</a>). </p><p>Some interpreters believe these were the original people who lived in the land before the Canaanites, Philistines, Israelites, and others arrived. They say these were different tribes made up of tall people who were later absorbed into other groups.</p><p>Other interpreters think the <em>Rephaim</em> were not separate tribes. Instead, they think these were just a few very tall people, possibly made that way by a disease, found among many different tribes.</p><p>The Bible does not clearly support either view.</p><p>Another Hebrew word is also translated as “giant” in both the King James Version and New Living Translation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:16-2Sam21:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:16–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr20:4-1Chr20:8\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20:4–8</a>).</p><h2>Famous Giants in the Bible</h2><p>The most well-known giant in the Bible is Goliath of Gath. He was a Philistine soldier who fought against the army of King Saul at the valley of Elah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</a>). The Bible says Goliath was six cubits and a span tall. This means he was between 2.3 to 2.9 meters tall (7.5 and 9.5 feet). His great height caused fear among the Israelite soldiers.</p><p>Goliath challenged the army of Israel. But David, a young shepherd, defeated him. After this, David became well known in Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:5-1Sam18:7\">1 Samuel 18:5–7</a>). The Bible does not call Goliath a “giant.” But his height shows that he was very large. </p><p>Another person known for his great height was King Og of Bashan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:11\">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6524\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Nephilim</span>.</p>",
