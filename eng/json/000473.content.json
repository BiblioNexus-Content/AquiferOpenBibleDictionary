The town’s location is unknown. It may be the same as the hill town of Ramathaim-zophim, the prophet Samuel’s home (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</a>), about 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Luke described the place as a Jewish town, and Joseph was himself a Jewish official (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:50\">Luke 23:50</a>).</p>",
