    "content": "<h1>SIMEON, Tribe of</h1><p>One of the 12 tribes of Israel descended from Jacob’s second son, Simeon. Because of Simeon’s evil deed at Shechem, Jacob predicted that Simeon’s descendants would be spread out among the other tribes of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:7\">Genesis 49:7</a>).</p><h2>The Territory of the Tribe of Simeon</h2><p>According to the book of Joshua, Simeon’s inheritance was included in Judah’s territory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:1,Josh19:9\">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:3\">Judges 1:3</a>&nbsp;suggests a close relationship between the tribes of Simeon and Judah. The two tribes often worked together in their military campaigns during the conquest of Canaan. The Levitical towns, which were allocated to provide for the Levites, were also shared between Simeon and Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:9-Josh21:16\">Joshua 21:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:9-Josh21:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:9-Josh21:16\">16</a>). </p><p>Their limited inheritance within Judah&apos;s borders continued when Simeon joined Judah when the kingdom of Israel split in two. Despite this, the Simeonites managed to maintain a distinct tribal identity for some time. This is evidenced by family lists preserved until the reign of Hezekiah, king of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:42\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:24</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:42\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:42\">42</a>).</p><p>During Hezekiah’s reign, Simeonites expanded their territory by settling in the Arab areas of Seir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:43\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:24</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:43\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24-1Chr4:43\">43</a>). They may have also settled in the hill country of Ephraim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr15:9\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 15:9</a>). Although Simeon was Jacob’s second-oldest son, the tribe of Simeon was never important. Unlike some other tribes, Simeon did not produce any notable judges, and it is conspicuously absent from the Song of Deborah (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 5</a>). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:28-1Chr4:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:28</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:28-1Chr4:33\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:28-1Chr4:33\">33</a>, Simeon’s tribe settled in the southernmost part of Canaan, a region known as the Negev. This area, although dry and rugged, was fertile enough in early summer due to yearly rainfall and persistent springs. The region became known as &quot;the Negev of Judah,&quot; which serves to distinguish Simeon from non-Jews living in that area (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:10\">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:14\">30:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:7\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:7</a>).</p><h2>Intermarriage in the Tribe of Simeon</h2><p>The family lists of Simeon reveal a lot of intermarriage with other Israelite tribes and with non-Israelites: </p><ul><li><p>Shaul, Simeon’s son, was the son of a Canaanite woman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:10\">Genesis 46:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:15\">Exodus 6:15</a>).</p></li><li><p>Two of Simeon’s sons share names with Ishmael’s sons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:14\">Genesis 25:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:14\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:14\">14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:29-1Chr1:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:29</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:29-1Chr1:30\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:29-1Chr1:30\">30</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:25\"> 4:25</a>).</p></li><li><p>Jamin was a descendant of Ram (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:10\">Genesis 46:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:15\">Exodus 6:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:27\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:27</a>).</p></li></ul><h2>The Tribe of Simeon in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, the tribe of Simeon appears seventh in the list of the tribes who are sealed by God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:7\">Revelation 7:7</a>).</p>",
