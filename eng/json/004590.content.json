(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:19\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr5:26\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26</a>). The meaning of the name is unknown, and Assyrian manuscripts do not mention it. Some scholars suggest that Pul was the original name of Tiglath-pileser. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8005\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Tiglath-pileser</span>.</p></li><li><p>An African people mentioned only in the King James Version of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:19\">Isaiah 66:19</a>. Their connection with Tarshish and Lud gives strong support that “Pul” is a copyist error for <span>“</span>Put<span>”</span> (as in various Greek manuscripts). They were a people related to the Egyptians and could be a subculture of Libyans. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7039\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Put (Place)</span>.</p></li></ol>",
