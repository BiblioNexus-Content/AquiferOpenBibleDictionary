    "content": "<h1>WORMWOOD</h1><p>Wormwood is a general name for a group of woody plants with a strong aromatic smell. These plants have a strong, bitter taste. The young shoots and branch tips of wormwood plants are used to make the &quot;wormwood&quot; product sold in markets. Because of its bitter taste, wormwood is often mentioned alongside gall as a symbol of bitter calamity and sorrow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov5:4\">Proverbs 5:4</a>;  <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer9:15\">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:15\">23:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam3:15,Lam3:19\">Lamentations 3:15, 19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev8:11\">Revelation 8:11</a>). </p><p><em>Artemisia herba-alba</em> is the most common type of wormwood found in the Holy Land today. It has a strong aromatic smell similar to camphor and tastes bitter. Another type, <em>Artemisia judaica</em>, grows only in the Sinai region.</p><p>People make a drink called absinthe from wormwood plants. At first, absinthe causes increased activity and pleasant feelings, and fills the mind with grand ideas (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam3:15\">Lamentations 3:15</a>). However, regular use of absinthe leads to stupor and a gradual decrease in thinking ability. It eventually causes delirium and sometimes death. Wormwood is also mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:12\">Amos 6:12</a>.</p>",
