The seeds are used for seasoning food (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa28:25-Isa28:27\">Isaiah 28:25â€“27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:23\">Matthew 23:23</a>).</p><p>Cumin (<em>Cuminum cyminum</em>) is believed to be native to Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean region. People have grown cumin for a long time to harvest its strongly aromatic and sharp-tasting seeds.</p><p>Cumin seeds are similar to caraway seeds but larger. They do not taste as pleasant as caraway seeds, but were still used widely as a flavor or spice. Sometimes people even mixed cumin with flour when making bread. Besides being used in cooking, people also used cumin as medicine and as a seasoning with fish and meats.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4454\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Food and Food Preparation</span>.</p>",
