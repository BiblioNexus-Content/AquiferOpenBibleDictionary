City identified as Kullani (Kullan Koy), about 20 miles (32.2&nbsp;kilometers) north of Aleppo in northern Syria. This northern identification is hinted at in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:9\">Isaiah 10:9</a>, where Calno is associated with Carchemish, some 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) to the northeast, as well as in the context of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:2\">Amos 6:2</a> (note the north-to-south progressionâ€”Calneh, Hamath, Gath). Canneh in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:23\">Ezekiel 27:23</a> seems to refer to the same general location and is perhaps to be linked with Calneh. Kullani was captured by Tiglath-pileser II, king of Assyria, about 741 BC.</p>",
