    "content": "<h1>MARESHAH (Place)</h1><p>City (Greek Marisa<em>;</em> Josephus, “Marissa”) on the road from the coastal plain of Judah toward Hebron and Jerusalem. Remains of Jewish pottery indicate occupation from at least 800 BC. The site is now called Tel Mareshah.</p><p>At Israel’s occupation of Canaan, Mareshah was allotted by Joshua to Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:44\">Jos 15:44</a>). Later, at the division of the kingdom, Rehoboam fortified it as a protective outpost covering Jerusalem from the southwest, from which many invaders were to approach (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:8\">2&nbsp;Chr 11:8</a>). Zerah the Ethiopian, with a million men and three hundred chariots, penetrated as far as Mareshah and was defeated there by Asa (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr14:9\">14:9</a>). In the following reign, that of Jehoshaphat, the prophet Eliezer, born at Mareshah, foretold the destruction of the proud fleet the king had built (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:37\">20:37</a>).</p><p>The prophet Micah, who was born at Moresheth-gath (a few miles to the north), uttered a moving elegy upon the fate of the regions he knew from boyhood, as the Assyrians approached (whether under Sennacherib, 701 BC, or Sargon, 711 BC). Punning upon each familiar place-name, he warned Mareshah of a coming “possessor” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic1:15\">Mi 1:15</a>).</p>",
