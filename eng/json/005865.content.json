    "content": "<h1>ZAANANNIM</h1><p>One of the markers of the border of Naphtali listed between Heleph and Adami-nekeb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:33\">Jos 19:33</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:11\">Judges 4:11</a> puts it near Kedesh. There Sisera took refuge in the tent of Heber the Kenite and was killed by Jael (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:11-Judg4:21\">11–21</a>). While the precise location is not known, it was west of Lake el-Huleh (modern Merom) in a region that was probably marshy in ancient times. Though the kjv translates the text as “plain of Zaanaim,” it is more likely “Oak of Zaanannim” (rsv, niv, nlt). Since many terebinth trees are located in the region, the text is probably referring to a terebinth set aside as a sacred tree.</p>",
