Other lists of ancestors in 1&nbsp;Chronicles list Ner, instead of Abiel, as Kish’s father and Saul’s grandfather (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:39\">9:39</a>). This confusion is either because of a copyist’s error or because Saul may have had two relatives named Ner, a great-grandfather and an uncle.</p></li><li><p>A warrior among David’s mighty men who were known as “the thirty” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:32\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:32</a>). He is also called Abi-albon the Arbathite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:31\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:31</a>).</p></li></ol>",
