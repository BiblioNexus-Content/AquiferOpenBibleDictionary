    "content": "<h1>GETHSEMANE</h1><p>The place where Jesus and his disciples went after their Last Supper together in the upper room. Jesus experienced deep emotional distress because he knew he would soon be betrayed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:36-Matt26:56\">Matthew 26:36–56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:32-Mark14:50\">Mark 14:32–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:39-Luke22:53\">Luke 22:39–53</a>).</p><p>The name &quot;Gethsemane&quot; appears only in the Gospel of Matthew (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:36\">26:36</a>) and the Gospel of Mark (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:32\">14:32</a>). The name means “oil press.” This tells us there were likely olive trees growing there. The Gospels describe Gethsemane as a “place,” suggesting it had a fence or wall around it. It may be that this place was owned by someone. If so, Jesus and his disciples may have had special permission to enter.</p><p>Luke and John do not use the word &quot;Gethsemane&quot; in their Gospels, but they both describe Jesus&apos;s suffering before he was betrayed. Luke says this happened on the &quot;Mount of Olives&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:39\">Luke 22:39</a>). John says it was “across the Kidron Valley” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:1\">John 18:1</a>). John is the only one who calls it a garden. These Gospels also tell us that Jesus and his disciples often met there to pray together (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:39\">Luke 22:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:2\">John 18:2</a>). The Gospel stories suggest the garden was large enough for the group to separate into smaller groups.</p>",
