The King James Version translates it as pulse. Not wishing to eat the kingâ€™s unclean food, Daniel and his friends requested permission to live on a diet of vegetables and water. The Hebrew word translated as &quot;vegetable&quot; literally means &quot;things sown&quot; and probably includes any kind of seed that can be eaten. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6929\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Plants</span>.</p>",
