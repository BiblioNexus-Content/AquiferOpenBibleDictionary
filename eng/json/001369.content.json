    "content": "<h1>COMMANDMENT, The New</h1><p>The New Commandment is Christ’s instruction for Christians to love one another. The term “new commandment” appears four times in the New Testament, all in the writings of John (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:7\">1&nbsp;John 2:7, 8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2John1:5\">2&nbsp;John 1:5</a>). Jesus first gave this command to his disciples on the night he was arrested: “<span>A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>). This command appears in other places in the Bible (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:12\">John 15:12, 17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:8\">Romans 13:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:22\">1&nbsp;Peter 1:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:11\">1&nbsp;John 3:11, 23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:7\">4:7, 11–12</a>), but it is not called “new” in those passages.</p><h2>Love as a Commandment</h2><p>Jesus had already told his disciples to love their enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:45\">Matthew 5:43–45</a>) and to love their neighbors as themselves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37\">Luke 10:25–37</a>). The “new commandment” focused on Christians loving each other. It did not replace the other two love commands. Jesus intended this command to create a strong and convincing testimony for those outside the church. It would show that: </p><ol><li><p>His followers loved one another in a Christlike way.</p></li><li><p>True community can be found “in Christ.”</p></li><li><p>What Jesus said about himself and his mission was true (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:35\">John 13:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23\">17:21–23</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Jesus used the same word for “commandment” that described the Old Testament law, giving his new commandment the same authority. The Old Testament law also included commands to love (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:18\">Leviticus 19:18, 34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut10:19\">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>). The apostle Paul referred to love as the “law of Christ” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:2\">Galatians 6:2</a>), and James called the love command the “royal law” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:8\">James 2:8</a>) and “the perfect law of liberty” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:25\">1:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:12\">2:12</a>).</p><p>The word “commandment” had another meaning as well. Many Jews in Jesus’s time wrongly thought that obeying commandments would make them worthy of God’s blessing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:3\">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:2\">Galatians 3:2</a>). <span>However, Jesus made it clear that love follows from God&apos;s blessing. It is not a requirement to earn it</span>. For Jesus, the commandment showed how the blessed should behave. Disciples were commanded to love in the same way that branches are “commanded” to bear fruit: by staying connected to the vine (Jesus), Christians can love (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:4\">John 15:4</a>).</p><h2>What Made It New?</h2><p>The new commandment gets its special character from the “new covenant” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34\">Jeremiah 31:31–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:20\">Luke 22:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:25</a>), which Jesus established at the Last Supper. Under the new covenant, God “writes” his law on believers’ hearts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:16\">Hebrews 10:16</a>). This means he actively works in them through the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek36:27\">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:3\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3</a>), giving them a new desire to obey him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:4\">Romans 8:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:16\">Galatians 5:16</a>). The new commandment to love is the main part of the new covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:8\">Romans 13:8, 10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:14\">Galatians 5:14</a>). Obedience is therefore a gift, because “<span>love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:7\">1&nbsp;John 4:7</a>). Love is the result of faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:23\">1 John 3:23</a>) and is part of the gospel itself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:11\">1 John 3:11</a>).</p><p>The close connection between the new covenant and the new commandment might explain why the command to love was called “new.” Christ’s coming was the beginning of a new age. John wrote, <span>&quot;The darkness is fading and the true light is already shining</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:8\">1&nbsp;John 2:8</a>). As Jesus prepared to return to heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:33-John13:35\">John 13:33–35</a>), he gave a single commandment. It was to guide his disciples until the Judgment Day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:28-John5:29\">John 5:28–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:17\">1&nbsp;John 4:17</a>). Obeying the new commandment would mark them as Jesus’s disciples during his absence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:35\">John 13:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23\">17:21–23</a>). The command was new because it had a special purpose in this new era.</p><p>What made the era new was that Jesus Christ’s coming revealed God the Father in a way that had never been seen before (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:18\">John 1:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:30\">10:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John17:6-John17:8\">17:6–8</a>). No prophet had ever been able to say, “Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:9\">John 14:9</a>). Therefore, Jesus’s command that his disciples love each other “as I have loved you” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>) <span>was new and shocking by any human standard</span>. No one had ever loved perfectly as Jesus did (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:1\">John 13:1</a>). Following his example of love was a new commandment. The greatness of Jesus’s love led him to “lay down his life for his friends” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:13\">John 15:13</a>). Similarly, John concluded that “we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:16\">1&nbsp;John 3:16</a>). Love means never closing one&apos;s heart to a needy Christian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:17\">1 John 3:17</a>). Instead, it means gladly sacrificing one&apos;s own good for another&apos;s benefit.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3786\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Commandments, The Ten</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5864\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Law, Biblical Concept of</span>.</p>",
