The three, Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, are described as “mighty men among the friends of the king” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:38\">1&nbsp;Macc 3:38</a>). They were commissioned to go into Judah and destroy it but were completely defeated, although they greatly outnumbered the forces of Judas Maccabeus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc4:1-1Macc4:22\">4:1–22</a>). On another occasion Joseph and Azariah were defeated when they disobeyed the orders of Judas and attacked Gorgias at Jamnia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:56-1Macc5:60\">5:56–60</a>). It is probable that Jamnia is the correct reading for Idumea, which is found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc12:32\">2&nbsp;Maccabees 12:32</a>.</p>",
