    "content": "<h1>JEWELRY, JEWELS</h1><p>A decorated accessory. In the Bible, both men and women used jewelry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod11:2\">Exodus 11:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:21\">Isaiah 3:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:21\">21</a>). People gave jewelry as gifts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:22,Gen24:53\">Genesis 24:22, 53</a>). Jewelry was often stolen in war (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:25\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:25</a>). Before coins existed, gold jewelry was a sign of wealth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:3\">2 Chronicles 21:3</a>).</p><h2>Types of Jewelry in the Old Testament</h2><p>The Old Testament mentions many types of jewelry</p><ul><li><p>Arm bracelets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:22,Gen24:30,Gen24:47\">Genesis 24:22, 30, 47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek16:11\">Ezekiel 16:11</a>) </p></li><li><p>Ankle ornaments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:20\">Isaiah 3:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:20\">20</a>)</p></li><li><p>Necklaces (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen41:42\">Genesis 41:42</a>)</p></li><li><p>Crowns (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech9:16\">Zechariah 9:16</a>)</p></li><li><p>Earrings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:22\">Genesis 24:22</a>)</p></li><li><p>Nose rings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:21\">Isaiah 3:21</a>)</p></li><li><p>Finger rings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen41:42\">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth3:10\">Esther 3:10</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Gold or silver bases were used to hold precious stones in these items. The precious stones were rounded, polished, and sometimes engraved (carved, etched, or inscribed into a material). Many stones considered precious back then would not be valued as precious today. Instead, they would be considered semiprecious (less rare or valuable than precious stones).</p><p>Semiprecious stones were added to necklaces and other pieces of jewelry. Ancient royal headdresses from the graves at Ur show the skill of jewelers from the period. Hairbands and pins were often used to decorate hair, and many have been found. Rings with carved stones were extremely popular, as well as nose rings (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:47\">Genesis 24:47</a>). Fine gold chains were often worn. Signet rings and heavy gold chains were symbols of office (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen41:42\">Genesis 41:42</a>). Bracelets and amulets were worn around the wrist, the upper arm, and the neck. Decorative pins, similar to the modern safety pin, were often used to hold clothing together.</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:23\">Isaiah 3:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:18-Isa3:23\">23</a> gives a detailed description of women&apos;s jewelry and clothing. The prophet warns: “The Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents; their pendants, bracelets, and veils; their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms; their signet rings and nose rings; their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses; and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.”</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6313\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Minerals and Metals</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7796\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Stones, Precious</span>.</p>",
