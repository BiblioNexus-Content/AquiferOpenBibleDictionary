Some people think she came from a small city called Shunem in ancient Israel. Her name, &quot;Shunammite,&quot; sounds a lot like Solomon&apos;s name in Hebrew, which might be why she is called Shulammite instead of Shunammite.</p><p>Shunem was a city in the land of Issachar near Mount Gilboa (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam28:4\">1&nbsp;Samuel 28:4</a>). The city was famous for one story about a beautiful young woman named Abishag. She was called from Shunem to take care of King David in his later years (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:4,1Kgs1:15\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:1–4, 15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:17-1Kgs2:22\">2:17–22</a>). Some people think Abishag might be the same woman as the Shulammite in Solomon&apos;s love poem.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7631\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Shunem</span>.</p>",
