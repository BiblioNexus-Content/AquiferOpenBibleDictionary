Much of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt5:1-Jdt5:24\">chapter 5</a> describes Achior’s version of Israel&apos;s history. It ends with his warning to Holofernes that God would protect Israel. When he said this, the hearers threatened to tear him apart. </p><p>Holofernes then sent Achior over to the Israelites, and Uzziah treated him well (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt6:1-Jdt6:21\">Judith 6</a>). After Holofernes’s death, Achior went to see the Assyrian general’s severed head. When he saw this, he threw himself at the feet of Judith, praising her. He recognized the powerful works of God, was circumcised (which is a religious ceremony for men joining the Jewish faith), and became a permanent member of the Israelite community (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt14:6-Jdt14:10\">Judith 14:6</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt14:6-Jdt14:10\">10</a>).</p>",
