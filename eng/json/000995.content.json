This plant is sometimes called black cumin, black caraway, or nutmeg flower. This annual plant belongs to the buttercup family (<em>Ranunculaceae</em>). It grows wild in southern Europe, Syria, Egypt, North Africa, and other Mediterranean regions, and is cultivated for its flavorful seeds.</p><p>The black seeds have a spicy, pepper-like taste and aroma. People in Eastern countries sprinkle them over breads and cakes, and use them to flavor curries and other dishes, both historically and today.</p><p>Farmers in Israel and the surrounding areas still harvest cumin and Nigella using the gentle methods that Isaiah described, showing how traditional agricultural practices have remained largely unchanged.</p>",
