Lamech’s song (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:23-Gen4:24\">Genesis 4:23–24</a>) is an early example of Hebrew poetry. In this song, Lamech boasts about killing a man who had wounded him, comparing his act of vengeance to Cain’s murder of Abel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:8-Gen4:12\">Genesis 4:8–12</a>). He asserts that “<span>If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.</span>” Lamech’s song shows how as civilization grew, so did pride and violence. This contrasts sharply with Jesus&apos; teaching on forgiveness, where he advises forgiving “seventy times seven” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:22\">Matthew 18:22</a>).</p></li><li><p>Methuselah’s son, and the father of Noah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen5:25-Gen5:31\">Genesis 5:25–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:3\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:3</a>). When Noah was born, Lamech hoped that the child would bring relief to humanity from the curse placed upon Adam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen5:29\">Genesis 5:29</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:17\">Genesis 3:17</a>). He lived for 777 years, one of the longest lives among those who lived before the Flood. The Dead Sea Scrolls contained long conversations between Lamech and his father, Methuselah. Lamech is listed as an ancestor of Jesus in the family list recorded in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:36\">Luke 3:36</a>.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4580\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Genealogy of Jesus Christ</span>.</p></li></ol>",
