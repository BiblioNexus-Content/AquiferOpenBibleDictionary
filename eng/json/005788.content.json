Watchtowers were also built in the vineyards of Palestine. </p><p>Watchmen assigned to towers oversaw vineyards, protecting them from wild animals and thieves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:2\">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:33\">Matthew 21:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:1\">Mark 12:1</a>). Watchtower structures are still used in Palestine. Some of the tower buildings also serve as living quarters for the vineyard workers.</p><p>Some watchtowers, like the tower of Eder in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:21\">Genesis 35:21</a>, were built in wilderness areas. They provided a protected shelter for shepherds to watch their flocks. Some towers were fortified outposts for watchmen to guard a city by protecting trade traffic from thieves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:8\">2&nbsp;Kings 18:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:24\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa32:14\">Isaiah 32:14</a>).</p>",
