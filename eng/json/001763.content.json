While in Moab, he died; then his sons also died; and Naomi decided to return to Judah. One daughter-in-law, Orpah, preferred to remain in Moab; the other, Ruth, chose to accompany Naomi. Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, bought Elimelech’s land and married Ruth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:9-Ruth4:10\">4:9–10</a>). From this union came a great-grandson, David, and the royal line in which the Messiah would eventually be born. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7243\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Ruth, Book of</span>.</p>",
