Because Zelophehad had no sons, his daughters asked Moses to give them the inheritance of their father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:1\">27:1</a>). Moses made a ruling that daughters should receive the inheritance in such cases. But, the daughters must marry men from within their own tribe so that the tribal allotments would remain unchanged (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:7\">Numbers 27:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num36:2\">36:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh17:3\">Joshua 17:3</a>).</p>",
