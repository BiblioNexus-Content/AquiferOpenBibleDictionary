He was the sixth and last son of Jacob and Leah. She named him Zebulun, meaning &quot;abode, dwelling.&quot; She said, &quot;<span>This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:20\">Genesis 30:20</a>). Later, he settled his family in Egypt with Jacob and his brothers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:3\">Exodus 1:3</a>). </p><p>Jacob prophesied that Zebulun&apos;s descendants would live on the coast, with their border touching Sidon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:13\">Genesis 49:13</a>). Zebulun&apos;s tribe was between Asher&apos;s and Naphtali&apos;s tribes. Asher&apos;s was by the Mediterranean, and Naphtali&apos;s was by the Sea of Galilee. Despite this, Zebulun prospered in trade with the Canaanite coastal cities. Zebulun fathered three sons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:14\">Genesis 46:14</a>) and founded one of Israel’s 12 tribes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:30-Num1:31\">Numbers 1:30–31</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8332\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Zebulun, Tribe of</span>.</p>",
