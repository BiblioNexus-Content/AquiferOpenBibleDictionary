    "content": "<h1>LINTEL (Top of a Doorframe)</h1><p>A lintel is a horizontal beam placed above a doorway. It sits on top of the vertical supports called &quot;doorposts.&quot; Some Bible translations use the term &quot;lintel&quot; while many modern translations often use more familiar terms like &quot;top of the doorframe.&quot;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51\">Exodus 12</a>, the Israelites must prepare for the tenth plague, death, and for the first Passover. After killing a lamb, the people were to take the blood and “<span>put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:7\">Exodus 12:7</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:31\">First Kings 6:31</a> describes Solomon’s building of the temple. The King James Version says, “He made doors of olive tree: the&nbsp;lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.” The meaning of this verse in the Hebrew is a little difficult to determine. The New American Standard Bible translates it as “the lintel and five-sided doorposts.” The New English Bible replaces the word “lintel” with “pilasters.” The Berean Standard Bible translates it as &quot;doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.&quot; It is possible that the top of the doorway was slanted, formed by beams leaning toward each other (like an arch) instead of one horizontal beam.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:1\">Amos 9:1</a>&nbsp;the King James Version has “lintel,” whereas the Revised Standard Version has “capital.” The Berean Standard Bible simply has &quot;tops of the pillars.&quot; The Hebrew word here seems to mean the top part of a column. The same is true in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:14\">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, where the King James Version has “lintels” and the Berean Standard Bible has “atop her pillars.” </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2888\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Architecture</span>.</p>",
