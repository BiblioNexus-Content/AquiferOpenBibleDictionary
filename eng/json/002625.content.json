Zelophehad was from the tribe of Manasseh. He had no sons, so his inheritance passed to his daughters. They married within their own tribe as God commanded. So their land remained in the tribe of the family of their father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num36:11-Num36:12\">Numbers 36:11â€“12</a>).</p>",
