    "content": "<h1>HAND</h1><p>The part of the arm at its end that can hold and move things. We use our hands to pick up objects, write, work, and make gestures. The word &quot;hand&quot; appears hundreds of times in the Bible. Sometimes it refers to the actual body part. Other times, it is used as a way to explain ideas or feelings through comparison.</p><h2>Symbolic Meanings of Hands</h2><p>In the Bible, people often used the word &quot;hand&quot; to explain different ideas. When someone had strong hands, it showed they had power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:15\">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps31:5\">Psalm 31:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:62\">Mark 14:62</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh8:20\">Joshua 8:20,</a> &quot;they <span>could not escape&quot; is described as they had no </span>“hand to flee” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps76:5\">Psalm 76:5</a>). Weak or limp hands showed that someone was powerless or uncertain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa35:3\">Isaiah 35:3</a>)</p><p>The position or use of hands also had special meanings. When two people shook hands, it showed they were friends (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:15\">2&nbsp;Kings 10:15</a>). If someone sat at a ruler&apos;s right hand, it meant they were honored and favored (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps16:11\">Psalms 16:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps77:10\">77:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1\">110:1</a>). Clean hands meant someone was innocent of wrongdoing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps26:6\">Psalm 26:6</a>). When people shook hands to make a deal, it showed the deal was official (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov6:1\">Proverbs 6:1</a>). Raising one&apos;s hand against someone meant they intended to hurt that person (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:26\">1&nbsp;Kings 11:26</a>).</p><p>People also used their hands in worship. They raised their hands when they prayed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:11\">Exodus 17:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev9:22\">Leviticus 9:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:15\">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim2:8\">1&nbsp;Timothy 2:8</a>). People used their hands when they made promises to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:22\">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:2\">24:2</a>)</p><p>In the Bible, how people used their hands could show different feelings and actions. Someone might use their hands to express:</p><ul><li><p>Risking their life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:3\">Judges 12:3</a>)</p></li><li><p>Showing happiness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:12\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:12</a>)</p></li><li><p>Sharing with others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut15:11\">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>)</p></li><li><p>Showing sadness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam13:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:19</a>)</p></li><li><p>Showing respect (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov30:32\">Proverbs 30:32</a>)</p></li><li><p>Starting an important task (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:62\">Luke 9:62</a>)</p></li></ul><p>When Pontius Pilate washed his hands during Jesus&apos;s trial, he was trying to show he was not responsible for what was happening to Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:24\">Matthew 27:24</a>). However, since Pilate was the governor who had to approve Jesus&apos;s death, washing his hands did not really remove his responsibility.</p><p>When the people of Israel left Egypt, the Bible says they went out &quot;marching out defiantly&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:8\">Exodus 14:8</a>). In the original language, this was written as &quot;with a high hand,&quot; which meant they left boldly and confidently.</p><h2>Hands in Work and Ritual</h2><p>Working with one&apos;s hands was considered honorable (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:28\">Ephesians 4:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:11\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:11</a>). The apostle Paul was proud of the work he did with his hands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:34\">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor4:12\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 4:12</a>). </p><p>The Jewish priests had special rules about washing their hands before they could do their work in the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:19-Exod30:21\">Exodus 30:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:30-Exod40:32\">40:30–32</a>). Later, some religious leaders (the scribes and Pharisees) made these rules too strict. Jesus chose not to follow these strict hand-washing rules to show that they had gone too far (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:20\">Matthew 15:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:38\">Luke 11:38</a>). </p><h2>The Hand of the Lord</h2><p>When the Bible talks about &quot;the hand of the Lord,&quot; it describes different ways God works with people. It can mean:</p><ul><li><p>God&apos;s unstoppable power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:15\">Deuteronomy 2:15</a>)</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s judgment or decisions about right and wrong (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:11\">Acts 13:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:31\">Hebrews 10:31</a>)</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s guidance given to prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1\">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1\">37:1</a>)</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s protection and care (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:6\">Ezra 7:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:28-John10:29\">John 10:28–29</a>)</p></li></ul><h2>The Laying on of Hands</h2><p>In the Bible, placing hands on someone&apos;s head (called &quot;laying on of hands&quot;) was a very important action that had special meaning. This action appears many times in the Bible in different situations.</p><p>In the Old Testament, when someone brought an animal to be sacrificed, they would place their hands on the animal&apos;s head before it was killed. The priest did not do this. The person bringing the animal did. When people placed their hands on the animal, it showed that their sins were being moved to the animal or that they were identifying themselves with the animal that would die (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:4\">Leviticus 1:4</a>).</p><p>People also placed their hands on others to give them special jobs or roles. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Moses put his hands on Joshua to make him the new leader of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:12-Num27:23\">Numbers 27:12–23</a>)</p></li><li><p>The apostles put their hands on seven helpers they chose for their work (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:5-Acts6:6\">Acts 6:5–6</a>)</p></li><li><p>The church in Antioch put their hands on Paul and Barnabas when they sent them out as missionaries (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:3\">Acts 13:3</a>)</p></li></ul><p>When leaders put their hands on someone, it showed that person was now sharing in their work and authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6\">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:6</a>). This action was always done with prayer. As an early church teacher named Augustine said: &quot;What else is the laying on of hands but a prayer over one?&quot;</p><p>Jesus often put his hands on sick people when he healed them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:5\">Mark 6:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:40\">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:11-Luke13:13\">13:11–13</a>). His followers did the same thing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:18\">Mark 16:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:12,Acts9:17\">Acts 9:12, 17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:8\">28:8</a>). When someone placed their hands on a sick person, it showed several things:</p><ul><li><p>The healer cared about the sick person and wanted to help them.</p></li><li><p>It helped the sick person trust that God would heal them.</p></li><li><p>It showed that God was answering their prayers for healing.</p></li></ul><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7206\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Right Hand</span>.</p>",
