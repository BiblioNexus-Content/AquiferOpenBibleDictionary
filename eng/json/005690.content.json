The rose of Sharon mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:1\">Song of Solomon 2:1</a> may be the mountain tulip (<em>Tulipa montana</em>) or the closely related Sharon tulip (<em>Tulipa</em> <em>sharonensis</em>).</p><p>The mountain tulip is an attractive plant with leaves that often have wavy edges. This species commonly grows in the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and the Anti-Lebanon. As its name suggests, it primarily grows in mountain areas.</p><p>The Sharon tulip grows in sandy places on the Sharon coastal plains.</p>",
