These scholars were called Masoretes. The Masoretes added vowel markings and accents to the text to ensure its accurate pronunciation and interpretation. This text became the standard version of the Hebrew Bible. </p><p>Most modern translations of the Old Testament use it as their main source, often alongside other ancient texts for comparison, such as the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Old Testament) and the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6136\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Masora, Masoretes</span>.</p>",
