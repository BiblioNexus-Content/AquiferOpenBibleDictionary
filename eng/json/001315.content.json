    "content": "<h1>CISTERN</h1><p>Place to store water; a man-made catch basin or reservoir. Stone cisterns plastered with lime came into common use in Palestine in the 13th century BC.</p><p>Leaky or abandoned cisterns were often used as burial, torture, or prison chambers. For example, the dungeon into which the prophet Jeremiah was lowered was an abandoned muddy cistern (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:6\">Jer 38:6</a>). Ishmael threw the bodies of 70 murdered men into a large cistern originally constructed by King Asa for a wartime water supply (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:4-Jer41:9\">41:4–9</a>).</p><p>Cisterns were vitally important in the arid Near East. King Uzziah of Judah is described as hewing out many cisterns in areas where springs or wells were lacking (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:10\">2&nbsp;Chr 26:10</a>). An Assyrian general taunting King Hezekiah and his people promised that, if they would submit, everyone would drink the water of his own cistern (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa36:16\">Is 36:16</a>; cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:31\">2&nbsp;Kgs 18:31</a>). Much earlier, Moses had assured the Israelites that cisterns already hewn out would be among God’s blessing in the Promised Land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:11\">Dt 6:11</a>).</p>",
