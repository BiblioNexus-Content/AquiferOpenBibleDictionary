    "content": "<h1>NAZARENES</h1><p>Nazarenes was name given to those who followed Jesus of Nazareth. Since people knew Jesus as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or &quot;Jesus the Nazarene,&quot; it was easy to transfer that title to his followers. They were “followers of the Nazarene” or “Nazarenes.” </p><p>The earliest use of the term is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:5\">Acts 24:5.</a> Tertullus accused the apostle Paul of being “a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” This was not meant as a compliment.</p><p>The early Christians probably did no use that name for themselves. However, later Jewish-Christian and Gnostic groups (religious groups that emphasized special secret knowledge) did call themselves Nazarenes. One early writing was even called <em>The Gospel of the Nazarenes</em>.</p>",
