    "content": "<h1>CHIMHAM</h1><p>A son of Barzillai, according to the Jewish historian Josephus. Chimham was a very wealthy man who provided King David and his men with food. This happened while they were in Mahanaim when David was escaping from his son Absalom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:32\">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:32</a>). David invited Barzillai to come back with him to Jerusalem. But Barzillai declined this offer. Instead, he asked that David show kindness to Chimham (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:37-2Sam19:40\">37â€“40</a>). David agreed to this request. He later instructed his son Solomon to give Chimham regular support from the palace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:7\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:7</a>). </p><p>His name appears centuries later in a place called <span>Geruth Chimham</span>, which was located near Bethlehem. This is where the people whom Johanan had rescued from Ishmael stayed temporarily before they planned to continue their journey to Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:17\">Jeremiah 41:17</a>).</p><p></p>",
