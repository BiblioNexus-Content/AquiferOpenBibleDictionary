Tola’s son, a Kohathite who was one of the Levitical singers in the time of David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:34\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:34</a>); possibly the same as Eliab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:27\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:27</a>).</p><p>3. Shimei’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:20\">1&nbsp;Chr 8:20</a>).</p><p>4. Shashak’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:22\">1&nbsp;Chr 8:22</a>).</p><p>5. Warrior among David’s mighty men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:46\">1&nbsp;Chr 11:46</a>), called a Mahavite.</p><p>6. Another warrior among David’s mighty men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:47\">1&nbsp;Chr 11:47</a>).</p><p>7. Warrior from the Gadites who joined David at Ziklag in his struggle against King Saul. Eliel was one of those experts with a shield and spear. Whether the Eliel of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:11\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:11</a> should be equated with either of the two Eliels of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:46-1Chr11:47\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:46–47</a> is impossible to say.</p><p>8. Levite and chief of the family of Hebron, who was involved in bringing the ark to Jerusalem in David’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:9\">1&nbsp;Chr 15:9</a>).</p><p>9. Priest who assisted in bringing the ark to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:11\">1&nbsp;Chr 15:11</a>); possibly the same as #8 above.</p><p>10. Levite who assisted Conaniah in the administration of the tithes, contributions, and dedicated things given to the temple during Hezekiah’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr31:13\">2&nbsp;Chr 31:13</a>).</p>",
