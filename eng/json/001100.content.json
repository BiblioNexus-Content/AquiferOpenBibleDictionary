A building is something that people make for shelter or use, like a house, temple, or city wall. The Bible talks often about building or rebuilding altars, temples, homes, and cities. Sometimes the Bible uses the word <em>build</em> as a picture of God’s work in his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:8\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:4–8</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2888\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Architecture</span>.</p>",
