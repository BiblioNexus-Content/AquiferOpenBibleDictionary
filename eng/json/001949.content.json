An exorcist is a person who performs an exorcism.</p><p>Many people in the ancient Near East claimed they could drive out or control demons. Some of the miracles of Jesus recorded in the Gospels are exorcisms. But <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:13\">Acts 19:13</a> is the only other biblical reference to exorcism among the Jews. But, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14-1Sam16:23\">1&nbsp;Samuel 16:14â€“23</a>, David acted as an exorcist when he played his harp to drive away an evil spirit from King Saul.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3977\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Demon</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3976\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Demon-possession</span>.</p>",
