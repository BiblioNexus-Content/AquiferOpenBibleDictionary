    "content": "<h1>OAK</h1><p>At least five types of oak trees grow in Palestine. One of these is the kermes oak (<em>Quercus coccifera</em>), which hosts the insect <em>Coccus ilicis</em>. This insect produces a scarlet (red) dye used for coloring linen and wool (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:28-Gen38:30\">Genesis 38:28–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:4\">Exodus 25:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod26:1\">26:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:33\">28:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod35:23\">35:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod39:24\">39:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev14:4-Lev14:6,Lev14:51-Lev14:52\">Leviticus 14:4–6, 51–52</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num19:6\">Numbers 19:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr2:7,2Chr2:14\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:7, 14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr3:14\">3:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:18\">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:19\">Hebrews 9:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev18:12\">Revelation 18:12</a>).</p><p>The kermes oak grows from 1.8 to 10.7 meters (6 to 35 feet) tall. It grows in the mountainous areas of Syria, Lebanon, and Israel and the surrounding areas. When it grows alone, the kermes oak often becomes a large tree. In the East, people regularly planted oak trees near tombs. During biblical times, oak trees were respected and even honored for their large size and strength. Important people were usually buried in the shade of oak trees. Abraham&apos;s oak in Hebron is one example.</p><p>A second type is the valonia oak (<em>Quercus aegilops</em>), possibly the oak mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:13\">Isaiah 2:13 </a>and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:14\">44:14</a>. It is common in middle mountain zones and was probably widespread in the area around Bashan.</p><p>The oak in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:4,Gen35:8\">Genesis 35:4, 8</a> is thought to be the holm oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>), an evergreen oak that grows up to 18.3 meters (60 feet) tall.</p><p>Another type is <em>Quercus lusitanica</em>, the cypress oak. This is a small deciduous tree that rarely grows more than 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall. People sometimes ate the very large acorns from this tree.</p><p>The word translated as &quot;plain&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:6\">Genesis 12:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:18\">13:18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:13\">14:13</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:1\">18:1</a> in the King James Version should probably be translated as &quot;oak&quot; (as in the Berean Standard Bible).</p><p>The many references to &quot;Asherah poles&quot; in the Old Testament, usually connected with the worship of Baal or other non-Israelite gods, may have sometimes been associated with sacred oak groves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:13\">Exodus 34:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut16:21\">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:7\">Judges 3:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:23\">1&nbsp;Kings 14:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:19\">18:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:16\">2&nbsp;Kings 17:16</a>). These were places where people performed pagan worship rituals.</p>",
