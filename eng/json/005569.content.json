    "content": "<h1>THISTLE, THORN</h1><p>The Bible uses 22 different Hebrew and Greek words to describe spiny or prickly shrubs or weeds. These words are translated as &quot;bramble,&quot; &quot;brier,&quot; &quot;cockle,&quot; &quot;thorn,&quot; and &quot;thistle.&quot; Today, about 125 species of thorns and thistles grow in the Holy Land.</p><p>The thornbush mentioned in the story of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:14-Judg9:15\">Judges 9:14–15 </a>is likely the European boxthorn or desert-thorn (<em>Lycium europaeum</em>).</p><p>Most scholars agree that the &quot;briers&quot; and &quot;thorns&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:17\">Isaiah 10:17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:13\">55:13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic7:4\">Micah 7:4</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:8\">Hebrews 6:8</a> refer to the Palestine nightshade (<em>Solanum incanum</em>), also called the &quot;Jericho potato.&quot;</p><p>The thistles in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:18\">Genesis 3:17–18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:9\">2&nbsp;Kings 14:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:18\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos10:8\">Hosea 10:8</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt7:16\">Matthew 7:16</a>, as well as the thorns of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:7\">Matthew 13:7</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:8\">Hebrews 6:8</a>, are thought to be one of the species of the thistle (<em>Centaurea</em>). Common thistles in the Holy Land include:</p><ul><li><p>the true star-thistle (<em>Centaurea calcitrap</em>a), </p></li><li><p>the dwarf centaury (<em>Centaurea verutum</em>), </p></li><li><p>the Iberian centaury (<em>Centaurea iberica</em>), and </p></li><li><p>the lady&apos;s thistle (<em>Silybum marianum</em>). </p></li></ul><p>Some thistles can grow as tall as 0.9 to 1.8 meters (5 to 6 feet). Thistles typically grow in areas that are not cultivated and are neglected. Many thistles have beautiful flowers, but all have sharp spines.</p><p>The &quot;briers&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek2:6\">Ezekiel 2:6</a> and the &quot;pricking brier&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek28:24\">Ezekiel 28:24</a> may refer to the prickly butchers-broom or knee-holly (<em>Ruscus aculeatus</em>). This plant commonly grows in rocky woods in the northern parts of the Holy Land, especially around Mount Tabor and Mount Carmel.</p><p>The stinkweed mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:40\">Job 31:40 </a>probably refers to the corn cockle (<em>Agrostemma githago</em>). This plant is common in grainfields throughout the Holy Land. It is a strong-growing and troublesome weed that grows from 0.3 to 0.9 meter (1 to 3 feet) tall.</p><p>Many Bible scholars think that the &quot;thorns&quot; used to make the crown of thorns (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:29\">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:2\">John 19:2</a>) came from the Christ-thorn (<em>Paliurus spina-christi</em>). This belief led to its scientific name. The Christ-thorn is a spiny plant that usually grows as a spreading shrub 0.9 to 2.7 meters (3 to 9 feet) tall. The flexible branches have a pair of unequal, stiff, sharp spines at the base of each leaf. The young branches are unusually flexible, making them easy to weave into a crown-like wreath.</p><p>The thorns mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:7\">Judges 8:7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:19\">Isaiah 7:19</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:18\">9:18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:13\">55:13</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt7:16\">Matthew 7:16</a> may refer to the Syrian Christ-thorn (<em>Zizyphus spina-christi</em>). This plant can be a shrub or small tree 2.7 to 4.6 meters (9 to 15 feet) tall, sometimes growing into a 12.2-meter (40-foot) tree. It has smooth white branches with a pair of strong, unequal, curved-back spines behind each leaf.</p><p>See also <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3493\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bramble</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"209531\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Buckthorn</span>.</p>",
