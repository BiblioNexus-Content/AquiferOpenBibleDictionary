People dry the roots and the fuzzy, spike-shaped young stems before the leaves open. These dried parts are used to make perfume.</p><p>In India, people still use nard as a perfume for hair. There is good evidence that the spikenard mentioned in the Bible originally came from India (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:12\">Song of Solomon 1:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:13-Song4:14\">4:13â€“14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:3\">Mark 14:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:3\">John 12:3</a>).</p>",
