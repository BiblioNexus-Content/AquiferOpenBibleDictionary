    "content": "<h1>ASCENSION OF CHRIST</h1><p>The ascension is the event when Jesus ascended (went up to) heaven after his resurrection from the dead.</p><h2>What Does the Bible Say About the Ascension of Christ?</h2><p>Among the New Testament writers, only Luke described Jesus’s ascension. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11\">Acts 1:9–11</a> describes a scene in which Jesus was “taken up” and disappeared into a cloud. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:51\">Luke 24:50–51</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:12\">Acts 1:12</a> locate that final event near Bethany. Bethany is east of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives.</p><p>Matthew ended his history before the day of Pentecost. John did not describe the ascension directly, but he included Jesus&apos;s own words about it. Jesus said he would leave but return later (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:22\">John 21:22</a>). He cannot be touched, for he must ascend (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:17\">20:17</a>). Many will believe without having seen him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:29\">20:29</a>). </p><p>The Gospels tell us three main things:</p><ol><li><p>After rising from death, Jesus appeared to his disciples. </p></li><li><p>At some point in time, those appearances stopped. </p></li><li><p>Though Jesus is not physically present, he is spiritually present with his church. </p></li></ol><p>Other New Testament writings agree with this. The apostle Paul wrote that God raised Christ from the dead “<span>and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:20\">Ephesians 1:20</a>). The writer of Hebrews said, “<span>He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:3\">Hebrews 1:3</a>).</p><h2>Why Does the Ascension Matter?</h2><p>The ascension is important for two reasons: what it means for Christ and what it means for Christians.</p><h3>What Does the Ascension Mean for Christ?</h3><p>For Christ, the ascension is the necessary entrance into his heavenly “glorification.” In his glorification, he sits on the right hand of the Father until his enemies are completely defeated. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1\">Psalm 110:1</a> uses symbolic language to describe this: &quot;<span>Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot; (</span>This Psalm is the most quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament.) The ascension is proof of his glorification and his superiority over such Old Testament heroes as David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:33-Acts2:36\">Acts 2:33–36</a>). </p><p>By his ascension, Christ rises over all and fills all (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:10\">Ephesians 4:10</a>). In his ascension, he receives “the name that is over every name” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11\">Philemon 2:9–11</a>). For the author of the book of Hebrews, the ascension is also proof of Christ’s superiority to angels. He sits enthroned while they are constantly being sent out to serve (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:13-Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:13–14</a>). Angels, authorities, and powers are all subject to the ascended Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16\">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22\">1&nbsp;Peter 3:22</a>).</p><h3>What Does the Ascension Mean For Christians?</h3><p>For the Christian, the ascension of Christ is meaningful in four ways:</p><ol><li><p> Without it there would be no gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit could not come until Jesus had ascended and sent him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:7\">John 16:7</a>). Without the ascension, the church would have Jesus locally in one place, not spiritually present “<span>where two or three gather together</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:20\">Matthew 18:20</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:20\">28:20</a>).</p></li><li><p>Since a truly human Jesus has ascended to heaven, human beings can also ascend there. Jesus went “to prepare a place” for his followers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:2\">John 14:2</a>). The hope of those who are “in Christ” is that they will eventually ascend to be with him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:10\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:1–10</a>).</p></li><li><p>The ascension proves that the sacrifice of Christ is finished and accepted by God. Jesus has passed through the heavens (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:14\">Hebrews 4:14</a>). He entered the presence of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:20\">6:20</a>). This presence is described as the most holy place of the heavenly temple. It is the real temple of which the one on earth was a copy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:24\">9:24</a>). Christ brought a single, final sacrifice to God that never needs to be repeated (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:12\">9:12</a>). Then Christ sat down, showing that no repetition of his sacrifice is necessary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:3\">1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:12\">10:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:2\">12:2</a>).</p></li><li><p>The ascension means that there is a human being in heaven who sympathizes with humanity and can therefore speak on behalf of humanity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:1\">1&nbsp;John 2:1</a>). Jesus has experienced everything humans experience. He experienced birth, growth, temptation, suffering, and death. Jesus can serve effectively as a mediator before God in heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:17\">Hebrews 2:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb5:7-Heb5:10\">5:7–10</a>). Christ’s ascension assures the church that God understands what it is like to be human, and that Christians can approach him boldly in their prayers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16\">4:14–16</a>).</p></li></ol><p>The ascension of Christ is a vital part of New Testament teaching. It shows Christ&apos;s high position and gives Christians confidence and hope.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3716\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Christology</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5521\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of</span>.</p>",
