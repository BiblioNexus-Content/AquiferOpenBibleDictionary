    "content": "<h1>KETURAH</h1><p>Keturah was the second wife of Abraham. The Bible does not clearly state if Abraham married her before or after Sarah died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:1\">Genesis 25:1</a>). Abraham and Keturah had six sons together:</p><ol><li><p>Zimran</p></li><li><p>Jokshan</p></li><li><p>Medan</p></li><li><p>Midian</p></li><li><p>Ishbak</p></li><li><p>Shuah (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:2\">Genesis 25:2</a>)</p></li></ol><p>Keturah did not have the same status as Sarah. The Bible calls her a concubine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:6\">Genesis 25:6</a>, compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:32\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:32</a>). Her sons received gifts from Abraham instead of sharing in his inheritance. </p><p>The sons of Keturah became ancestors of tribes that Israel later had contact with after they entered the promised land. The most important of these tribes were Midian and Jokshan&apos;s sons Sheba and Dedan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:3\">Genesis 25:3</a>). These tribes settled in the northern and central regions near the Euphrates River, extending into the central parts of the Arabian Desert.</p><p>The people worked as merchants and shepherds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen37:1-Gen37:36\">Genesis 37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:16\">Exodus 2:16</a>). They took part in international trade (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:6\">Isaiah 60:6</a>). For example, the queen of Sheba, who was a descendant of Jokshan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:3\">Genesis 25:3</a>), visited Solomon to start trading with Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:2\">1&nbsp;Kings 10:2</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2488\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Abraham</span>.</p>",
