This made them useful for soldiers and travelers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:19</a>). They were used as offerings to idols (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos3:1\">Hosea 3:1</a>). Sometimes they were served as aphrodisiacs to increase sexual desire (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:5\">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>).</p>",
