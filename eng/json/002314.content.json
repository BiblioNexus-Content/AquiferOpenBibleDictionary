    "content": "<h1>HADAD-RIMMON</h1><p>Combination of two storm deities, Hadad (mentioned in the Ugaritic texts) and Rimmon (Babylonian storm god). Hadad-rimmon was formerly thought to be a place. The Ras Shamra material equated Hadad with the vegetation god Baal, who was worshiped in an effort to ensure agricultural productivity. Canaanite fertility rituals included periodic mourning for the deceased Baal by the goddess Anat, his consort. It is to that rite that <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech12:11\">Zechariah 12:11</a> alludes. The messianic reference in the previous verse likens the grief in Jerusalem to the lamentation for Hadad-rimmon at the rites near Megiddo.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3573\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Canaanite Deities and Religion</span>.</p>",
