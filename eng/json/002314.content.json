Hadadezer tried to take back control of this region, but David fought him and won (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:3-2Sam8:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:3–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:3-1Chr18:10\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:3–10</a>).</p><p>When the Syrians came to help Hadadezer, David defeated them too. He also took control of Damascus, a major city in Syria.</p><p>Later, David sent men to show kindness to Hanun, the new king of Ammon, after Hanun’s father Nahash died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10</a>). But Hanun treated David’s men badly. He humiliated them (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:4\">4</a>).</p><p>After that, Ammon prepared for war and asked Syria to help them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6\">2 Samuel 10:6</a>). David sent Joab, his army commander, to fight the combined armies of Ammon and Syria. Joab defeated them (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:15-2Sam10:19\">15–19</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:16,1Chr19:19\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:16, 19</a>). </p><p>After this defeat, Hadadezer sent more troops from the area beyond the Euphrates River. The armies met at a place called Helam. David fought them there and won again. After this, Hadadezer asked for peace and agreed to pay tribute to Israel.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7853\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Syria, Syrians</span>.</p>",
