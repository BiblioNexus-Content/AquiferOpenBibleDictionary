    "content": "<h1>ELECT, ELECTION</h1><p>In modern English, these words refer to the process of choosing a leader or representative by a group of people. This involves choosing from several candidates.</p><p>When the verb “elect” is used theologically in the Bible, it usually refers to God&apos;s actions. God does the choosing. In the Old Testament, it is used for God’s choice of Israel to be his people (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:17\">Acts 13:17</a>). Israel became God’s people, not because they decided to belong to him, but because God chose them. God did this because of his promise to Abraham, not because of anything special about Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:7-Deut7:8\">Deuteronomy 7:7–8</a>). God also chose their leaders, such as Saul and David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:24\">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:21\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:21</a>). These choices were made by God alone, not by people voting. The word thus indicates God’s authority to decide what will happen, independent of human choice.</p><p>The New Testament has similar ideas. God’s people are described as his “elect” or “chosen ones.” This phrase was used by Jesus when talking about a future time when the Son of Man (a title Jesus used for himself) will come and gather together God’s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:20,Mark13:27\">Mark 13:20, 27</a>). Jesus will show that God&apos;s people were right to suffer and wait patiently for him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:7\">Luke 18:7</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a>, God’s people are called a “chosen [elect] people.” This phrase was originally used of the people of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa43:20\">Isaiah 43:20</a>). It shows that God&apos;s people in the Old Testament and the Christian church in the New Testament are connected. The promises God made to Israel are now coming true in the church.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36\">Romans 9–11, </a>Paul talks about a problem: Why have most Jewish people rejected the good news about Jesus, while many non-Jewish people have accepted it? He says that right now, there is a small group (or remnant) of Jewish people who believe. God chose this group because of his kindness. This group is “the elect.” This small group has received what God meant for all of Israel. Paul says that many did not accept the message because they became less receptive to it. He describes this as a “hardening,“ which he relates to the general human tendency to turn away from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:5-Rom11:7\">Romans 11:5–7</a>).</p><p>However, Paul says God has not canceled his choice of Israel as his people. He explains that while many Jewish people have not accepted the message about Jesus, this has allowed non-Jewish people to receive God&apos;s blessings. Paul emphasizes that God still loves the Jewish people and will not take back his promises to them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:28\">Romans 11:28</a>). Because of this, Paul believes that in the future, many Jewish people will turn to God.</p><p>The word translated “elect” is usually found in its plural form in the Bible. It refers to all of God&apos;s people or to members of a specific local church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:33\">Romans 8:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:4\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:1\">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:1-1Pet1:2\">1&nbsp;Peter 1:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet1:10\">2&nbsp;Peter 1:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:14\">Revelation 17:14</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:13\">Romans 16:13</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2John1:13\">2&nbsp;John 1:13</a>, which have the singular form). There are two possible reasons for using the plural form. Most New Testament letters were written to groups, not individuals. More likely, it shows that God chooses a community of people, not just separate individuals.</p><p>The word &quot;election&quot; shows that being part of God&apos;s people starts with God&apos;s choice. This choice happened before time began, before anyone could respond (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:4\">Ephesians 1:4</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:16,John15:19\">John 15:16, 19</a>). It is God who has called men and women to be his people, and those who respond are elect. God does not choose people because they are good or deserving. In fact, he often picks:</p><ul><li><p>Those the world sees as foolish, to embarrass the wise</p></li><li><p>The weak, to defeat the strong</p></li><li><p>Those seen as unimportant, to show that important people are not special (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:27-1Cor1:28\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:27–28</a>)</p></li></ul><p>This means the elect cannot brag about their achievements or status. Everything they are comes from God. They cannot boast or think they are better than others.</p><p>God&apos;s chosen people have special benefits: </p><ul><li><p>God supports them, so no one can accuse them in a way that would make God reject them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:33\">Romans 8:33</a>). </p></li><li><p>They are like royal priests. This means they can come to God directly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a>). </p></li><li><p>The early Christian leaders known as apostles went through hard times for them. They did this so God&apos;s people could have salvation and live forever with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:10</a>).</p></li></ul><p>The elect are known for their faith in God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:1\">Titus 1:1</a>). They should act in ways that show they are God&apos;s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>). They must make their calling and election sure. That is, they must show that they belong to God by how they live (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet1:10\">2&nbsp;Peter 1:10</a>). They must continue being faithful to the Lord who called them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:14\">Revelation 17:14</a>).</p><p>The relationship between God’s call and human response is explained in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:14\">Matthew 22:14</a>: “<span>For many are called, but few are chosen.</span>” Although God calls many through the gospel, only some of those respond to the call and become his elect people. </p><p>The Bible does not fully explain why only some people become God&apos;s people. Certainly, when a person does respond to God’s call, it is because the gospel comes to him or her “<span>in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with great conviction</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:4-1Thess1:5\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:4–5</a>). When men and women refuse the gospel, it is because they have become hardened as a result of sin and their trust in their own works. The Bible does not explain more than this, so Christians should not try to add their own explanations.</p><p>“Election” can also mean God choosing people for special tasks. Jesus chose the 12 disciples out of the larger group of those who followed him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:13\">Luke 6:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:2\">Acts 1:2</a>). Likewise, in John’s Gospel, Jesus said that although he chose the 12 disciples, he calls Judas, who betrayed him, “a devil” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:70\">John 6:70</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:18\">13:18</a>). When Judas needed to be replaced with another disciple, the church prayed to Jesus. They asked him to show them which of two men to choose to be included among the Twelve (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:24\">Acts 1:24</a>). Peter said God chose him to tell non-Jewish people about (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:7\">15:7</a>). Likewise, Paul said God chose him to bring the message to non-Jewish people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:15\">9:15</a>). These examples show that God takes the first step in Christian mission. He chooses people to serve him in different ways.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4458\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Foreknowledge</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4459\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Foreordination</span>.</p>",
