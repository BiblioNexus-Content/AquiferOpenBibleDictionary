    "content": "<h1>LAST DAYS</h1><p>An expression used in the Bible to describe the final period of the world as we know it. In the Old Testament, the last days are seen as the time when the Messiah&apos;s promises will come true (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:2\">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic4:1\">Micah 4:1</a>). In the New Testament, the writers believe they are already living in the last days, which they see as the era of the gospel. For example, Peter explains that the events on the Day of Pentecost fulfill the prophecy from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:28\">Joel 2:28</a>: “In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on My menservants and maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:18\">Acts 2:17–18</a>). The writer of the letter to the Hebrews says, “On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets. But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:2\">Hebrews 1:1–2</a>).</p><p>The last days are a time of great blessing. The world can now freely access the benefits of salvation. They come from the perfect life, death, resurrection, and glorification of Jesus Christ. Now, unbelievers can repent and turn to God. Believers must spread the gospel worldwide.</p><p>The phrase &quot;last days&quot; suggests that this period will last for some time. This understanding is confirmed by the fact that this final age has already continued for many centuries. However, from the perspective of eternity, it is a brief period. In every generation, the end of this final age is always seen as coming soon, so much so that John refers to it as “the last hour.” The presence of antichrists (those opposed to Christ) even within the early church is a sign of this. John says, “<span>It is the last hour; and just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:18\">1&nbsp;John 2:18</a>). The end of these last days is always near, and it will certainly come one day. This is why Christ urges us to be watchful. We do not know the day or hour of his glorious return. It will end these last days (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:44\">Matthew 24:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:13\">25:13</a>).</p><p>This idea naturally leads to the teaching that the last days will culminate in “the Day.” The last days will end with the last day. The use of &quot;day&quot; in the singular form in the New Testament corresponds to the concept of the &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; in the Old Testament.  It is a terrifying day of judgment for the unrepentant. But, it promises salvation for God&apos;s people (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:12-Isa2:22\">Isaiah 2:12–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek13:5\">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel1:15\">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:1\">2:1, 11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:24\">Amos 5:18–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph1:7\">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>). The climax of these last days, and thus of all history, will be “the day of the Lord,” which will come upon the world suddenly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:2\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:2</a>). This final day will be the day of the last judgment for those who have rejected the gospel. It will also be the day when our fallen world is purified and the created order is restored. In the new heaven and new earth, all of God&apos;s purposes in creation will be fulfilled. When our redemption is complete, we will be like our Redeemer. Then, we will enjoy his eternal glory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:25\">Romans 8:19–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:2\">1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:8\">Revelation 21:1–8</a>).</p><p>The apostle Paul reminds Christians. On the last day, &quot;the Day,&quot; their lives will be revealed. What they have done will be known. This does not affect the security of their salvation in Christ. Instead, it determines whether they will meet him with confidence or with shame at his coming (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:28\">1&nbsp;John 2:28</a>. Paul writes, “His workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work. If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13-1Cor3:15\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:13–15</a>).</p><p>The last of the last days will end. Then, Christ&apos;s kingdom will begin. God will be all in all (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:28\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:20-Phil3:21\">Philippians 3:20–21</a>). The last day is also a day of triumph and resurrection. Christ has promised to raise everyone who believes in him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:39-John6:44\">John 6:39–44, 54</a>). The last days are like night when compared to the glory that will be revealed at Christ’s return, so the end of these last days will also be the beginning of God’s unending day (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:11-Rom13:12\">Romans 13:11–12</a>). Knowing that we are in the last days and that the last day is approaching should greatly impact how we live our lives today (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:11-2Pet3:14\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:11–14</a>).</p><p>In summary, the last days are the days of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. They prepare us for the last day. It will be the final judgment of unbelievers. For believers, it will be the beginning of eternal glory. For Christ&apos;s faithful followers, these are days of joy and blessing. But we still await a full redemption. They are days of trial and suffering for the church, but God has assured us of his Spirit in our hearts. This Spirit is a hint of the taste of the full banquet to come. It is a down payment that promises full payment in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:23\">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:22\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:5\">5:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:14\">Ephesians 1:14</a>). Meanwhile, we can be confident with the apostle Paul that the sufferings of these last days are not worth comparing to the glory that will be revealed to us (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:18\">Romans 8:18</a>). These days are also a time of responsibility and opportunity. Christians have the responsibility to proclaim the gospel throughout the world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:19-Matt28:20\">Matthew 28:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:8\">Acts 1:8</a>), and God commands all people everywhere to repent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:30\">Acts 17:30</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3940\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Day of the Lord</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7370\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Second Coming of Christ</span>.</p>",
