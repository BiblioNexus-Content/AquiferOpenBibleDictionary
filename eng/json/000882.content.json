    "content": "<h1>BETHANY</h1><p>1. A village on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. This village is sometimes called &quot;Bethany on the Mount of Olives.&quot; It is about a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) east of Jerusalem. Jesus and his disciples sometimes stayed in Bethany when in Judea. For example, they stayed here when they attended temple observances during Passover (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:17\">Matthew 21:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:11\">Mark 11:11</a>). Jesus was eating at the home of Simon the leper in Bethany when a woman came and anointed his head with costly perfume (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13\">Matthew 26:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:3-Mark14:9\">Mark 14:3–9</a>). </p><p>Bethany was also the home of Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus. This is where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:1,John11:18\">John 11:1, 18</a>). The village was near Bethphage on an approach to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:1\">Mark 11:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:29\">Luke 19:29</a>) that Jesus followed in preparation for his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. In Bethany, Jesus blessed his disciples after the resurrection and parted from them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:50\">Luke 24:50</a>). Today the town is called el-Azariyeh (the place of Lazarus).</p><p>2. A village on “the other side of the Jordan” (the east side), where John the Baptist baptized (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:28\">John 1:28</a>). It is often called &quot;Bethany beyond the Jordan.&quot;</p>",
