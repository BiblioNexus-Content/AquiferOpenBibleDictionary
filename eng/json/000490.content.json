The river runs from east to west through a canyon with walls 457 meters (1,500 feet) high into the Dead Sea. </p><p>At the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the gorge served as a&nbsp;natural border between Moab to the south and the Ammonite kingdoms to the north (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:13-Num21:15\">Numbers 21:13–15</a>). </p><p>After the division of the land under Joshua, the river Arnon became the southern boundary of Reuben’s territory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:12,Deut3:16\">Deuteronomy 3:12, 16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:16\">Joshua 13:16</a>).</p>",
