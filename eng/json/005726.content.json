Uriah&apos;s wife was Bathsheba. David had an affair with her while Uriah was fighting the Ammonites. Upon learning of her pregnancy, David summoned Uriah to Jerusalem. He hoped Uriah would sleep with his wife and consider himself the father. Uriah slept in the servants&apos; quarters. He would not enjoy home while his companions were at war. The second night David again tried to entice him to sleep with his wife. Uriah, despite a drunken stupor, would not go home. So, he spent the night at the palace. To deepen the intrigue, David sent Uriah back to the battle. He ordered Uriah to a vulnerable spot, where he was killed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27\">2&nbsp;Samuel 11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:6\">Matthew 1:6</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3937\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">David</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4580\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Genealogy of Jesus Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>A priest who built an altar at Jerusalem in imitation of an Assyrian model at King Ahaz of Judah’s request (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:16\">2&nbsp;Kings 16:10</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:16\">16</a>).</p></li><li><p>A priest who was the father of Meremoth. Meremoth weighed the silver, gold, and vessels for the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33\">Ezra 8:33</a>) and built parts of the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21\">Nehemiah 3:4, 21</a>).</p></li><li><p>One of the men who stood to Ezra’s right when Ezra read the law to the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:4\">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). He is perhaps the same man as #3 above.</p></li><li><p>A priest whom Isaiah took as a witness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:2\">Isaiah 8:2</a>).

Fearing for his life, Uriah fled to Egypt but was eventually abducted and brought back to King Jehoiakim, who put him to death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:20-Jer26:23\">Jeremiah 26:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:20-Jer26:23\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:20-Jer26:23\">23</a>).</p></li></ol>",
