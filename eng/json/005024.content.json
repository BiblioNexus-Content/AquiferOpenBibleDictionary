    "content": "<h1>SHAPHAN</h1><p>1. Son of Azaliah and the father of Ahikam, Elasah, and Gemariah. He and his household favored Josiah’s reforms, supported the prophet Jeremiah, and complied with Babylonian hegemony.</p><p>Shaphan served as the royal secretary to Josiah, king of Judah (640–609 BC). He read the Book of the Law to the king after it was found by the high priest Hilkiah in the sanctuary of Jerusalem. Later, Josiah sent him with a small delegation to hear the words of the prophetess Huldah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:3-2Kgs22:14\">2&nbsp;Kgs 22:3–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr34:8-2Chr34:28\">2&nbsp;Chr 34:8–28</a>).</p><p>Shaphan’s sons were mentioned among the political leaders of Judah during the days of its desolation by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (605–586 BC). Ahikam assisted with the repair of the sanctuary and protected Jeremiah from the men who sought his death during the reign of King Jehoiakim (609–598 BC; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:12\">2&nbsp;Kgs 22:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:24\">Jer 26:24</a>). Elasah delivered a message from King Zedekiah of Judah (597–586 BC) to Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer29:3\">Jer 29:3</a>). Gemariah was the prince of Judah from whose chamber Baruch read the scroll of Jeremiah to the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:10-Jer36:12\">36:10–12</a>).</p><p>Shaphan was the grandfather of Micaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:11-Jer36:13\">Jer 36:11–13</a>) and Gedaliah. Gedaliah was appointed governor of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:22\">2&nbsp;Kgs 25:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer40:5-Jer40:11\">Jer 40:5–11</a>) and ordered to protect Jeremiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer39:14\">Jer 39:14</a>). Gedaliah was later murdered by a mob led by Ishmael (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:2\">41:2</a>).</p><p>2. Father of Jaazaniah and, in Ezekiel’s vision, a leader of idolatrous practices in Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:11\">Ez 8:11</a>).</p>",
