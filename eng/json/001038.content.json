    "content": "<h1>BOOK OF JOB</h1><p>An Old Testament book that is part of the scriptural category known as the Writings.</p><h2>Preview</h2><ul><li><p>Author</p></li><li><p>Date</p></li><li><p>Background</p></li><li><p>Purpose and Theological Teaching</p></li><li><p>Content</p></li></ul><h2>Author</h2><p>The authorship of the book of Job is a challenging question. This is because no one is credited as the author, and some scholars believe the book is a mix of several literary works.</p><p>Some scholars believe the book is a composite work due to inconsistencies among its sections. They see the prologue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:1-Job2:13\">Job 1–2</a>) and the epilogue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:17\">42:7–17</a>) as separate from the main text. These parts show Job as a man of perfect moral character. However, the dialogues portray a more human Job, whose statements about God can be bold and surprising.</p><p>Job is shown as a man of perfect moral character in the beginning. He refuses his wife’s advice to curse God, as noted in the prologue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:9-Job2:10\">Job 2:9–10</a>). He also does not curse God in the dialogues. The book&apos;s main point seems to be that even someone with high moral character struggles with understanding God&apos;s ways. After the misfortunes in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:1-Job1:22\">Job 1</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:13\">2</a>, and a period of inner struggle during the seven days and nights before he spoke (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:11-Job2:13\">2:11–13</a>), Job faces deep questions. Job&apos;s strong moral character is clear in the dialogues. Even though he does not understand God, he speaks truthfully before him.</p><p>Some people believe that certain parts of the book were added later. These include: </p><ul><li><p>Elihu&apos;s speeches (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job32:1-Job37:24\">Job 32–37</a>)</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s discourse (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:1-Job41:34\">Job 38–41</a>)</p></li><li><p>The wisdom discourse in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job28:1-Job28:28\">Job 28</a></p></li></ul><p>Some scholars think the final author used these existing works to create a structure for his own writing.</p><p>The book&apos;s main structure, with a prologue, dialogues, and an epilogue, may not result from complex editing. The Code of Hammurabi has a similar structure, as does an ancient Egyptian work called <em>A Dispute over Suicide.</em></p><p>Regarding the authorship issue, it is best to say the author is unknown. His theology is clearly focused on Yahweh, so he was likely a Hebrew. His writing skills were impressive, as he created one of the finest works in history.</p><h2>Date</h2><p>The authorship of the book is uncertain, which also makes the date unclear. Most modern scholars believe the book was written in the postexilic period, around the fifth century BC. Some think it was written near the end of the exile. Others suggest it was from the time of Solomon, while some place it in the era of the patriarchs.</p><p>The internal evidence suggests the book is set in ancient times. There are no references to Levitical institutions. Job offers sacrifices for his family, similar to the time before the priesthood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:5\">Job 1:5</a>). Job&apos;s wealth, described in livestock, reflects the patriarchal era (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:3\">Job 1:3</a>).</p><p>The language of the book suggests an early date. Some linguistic elements show older forms of Hebrew, similar to those in Ugaritic epic material. Job may have lived in the second millennium BC. If the book, or part of it, was written then, it might be the first written material in the biblical canon. The book may have reached its final form during the Solomonic era, when much of the Hebrew Wisdom Literature was created.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>The book of Job is part of the Old Testament materials called Wisdom Literature. This literature addresses basic human life issues. The Israelites were not the only ancient people to create Wisdom Literature. Pagan cultures also produced this type of material, often trying to explain human events within their religious beliefs.</p><p>Several ancient works similar to the Old Testament book of Job are known from ancient cultures. A Sumerian book exists that does not match the biblical book in literary scope or emotional depth. It tells the story of a young man whose sorrow turns to joy after he pleads with his personal deity. In Sumerian belief, the gods caused both good and evil. Only appeasing them could prevent the evil they might cause. The book does not try to explain or explore the problem of evil in the world.</p><p>A Babylonian book, often called <em>I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom,</em> is similar to the Sumerian <em>Job</em> in philosophy. The writer vividly describes his suffering. No one can help him. He questions if his religious rituals truly please a god. An emissary of the god Marduk appears in a dream and eases his suffering. The work ends with praise to Marduk, affirming that his offerings made the gods happy.</p><p>Another work, “A Dialogue about Human Misery,” is similar to the biblical book of Job. It explores how worshiping deities seems to have no impact on one&apos;s life quality. A character in this work tells the sufferer that the ways of the gods are hard to understand, and humans are naturally flawed. The sufferer appeals to the gods, but the dialogue ends there without solving the problem.</p><p>These literary works do not compare to the Old Testament book of Job in theology or philosophy. They only offer a fatalistic view of life, seeing it as controlled by the unpredictable will of the gods. However, these documents, dating from the second to first millennia BC, might be the literary foundation for the book of Job. The book of Job could provide an inspired answer to the deep questions of that historical period. Therefore, this type of literature might suggest an early date for the book of Job.</p><h2>Purpose and Theological Teaching</h2><p>The main purpose of the book of Job has puzzled biblical scholars for a long time. It is hard to say the book solves the problem of evil. When an answer is expected, God asks questions instead of providing answers.</p><p>Some suggest the main purpose is to answer, &quot;Why do the righteous suffer?&quot; The book does address this question, but it also presents other issues. By the end, we only have the comforters&apos; words and Elihu&apos;s statements on the topic, which is not much. This might make one question the purpose of the long dialogues and Job&apos;s internal struggles. When God speaks from the whirlwind, there is no explanation for why the righteous suffer. Instead, Job learns to accept his place in the universe.</p><p>It is best to try a different approach to the book. To find the main theme of a literary work, look at the prologue and the epilogue. The prologue shows what the author plans to do, and the epilogue reveals what the author believes they have achieved.</p><p>In the beginning of Job, the author skillfully creates suspense. We learn about Job&apos;s perfect moral character. Then Satan challenges, “<span>strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:11\">Job 1:11</a>). We wonder if Job will curse God and lose his faith, but then we hear his strong declaration of trust: “<span>The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:21\">Job 1:21</a>).</p><p>The writer creates more suspense when Satan plans to harm Job. Job&apos;s wife adds to the trial by saying, “Curse God and die!” We wonder if this trial will break Job’s faith. The suspense ends when we learn that “<span>In all this, Job did not sin in what he said</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:10\">Job 2:10</a>).</p><p>The writer introduces Job’s friends into the story. They stay silent for seven days. We wonder what Job is thinking. Is he still a man of strong faith, or is his trust fading as the disease harms his body? When Job speaks and curses the day he was born, the suspense grows. The writer makes us question: Will Job’s faith stay strong?</p><p>Sometimes we believe it will happen. Job makes several strong statements of faith. He says that God will prove him right. One of the most powerful statements in the book is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27\">Job 19:25–27</a>: “But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth. Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God. I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!” At other times, Job shows deep doubts about God’s control of the universe. The suspense continues. Throughout the dialogues, we follow the pattern of Job’s struggle. It is an emotional struggle where Job speaks from deep despair and high faith.</p><p>In the epilogue, the suspense is resolved. Job&apos;s trials have not weakened his faith. He emerges victorious, with a humble belief. He can finally say to God, “I know that You can do all things and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted. You asked, ‘Who is this who conceals My counsel without knowledge?’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:2-Job42:3\">Job 42:2–3</a>).</p><p>The writer&apos;s purpose is clear. At the beginning, he asks, “Will Job’s faith endure despite trials?” The dialogues increase suspense, and the ending resolves it. Job stays faithful to God during his suffering. We learn that Job’s faith is genuine.</p><p>The book of Job is a study on faith and how suffering affects it. It teaches that a truly righteous person stays faithful to God, even when God&apos;s justice seems delayed. This person may not understand everything God does, but their faith in God&apos;s good plan and wisdom stays strong. This kind of faith is one part of the overall concept of faith in the Bible. It does not rely on actions but depends entirely on God.</p><p>The New Testament also shows a link between faith and suffering. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:12\">James 1:12</a>, trials and faithfulness are connected: &quot;<span>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love Him</span>&quot; (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3-1Pet1:7\">1&nbsp;Peter 1:3–7</a>). These passages suggest that trials test faith, revealing if it is true or false. Faith that is not true will not withstand suffering (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:20-Matt13:21\">Matthew 13:20–21</a>). The book of Job also links faith and trials, showing the nature of genuine faith, which remains strong despite suffering.</p><p>This book contains important principles: </p><ul><li><p>It teaches that sin leads to punishment. The comforters&apos; words hold some truth, supported by Scripture, but they only partly explain suffering&apos;s role in life.</p></li><li><p>The book also shows that suffering teaches us, as it is discipline from God. </p></li><li><p>When God speaks from the whirlwind, we learn that suffering is part of life, and we must trust the Creator&apos;s wisdom. In this part, God reveals himself personally. Job says, “<span>My ears had heard of You, but now my eyes have seen You</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:5\">Job 42:5</a>). During trials, we need a close God more than a philosophical explanation of evil. </p></li><li><p>The book also highlights how suffering creates true righteousness. Job starts as a righteous man, but his righteousness grows through suffering. By the end, Job is more humble, understands his place in the universe, and accepts God&apos;s wisdom.</p></li></ul><h2>Content</h2><h3>The Prologue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:1-Job2:13\">1:1–2:13</a>)</h3><p>This part of the book explains what caused Job&apos;s suffering. At first, he is shown as a wealthy man who deeply cared for his family.</p><p>In a dramatic scene set in heaven, Satan appears and the Lord asks, “<span>Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:8\">Job 1:8</a>). Satan replies, “<span>But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:11\">Job 1:11</a>). This leads to the first of Job’s great calamities, the loss of his family and possessions.</p><p>Another meeting between the Lord and Satan results in Job&apos;s physical suffering. This terrible disease sets the stage for the upcoming dialogues. Throughout this, the writer makes it clear that Job does not sin. He resists his wife&apos;s plea to curse God and the temptation to abandon God after losing his children. However, the calm scene changes with dialogues as we hear Job&apos;s complaints. We wonder if Job has lost his faith in God.</p><p>Three of Job&apos;s friends come to comfort him. They sit silently with him for seven days, hesitant to speak. After this silence, they start talking with Job.</p><h3>The Dialogues (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:1-Job31:40\">3:1–31:40</a>)</h3><p><strong>The First Cycle</strong> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:1-Job14:22\">3:1–14:22</a>)</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:1-Job3:26\">Job 3</a>, Job questions why God allowed him to be born. He wonders why someone destined to suffer was given life.</p><p>Eliphaz is the first of Job’s friends to speak. He seems polite, but he is actually heartless. He believes Job must have sinned; otherwise, why would he suffer so much (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:7-Job4:11\">Job 4:7–11</a>)? Eliphaz thinks Job&apos;s questions show a negative attitude toward God. He urges Job to trust in the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:8\">Job 4:8</a>) and stop being angry with God, as anger will only lead to ruin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job5:2\">Job 5:2</a>). Eliphaz sees a positive side to suffering, claiming it is discipline from the Almighty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job5:17\">Job 5:17</a>).</p><p>Job responds by saying his anger is justified because of the terrible suffering he is facing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job6:1-Job6:7\">Job 6:1–7</a>). He also complains that Eliphaz is wrong for not showing kindness. He compares Eliphaz to a dry riverbed in the desert that offers no water in the hot, dry season (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job6:14-Job6:23\">Job 6:14–23</a>).</p><p>The next comforter, Bildad, is even more heartless than Eliphaz. He also accuses Job of sinning. His lack of compassion shows when he mentions Job’s children, blaming their deaths on possible sins in their lives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:4\">Job 8:4</a>).</p><p>Bildad, like Eliphaz, urges Job to seek God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:5\">Job 8:5</a>), assuring him that God will respond (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:6\">8:6</a>). He describes Job’s troubles as consequences of turning away from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:11-Job8:19\">Job 8:11–19</a>) but assures him that God will not reject an innocent person (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:20\">Job 8:20</a>).</p><p>Job responds to Bildad with a powerful question: “<span>how can a mortal be righteous before God?</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:2\">Job 9:2</a>). He then describes God&apos;s immense power, visible in the universe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:3-Job9:12\">Job 9:3–12</a>). Job feels helpless before this mighty God. He believes he cannot argue with God or prove his innocence because God is too powerful to challenge.</p><p>Job also complains that he cannot get a fair hearing from God because God thinks he is guilty. The fact that God has punished him with his affliction shows that God does not see him as innocent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:14-Job9:24\">Job 9:14–24</a>). Job continues his response and again questions God&apos;s wisdom in creating him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job10:18-Job10:22\">Job 10:18–22</a>).</p><p>Zophar speaks next. He accuses Job of sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job11:4-Job11:6\">Job 11:4–6</a>). Insultingly, he says God “knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note? But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job11:11-Job11:12\">Job 11:11–12</a>).</p><p>Job becomes angry because of Zophar&apos;s insulting accusations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job12:2-Job12:3\">Job 12:2–3</a>). He asks God to stop afflicting him and demands that God speak (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job13:20-Job13:28\">Job 13:20–28</a>).</p><p><strong>The Second Cycle</strong> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job15:1-Job21:34\">15:1–21:34</a>)</p><p>The second cycle of discussions follows the same pattern as the first. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar keep accusing Job, blaming his misfortune on sin. As the story progresses, the speakers focus more on their own claims. They do not respond to each other&apos;s arguments as directly as they did in the first set of dialogues.</p><p><strong>The Third Cycle </strong>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job22:1-Job31:40\">22:1–31:40</a>)</p><p>In the third series of dialogues, only Eliphaz and Bildad speak. They accuse Job of sin more harshly. Eliphaz claims, “<span>Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless?</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job22:5\">Job 22:5</a>). This third dialogue is unusual because Job speaks more than in the others. While Bildad’s argument lasts only six verses, Job’s reply spans six chapters (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:1-Job31:40\">Job 26–31</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:1-Job31:40\">Job 31</a> is important. In it, Job claims he is innocent. Job&apos;s sincerity is clear. He states he has been morally pure (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:1-Job31:4\">Job 31:1–4</a>), has not lied (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:5-Job31:8\">31:5–8</a>), and has not committed adultery (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:9-Job31:12\">31:9–12</a>). He shows concern for others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:13-Job31:23\">Job 31:13–23</a>) and has not relied on wealth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:24-Job31:28\">Job 31:24–28</a>). He ends with a strong statement of his innocence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:29-Job31:40\">Job 31:29–40</a>).</p><p>A pattern starts to form. Job slowly distances himself from his friends during the discussion. They insist more on sin causing his troubles, while Job strongly claims his innocence. The writer skillfully crafts the story so the reader finds little unusual in the friends&apos; statements. Although we might agree with their words, we cannot support their attitudes. Sin does bring punishment, but the friends focus only on that. The next friend, Elihu, will highlight another purpose of suffering.</p><p>We sense honesty in Job&apos;s claims of innocence. However, if we trust both Job and his comforters, we face Job&apos;s same problem. We do not know the truth. We do not understand why Job suffers.</p><h3>The Speech of Elihu (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job32:1-Job37:24\">32:1–37:24</a>)</h3><p>Elihu is a young man who listens to Job and his friends with growing impatience (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job32:3\">Job 32:3</a>). He is very aware of his youth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job32:6-Job32:22\">Job 32:6–22</a>), but when he speaks, he shows a deeper understanding of suffering than his companions.</p><p>Elihu highlights that God communicates in various ways and that suffering serves as discipline (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job33:19\">Job 33:19</a>), showing God&apos;s goodness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job33:29-Job33:33\">Job 33:29–33</a>). Although Eliphaz mentioned this idea in his first speech (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job5:17\">Job 5:17</a>), Elihu gives it more importance, focusing on how suffering reveals God&apos;s love. However, it seems that this is not the complete answer. Another aspect comes in God&apos;s words.</p><h3>The Voice from the Whirlwind and Job’s Response (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:1-Job42:6\">38:1–42:6</a>)</h3><p>In this section, God speaks. He asks Job many questions about Creation. God asks, “<span>Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?</span>” Then, with sarcasm, he adds, “<span>Tell Me, if you have understanding</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:4\">Job 38:4</a>).</p><p>God talks about the seas and asks Job who made the ocean basins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:8-Job38:11\">Job 38:8–11</a>). He describes the rising dawn and asks Job, “<span>have you commanded the morning or assigned the dawn its place</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:12\">Job 38:12</a>). Further questions relate to: </p><ul><li><p>Light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:19-Job38:21\">Job 38:19–21</a>)</p></li><li><p>Snow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:22-Job38:24\">Job 38:22–24</a>)</p></li><li><p>Rain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:25-Job38:30\">Job 38:25–30</a>)</p></li><li><p>The constellations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:31-Job38:33\">Job 38:31–33</a>)</p></li><li><p>Storms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:34-Job38:38\">Job 38:34–38</a>)</p></li><li><p>Animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:39-Job39:30\">Job 38:39–39:30</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Job realizes the vastness of God’s power shown in Creation. Job likely felt small and insignificant as he thought about God’s might.</p><p>The questions aim to do more than make Job feel insignificant. They also intend to make him feel ashamed of his assumptions. The sarcasm in this part is sharp, and one can imagine Job sinking deeper into the ashes with each question. In the section about light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:19-Job38:21\">Job 38:19–21</a>), the questions &quot;Where is the way to the home of light? Do you know where darkness resides, so you can lead it back to its border? Do you know the paths to its home?&quot; are followed by &quot;<span>Surely you know, for you were already born! And the number of your days is great!</span>&quot; In the section about the constellations, God asks Job, &quot;<span>Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job38:31\">Job 38:31</a>).</p><p>Job has been bold in his statements to God during the dialogues. He has demanded that God speak to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job13:22\">Job 13:22</a>) and accused God of being unjust (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:6-Job19:7\">Job 19:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job24:1\">24:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job27:2\">27:2</a>). Now, as he remembers the power of the Almighty, Job starts to understand his true place in the universe.</p><p>The important questions in this series are in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job41:34\">Job 40:15–41:34</a>. Here, in an unusual order, God directs Job&apos;s attention to Behemoth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:15\">Job 40:15</a>) and Leviathan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job41:1\">41:1</a>). Some scholars view these as mythical figures, but it is likely they are literary depictions of real animals known for their size and strength. Many scholars suggest behemoth is a hippopotamus and leviathan is a crocodile. The descriptions of these animals support this idea. These references to two powerful animals conclude the section where God&apos;s voice speaks from the whirlwind. This section is full of suspense. At the end, the reader sees that Job has learned his lesson (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:1-Job42:3\">Job 42:1–3</a>).</p><p>These questions came to Job with great urgency for an important reason. Job realized he does not control the universe—God does. Job had to face God&apos;s power and learn he is just a part of this vast creation that shows God&apos;s might. By demanding God speak to him, Job tried to control God. </p><p>By suggesting God was unjust, he judged God, making himself equal or superior to God. God required Job to face the universe&apos;s power and reconsider his complaints. Job wanted a God he could control; God required submission. Job wanted a world run his way; God created a world to run his way. Job imagined a false God who would follow his desires. By recognizing God&apos;s control, Job saw that suffering has a purpose. Job might not understand that purpose, but it is part of God&apos;s creation. It is no surprise that Job began to find peace and acknowledge God&apos;s authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:5-Job42:6\">Job 42:5–6</a>).</p><p>This section of questions is followed by a powerful response from Job. He acknowledges God&apos;s power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:2\">Job 42:2</a>). He admits he did not fully understand things too amazing for him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:3\">Job 42:3</a>), and he repents in dust and ashes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:6\">42:6</a>).</p><h3>The Epilogue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:17\">42:7–17</a>)</h3><p>The final part of the book starts by criticizing Job’s comforters. They are condemned because they did not speak correctly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:7\">Job 42:7</a>). This seems unusual since their words appeared orthodox. However, they did not provide the right answer to the problem of suffering. Their answer was incomplete and therefore dangerous. They portrayed God as a strict being who used suffering only to punish sin. Unlike Elihu&apos;s answer, they did not consider the possibility of God&apos;s loving presence in suffering.</p><p>Although Job said some harsh things about God, he was not criticized. The text states that Job spoke rightly about God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:8\">Job 42:8</a>). This likely refers to Job’s final words in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:1-Job42:6\">Job 42:1–6</a>, where, purified by suffering, he humbly submitted to God&apos;s sovereign will.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5563\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Job (Person) #2</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8245\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wisdom</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8242\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wisdom Literature</span>.</p>",
