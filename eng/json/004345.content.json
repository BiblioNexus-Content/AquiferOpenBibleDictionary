    "content": "<h1>PATARA</h1><p>Patara was a seaport of the ancient region of Lycia, now located in modern Turkey. The ancient city was one of the largest and most prosperous of the region. It was a center of trade and business. A temple to Apollo stood in Patara. Remains of a theater and baths are still there. Common wind patterns made Patara a convenient place for ships to begin their voyages to the eastern Mediterranean. The apostle Paul changed ships at Patara on his final journey to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:1-Acts21:2\">Acts 21:1â€“2</a>).</p>",
