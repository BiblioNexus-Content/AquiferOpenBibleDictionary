    "content": "<h1>MERCY</h1><p>Mercy is a special quality of God that shows his faithful love. Through mercy, God keeps his promises to his people even when they fail or disobey him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:6\">Deuteronomy 30:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:1\">Isaiah 14:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek39:25-Ezek39:29\">Ezekiel 39:25–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:15-Rom9:16,Rom9:23\">Romans 9:15–16, 23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:32\">11:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:4\">Ephesians 2:4</a>).</p><h2>Understanding Mercy</h2><p>In the Bible, mercy has many different meanings because both Hebrew and Greek (the original languages of the Bible) used several words to describe it. When these words are translated into English, they can mean different things like:</p><ul><li><p>Kindness</p></li><li><p>Faithful love (or loving devotion)</p></li><li><p>Goodness</p></li><li><p>Grace (God&apos;s undeserved kindness)</p></li><li><p>Favor</p></li><li><p>Pity</p></li><li><p>Compassion (feeling concern for others)</p></li><li><p>Unchanging love</p></li></ul><p> An essential part of mercy is the desire to forgive people who have done wrong and to help them when they are in trouble.</p><h2>How God Shows Mercy</h2><p>Mercy comes from God&apos;s love for people. This love is shown freely in his actions to save those he has promised through his special covenant relationship. In the Old Testament, he chose the people of Israel to be his own and showed them mercy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:19\">Exodus 33:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:10\">Isaiah 54:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa63:9\">63:9</a>). God continues to accept his disobedient people and always tries to bring them back to himself. </p><p>The psalmist describes God as a father who cares for his children who respect and trust him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps103:13\">Psalm 103:13</a>). Hosea shows God as a loving father who looks down from heaven with great care for his rebellious people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos11:1-Hos11:12\">Hosea 11</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:20\">Jeremiah 31:20</a>). He also describes Israel as an unfaithful wife. God loves Israel as a faithful husband despite Israel&apos;s apostasy (turning away from God) and sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos3:5\">Hosea 1–3</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:4-Isa54:8\">Isaiah 54:4–8</a>). Isaiah describes God as a mother who cares for her child (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa49:15\">Isaiah 49:15</a>). </p><p>These pictures show God’s mercy in different ways. Other aspects of God&apos;s mercy include God accepting people back when they return to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:23\">2&nbsp;Kings 13:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:8\">Isaiah 54:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:18-Joel2:32\">Joel 2:18–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic7:18-Mic7:20\">Micah 7:18–20</a>). He also saves people from difficult situations and dangers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:19-Neh9:21\">Nehemiah 9:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps40:11-Ps40:17\">Psalms 40:11–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps69:16-Ps69:36\">69:16–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps79:8-Ps79:9\">79:8–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa49:10\">Isaiah 49:10</a>).</p><p>Because of what Israel learned about God&apos;s steady love and loyalty, devoted Jews naturally asked for God&apos;s mercy and forgiveness when in need. This is beautifully expressed in the psalms of sorrow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps6:1-Ps6:10\">Psalms 6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps32:1-Ps32:11\">32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps38:1-Ps38:22\">38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19\">51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps102:1-Ps102:28\">102</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps130:1-Ps130:8\">130</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps143:1-Ps143:12\">143</a>), as well as other Old Testament passages (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6\">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:17\">Nehemiah 9:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps57:1-Ps57:11\">Psalms 57</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps79:1-Ps79:13\">79</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps86:1-Ps86:17\">86</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps123:1-Ps123:4\">123</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa33:1-Isa33:6\">Isaiah 33:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:3-Dan9:19\">Daniel 9:3–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:13\">Joel 2:13</a>). Remembering God’s mercy gives those who are sorry hope that God will accept them again.</p><h2>Mercy in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, a very descriptive Greek word is used for Jesus’s mercy towards people in need (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:36\">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt14:14\">14:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:34\">20:34</a>). It&nbsp;shows his pity and care with a strong word that means “to be moved in one’s bowels.” The Hebrews thought the bowels or stomach were the center of feelings, especially kindness. Jesus was described as feeling deeply kind towards those in need and acting quickly to help their suffering. He healed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:34\">Matthew 20:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:41\">Mark 1:41</a>), brought the dead back to life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:13\">Luke 7:13</a>), and fed the hungry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:32\">Matthew 15:32</a>).</p><p>The Old Testament idea of God’s mercy shown in his chosen people is also found in the New Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:50,Luke1:54,Luke1:72,Luke1:78\">Luke 1:50, 54, 72, 78</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:4\">Ephesians 2:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:2\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3\">1&nbsp;Peter 1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:10\">2:10</a>). The most common use of mercy in the New Testament is God’s plan to save people through Jesus Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:30-Rom11:32\">Romans 11:30–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:4\">Ephesians 2:4</a>). God is “the Father of mercies” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:3\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:3</a>). He gives to those who believe in his Son. It is because he is “rich in mercy” that he saved those who are spiritually dead and doomed by their sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:6\">Ephesians 2:4–6</a>). It is because of God’s mercy that one is forgiven and given eternal life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:13-1Tim1:16\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:13–16</a>).</p><h2>People’s Responsibility to Show Mercy to Others</h2><p>Because God has given his kindness freely to all, whether they are good or not, people should be kind to others too. Even if they do not deserve it. In fact, people are told to be kind, especially to those who are poor, need help, or have lost family members (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov14:31\">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov19:17\">19:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic6:8\">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech7:9-Zech7:10\">Zechariah 7:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>). God thinks being kind is more important than following rules or offering sacrifices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:13\">Matthew 9:13</a>). God’s kindness through Jesus means people should treat others the way God has treated them. </p><p>Jesus made kindness and forgiveness a key part of his teaching (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:7\">Matthew 5:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:13\">9:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:7\">12:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:23\">23:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:36\">Luke 6:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:37\">10:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas3:17\">James 3:17</a>). Before he came, people talked about how kind he would be and how forgiveness would be the center of his mission (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:50,Luke1:54,Luke1:72,Luke1:78\">Luke 1:50, 54, 72, 78</a>).</p><p>Christians should care for each other and help each other, just as Jesus helped them. They should give help, love, and comfort to one another. James, one of Jesus&apos;s followers, says that doing good things is a very important part of real faith  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26\">James 2:14–26</a>). Jesus praised the good Samaritan who showed mercy. The good Samaritan helped a man who was hurt and robbed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:36-Luke10:37\">Luke 10:36–37</a>). Being full of mercy is a special quality of people who belong to God&apos;s kingdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:7\">Matthew 5:7</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4665\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">God, Being and Attributes of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4691\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Grace</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5954\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Love</span>.</p>",
