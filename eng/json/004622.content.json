Some scholars believe that the &quot;apples&quot; mentioned in the Old Testament were actually quinces, <em>Cydonia oblonga</em>.</p><p>The quince tree is quite common in the region of Palestine, though mainly as a cultivated tree rather than growing wild. It may be found growing naturally in the northern parts of Syria. The quince is native to northern Persia and Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).</p><p>The fruit is yellowish in color and has a strong, pleasant smell. It was this fragrance that made the quince highly valued by people in ancient times.</p>",
