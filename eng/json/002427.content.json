Like the foregoing references, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos10:11\">Hosea 10:11</a> speaks of harrowing in connection with plowing. Most probably harrowing consisted of branches being pulled behind an animal or plow to smooth the land and before seeding. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2592\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Agriculture</span>.</p>",
