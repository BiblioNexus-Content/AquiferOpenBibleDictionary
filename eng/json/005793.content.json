    "content": "<h1>WATER OF BITTERNESS OR JEALOUSY</h1><p>The water of bitterness was part of a &quot;trial&quot; used in ancient Israel when a husband suspected his wife of adultery but had no proof. This ceremony is described in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:11-Num5:31\">Numbers 5:11–31.</a> Some scholars think this belongs to a group of procedures called &quot;trials by ordeal.&quot; In these trials, the accused person had to face some physical challenge to determine if they were innocent or guilty. People believed that a higher power who knew the truth would control the outcome.</p><p>In ancient Israel, like many old societies, women had few rights. An Israelite husband could use this test when he had no proof of his wife being unfaithful but simply had a “spirit of jealousy” about her (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:11-Num5:14\">Numbers 5:11–14</a>). Most likely, a pregnant wife would be tested if her husband thought the baby might not be his.</p><p>The suspicious husband would bring his wife to the priest with a special offering of rough barley meal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:15\">Numbers 5:15</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:16\">Leviticus 2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev5:11\">5:11</a>). The priest would:</p><ol><li><p>Bring the woman to stand &quot;before the Lord&quot;</p></li><li><p>Mix &quot;holy water&quot; (probably from the tabernacle water basin) with dirt from the tabernacle floor</p></li><li><p>Untie the woman&apos;s hair (possibly to show shame)</p></li><li><p>Place some of the barley meal offering in her hands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:16-Num5:18\">Numbers 5:16–18</a>). </p></li></ol><p>Then the priest made her take an oath stating that if she had been unfaithful, drinking the &quot;water of bitterness&quot; would bring a curse upon her. She agreed by saying &quot;Amen, Amen&quot;(verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:19-Num5:22\">19–22</a>). After writing the words of the curse, the priest would wash them off into the water. After making a ceremonial offering of a handful of barley meal, the priest made the woman drink the water (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:23-Num5:26\">23–26</a>). If she was guilty, the result would be bitter suffering, causing the woman to become unable to have children (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:27\">27</a>).</p>",
