These verses refer to two places, Ain and Rimmon, but this was probably a scribal error for the one town, En-rimmon (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:7\">Jos 19:7</a>). It was resettled after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:29\">Neh 11:29</a>), and is perhaps the Rimmon south of Jerusalem mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:10\">Zechariah 14:10</a>. En-rimmon is thought to be the modern Khirbet Umm er-Rumamin, nine miles (14.5 kilometers) north of Beersheba.</p>",
