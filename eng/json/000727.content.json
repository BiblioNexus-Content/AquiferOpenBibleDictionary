    "content": "<h1>BAPTISM OF THE SPIRIT</h1><p>&quot;Baptism of the Spirit&quot; is a phrase that many people use when talking about Christian experiences. But, this exact phrase is not found in the Bible. Instead, the New Testament always uses phrases like &quot;baptize in the Spirit&quot; or &quot;baptized in the Spirit.&quot; These phrases describe an action or experience, which gives them a more active meaning than the noun phrase &quot;baptism of the Spirit.&quot;</p><h2>What Does &quot;Baptism of the Spirit&quot; Mean?</h2><p>The phrase seems to have been coined by John the Baptist. He said, &quot;<span>I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire</span>” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:11\">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:16\">Luke 3:16</a>; but <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:8\">Mark 1:8</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:33\">John 1:33</a> omit the words “and fire”). The phrase is clearly a metaphor. It stands in contrast to and as the fulfillment of John’s water baptism. It is a metaphor for <em>judgment.</em> The context in Matthew and Luke makes this clear. </p><h3>Cleansing and Judgment in Jewish Thought</h3><p>In Jewish thought, there were several familiar ideas about how God would cleanse or judge people:</p><ol><li><p>Cleansing by fire: People imagined being purified or destroyed by a river of fire.</p></li><li><p>Cleansing by spirit: They thought of being cleaned by a spirit.</p></li><li><p>Cleansing by God&apos;s breath: They pictured being purified by the fiery breath of God.</p></li></ol><p>It is important to know that in Hebrew, the words for &quot;breath&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; are the same. We can find these ideas in parts of the Bible like <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa4:4\">Isaiah 4:4</a>,  <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa30:27-Isa30:28\">Isaiah 30:27–28</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:10\">Daniel 7:10</a>. </p><p>This cleansing is not just about judgment. It is also about God&apos;s kindness. The process of cleaning, like separating wheat from unwanted parts, leads to something good. After the cleaning, the good grain (representing God&apos;s people) is safely stored (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:11-Matt3:12\">Matthew 3:11–12</a>). </p><p>It is also a metaphor for <em>initiation </em>or the start of something new.<em> </em>John the Baptist’s variation on “the messianic woes.” This is a way of describing the expectation that the messianic age when God&apos;s chosen leader (the Messiah) would rule. Many Jewish people believed that before the Messiah came, there would be a difficult period of suffering and troubles. This belief about hard times before the Messiah&apos;s coming is found in several places in the Bible and other ancient Jewish writings, such as:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:19-Dan7:22\">Daniel 7:19–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:1\">12:1</a> </p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:12-Zech14:15\">Zechariah 14:12–15</a></p></li><li><p>1&nbsp;Enoch 100:1–3</p></li></ul><h2>Baptism of the Spirit in the New Testament</h2><p>In the book of Acts, the metaphor continues to mean the start of something new, just as John the Baptist taught. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:4\">Acts 2:4</a> fulfills the promise of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:5\">Acts 1:5</a>. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was seen as <em>the</em> mark of “the last days” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:3\">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek39:29\">Ezekiel 39:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29\">Joel 2:28–29</a>). So, it was by being baptized in Spirit that the disciples <em>began</em> to experience the last days for themselves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:1-Acts2:7,Acts2:18\">Acts 2:1–7, 18</a>). </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:17\">Acts 11:17</a> speaks of Pentecost as the occasion when they came to believe in Jesus Christ as Lord. Similarly, the apostle Paul sees the gift of the Holy Spirit as the beginning of the Christian experience (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:22\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:3\">Galatians 3:3</a>). So “<span>if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:9\">Romans 8:9</a>). By being baptized in the Spirit, Cornelius and his friends received the forgiveness and salvation that Peter promised them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:43-Acts10:45\">Acts 10:43–45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:13-Acts11:18\">11:13–18</a>). “Baptized in Spirit” is there synonymous with “<span>granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:18\">11:18</a>) and “cleansed their hearts by faith” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:8-Acts15:9\">15:8–9</a>). <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3165\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Baptism</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3162\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Baptism of Fire</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7776\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Spiritual Gifts</span>.</p>",
