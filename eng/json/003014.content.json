KJV spelling of Jeiel, King Saul’s ancestor, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:35</a>. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5467\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jeiel #2</span>.</p><p>2. KJV spelling of Jeiel, Hotham’s son, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:44\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:44</a>. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5467\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jeiel #3</span>.</p><p>3. A Levite musician who, along with other Levites appointed by David, played a psaltery at the removal of the ark to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:18-1Chr15:20\">1&nbsp;Chr 15:18–20</a>). Afterward, he was appointed to a permanent ministry of music in the sanctuary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5\">1&nbsp;Chr 16:5</a>).</p><p>4. Levite of the family of Gershon; a chief of the house of Ladan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr23:8\">1&nbsp;Chr 23:8</a>, nlt mg). He was in charge of the temple treasury during David’s reign—an office that seems to have continued in the family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr29:8\">29:8</a>)—and founder of&nbsp;a priestly family called Jehieli or Jehielites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:21-1Chr26:22\">26:21–22</a>).</p><p>5. Hacmoni’s son who, with David’s uncle Jonathan (a&nbsp;counselor and a scribe), was appointed to take care of the king’s sons as a tutor and adviser (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:32\">1&nbsp;Chr 27:32</a>).</p><p>6. Son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, placed by his father over one of the fortified cities of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:2\">2&nbsp;Chr 21:2</a>). He and five brothers were slain by Jehoram when Jehoram became king.</p><p>7. One of the Kohathite Levites from the family of Heman who assisted in King Hezekiah’s reforms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14\">2&nbsp;Chr 29:14</a>, rsv “Jehuel”). He may be the same Levite who was assigned to oversee the reception and distribution of the sacred offerings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr31:13\">2&nbsp;Chr 31:13</a>).</p><p>8. One of the chief officers of the temple at the time of Josiah’s religious reformation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr35:8\">2&nbsp;Chr 35:8</a>); he contributed many sacrifices for the great Passover service.</p><p>9. Father of Obadiah from Joab’s house; he returned with Ezra from Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:9\">Ezr 8:9</a>).</p><p>10. One of the sons of Elam and father of Shecaniah. He&nbsp;was associated with Ezra’s marriage reforms (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:2\">Ezr 10:2</a>) and was perhaps the same Jehiel who was&nbsp;among those who divorced their foreign wives (v&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:26\">26</a>).</p><p>11. Priest who was among those Ezra persuaded to divorce their foreign wives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:21\">Ezr 10:21</a>).</p>",
