He is called a Paltite in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:26\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:26</a> and a Pelonite in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:27</a>. Most experts believe &quot;Paltite&quot; is the correct term, meaning he came from Bethpelet. Most scholars think he is the same person who was the officer in charge of the seventh group of soldiers during David&apos;s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:10\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:10</a>).</p></li><li><p>A descendant of Jerahmeel from the tribe of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:39\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:39</a>).</p></li></ol>",
