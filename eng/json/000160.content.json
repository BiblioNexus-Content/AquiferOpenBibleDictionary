    "content": "<h1>AGE</h1><p>A long period of time with no exact beginning or end. It can refer to the past or the future. </p><p>The Bible describes God as existing and planning &quot;before the ages&quot; (&quot;before time began&quot; in the Berean Standard Bible; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor2:7\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:7</a>). He is the King of ages (&quot;King eternal&quot; in the Berean Standard Bible; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:17\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:17</a>). He has an <span>eternal purpose</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph3:11\">Ephesians 3:11</a>). The Bible also talks about what God will do at the end of the age(s) (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:49\">Matthew 13:39</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:49\">49</a>).</p><p>The New Testament builds on earlier Jewish writings when it talks about two different time periods. There is &quot;the present age,&quot; which is seen as &quot;evil&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:4\">Galatians 1:4</a>). And there is &quot;the age to come&quot; when God will judge and set things right, and God&apos;s people will inherit their full blessing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:30\">Mark 10:30</a>). The Bible suggests we are now living at &quot;<span>the fulfillment of the age</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:11\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:11</a>). At the same time, we can experience some of &quot;the <span>powers of the coming age&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:5\">Hebrews 6:5</a>) and its life. This means that the future perfect age has started to overlap with the present age.</p><p>The word &quot;age&quot; is sometimes linked with &quot;generation.&quot; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:26\">Colossians 1:26</a> mentions a mystery hidden &quot;for ages and generations&quot; (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph3:21\">Ephesians 3:21</a>). However, the Bible does not divide time into periods with different ways to be redeemed. </p><p>Another related term is &quot;world.&quot; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:2\">Ephesians 2:2</a> describes unredeemed humanity as following &quot;<span>the ways of this world</span>.&quot; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:2\">Hebrews 1:2</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:3\">11:3</a> speak of God’s creation of the world.</p><p>The Bible also discusses human age, counted in years or other ways. Wisdom is often associated with the elderly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job12:12\">Job 12:12</a>). However, wisdom in old age is not guaranteed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl4:13\">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a>). Age should be respected (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:32\">Leviticus 19:32</a>). Long life is a blessing from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov16:31\">Proverbs 16:31</a>). Yet, old age is recognized as frail (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1-Eccl12:6\">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1-Eccl12:6\">6</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps90:10\">Psalm 90:10</a> says a human lifespan is typically 70 years, extending to 80 with &quot;<span>labor and sorrow</span>.&quot; </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4335\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Eternity</span>.</p>",
