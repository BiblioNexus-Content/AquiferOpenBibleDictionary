    "content": "<h1>WILDERNESS OF ZIN</h1><p>The wilderness of Zin is an area located in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. This is different from the wilderness of Sin, which is in the southern part of the peninsula. </p><p>The wilderness of Zin is one of the four or five &quot;wilderness&quot; areas found in the Sinai Peninsula. The other wilderness areas are: </p><ul><li><p>The wilderness of Paran (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:21\">Genesis 21:21</a>)</p></li><li><p>The wilderness of Shur (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:22\">Exodus 15:22</a>)</p></li><li><p>The wilderness of Sinai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num9:1\">Numbers 9:1</a>)</p></li><li><p>The wilderness of Sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:11\">Numbers 33:11</a>)</p></li></ul><p>The exact boundaries of these wilderness areas are not clearly defined. It is likely that some of these wilderness areas overlap with each other.</p><p>The wilderness of Zin is associated with the village of Zin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:4\">Numbers 34:4</a>). This wilderness area was located:</p><ul><li><p>West of Edom</p></li><li><p>Southwest of the Dead Sea</p></li><li><p>South of Judah</p></li></ul><p>Within this dry area were four large springs or oases, including Kadesh-barnea. The Israelites spent most of their 38 years in the Sinai Desert in this wilderness area. </p><p>Several important events from the Bible happened in the Wilderness of Zin:</p><ul><li><p>From the wilderness of Zin, the spies were sent to explore the land of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:1-Num13:26\">Numbers 13:1–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:8\">32:8</a>). </p></li><li><p>The people who rebelled against God were sentenced to die in this wilderness because of their unbelief (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:22-Num14:23\">Numbers 14:22–23</a>).</p></li><li><p>Moses sinned in this area by failing to give God credit for bringing water out of the rock (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:13\">Numbers 20:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:14\">27:14</a>).</p></li><li><p>Miriam, the sister of Moses, died and was buried here (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1\">Numbers 20:1</a>).</p></li></ul><p>The Bible describes this area as the “<span>vast and terrifying wilderness</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut1:19\">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:15\">8:15</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p>",
