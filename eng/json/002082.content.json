    "content": "<h1>GAD, Tribe of</h1><h2>The Beginning of the Tribe of Gad</h2><p>The Israelite tribe descended from Jacob’s seventh son, Gad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:11\">Genesis 30:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:24-Num1:25\">Numbers 1:24–25</a>). It was the eighth largest tribe among those that left Egypt with Moses, based on the number of warriors counted (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:1-Num1:3\">Numbers 1:1–3, 24–25</a>). The tribe was known for raising livestock and had a reputation for being fierce in battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1\">Numbers 32:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:20\">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>).</p><p>During the wilderness period, the tribe of Gad was led by Eliasaph, son of Deuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:14\">Numbers 1:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num2:14\">2:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:42\">7:42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:20\">10:20</a>). When the Israelites encamped, Gad was positioned south of the tabernacle, behind the tribes of Reuben and Simeon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num2:14-Num2:15\">Numbers 2:14–15</a>). The tribe is mentioned during the tribal offering to the tabernacle and in the aftermath of the plague that God brought upon Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:42-Num7:47\">Numbers 7:42–47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:15\">26:15, 18</a>). Geuel, the son of Maki, represented the tribe of Gad as one of the 12 spies sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:15\">Numbers 13:15</a>).</p><h2>The Territory of the Tribe of Gad</h2><p>As the Israelites approached the promised land, the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh asked to live east of the Jordan River. The land there was suitable for their livestock (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:2\">Numbers 32:1–2</a>). Moses granted this request on the condition that they would assist in the conquest of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:20-Num32:22\">Numbers 32:20–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:12-Josh1:18\">Joshua 1:12–18</a>). During the conquest under Joshua, the tribe of Gad is mentioned specifically at the battle of Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh4:12\">Joshua 4:12</a>). After the conquest, Gad, along with Reuben and half of Manasseh, settled in their land east of the Jordan River (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:13-Num34:14\">Numbers 34:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:6\">Joshua 12:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:8\">13:8</a>).</p><p>Gad’s inheritance was between the tribe of Manasseh to the north and the tribe of Reuben to the south. Its eastern border was the Arabian Desert, and its western border was the Jordan River. The region had no clearly defined borders between the two and a half tribes. The entire area was commonly referred to as Gilead and Bashan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:33\">2&nbsp;Kings 10:33</a>). Gad&apos;s territory extended north to the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) and south to the cities of Aroer and Heshbon, with the Jabbok River being the eastern border in the mountains (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:12-Deut3:13\">Deuteronomy 3:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:1-Josh12:6\">Joshua 12:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:24-Josh13:28\">13:24–28</a>).</p><h2>Gad&apos;s Interaction with Other Tribes</h2><p>The history of Gad, from its settlement to the Babylonian captivity, was closely tied to the tribes of Reuben and Manasseh. Shortly after settling in their land, these tribes nearly caused a civil war by building a large altar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh22:10-Josh22:34\">Joshua 22:10–34</a>). During the time of the judges, the Gadites, along with other inhabitants of Gilead, were threatened by the Ammonites until they were defeated by Jephthah (Judges 11). Some members of the tribe of Gad joined David at Ziklag during his exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:14\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:14, 37</a>). In the 14th year of David’s reign, Gad and the other two-and-a-half tribes were organized under an overseer named Jerijah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:30-1Chr26:32\">1 Chronicles 26:30–32</a>).</p><h2>Later History</h2><p>During the time of the divided kingdom, the tribes east of the Jordan were frequently attacked. During the reign of Jehu from 841 to 814 BC, the Aramean king Hazael took control of all the land east of the Jordan, including Gad&apos;s territory. Later, the Gadites were carried into captivity by Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr5:26-1Chr5:27\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 5:26–27</a>). Following this, the Ammonites occupied the land of Gad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer49:1\">Jeremiah 49:1</a>).</p><p>In the time after the exile in Babylon, Gad is mentioned only once, in Ezekiel’s vision of the restoration of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:1\">Ezekiel 48:1, 27–28, 34</a>). In the New Testament, the tribe of Gad is listed among the tribes sealed by God in the book of Revelation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:5\">Revelation 7:5</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4510\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Gad (Person) #1</span>.</p>",
