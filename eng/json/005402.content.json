This book is part of the Apocrypha, a collection of ancient religious texts included in the Bible by some Christian traditions but not by others. In the story, two respected community leaders falsely accuse Susanna of doing something wrong (committing adultery). The young prophet Daniel saves her by cleverly proving she is innocent.</p><p>The story is 64 verses long and shows how truth and justice win in the end. It has four main characters:</p><ul><li><p>Susanna, a beautiful woman who stays faithful to God</p></li><li><p>Daniel, a young prophet who finds out the truth</p></li><li><p>Two leaders who lie about Susanna because she refuses their evil demands</p></li></ul><p>The story is often called one of the first stories where someone solves a crime by finding clues and questioning witnesses.</p></li></ol>",
