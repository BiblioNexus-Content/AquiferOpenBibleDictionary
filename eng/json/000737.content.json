    "content": "<h1>BAR-JESUS</h1><p>A Jewish sorcerer and a “false prophet” (someone who falsely claimed to speak for God). He worked with the governor of Paphos on the island of Cyprus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:6\">Acts 13:6</a>). When the governor, Sergius Paulus, became interested in the message of Paul and Barnabas, Bar-Jesus tried to turn him away from their teachings. Paul confronted Bar-Jesus, calling him a &quot;son of the devil&quot; and predicting that he would be temporarily blinded as a punishment from God. Immediately, Bar-Jesus was struck with blindness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12\">Acts 13:7</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12\">12</a>). The governor seems to have converted to Christianity.</p><p>At that time, many people who easily believed in supernatural events were influenced by those who claimed to have special powers like Bar-Jesus (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11\">Acts 8:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11\">11</a>). The term &quot;sorcerer&quot; used for him meant more than just magician; it often referred to a wise man whose knowledge was thought to be greater than that of most others in society.</p><p>Bar-Jesus was also known by his Greek name, Elymas (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:8\">Acts 13:8</a>). Jewish people with connections to Greek culture often adopted Greek names. Some believe that Elymas comes from an Aramaic word for &quot;strong&quot; and an Arabic word for &quot;wise,&quot; which can also mean &quot;magician.&quot;</p>",
