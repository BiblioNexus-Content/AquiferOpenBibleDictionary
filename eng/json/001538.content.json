    "content": "<h1>DEBORAH</h1><p>The name of two women in the Old Testament. In Hebrew, Deborah means “honeybee” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps118:12\">Psalm 118:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:18\">Isaiah 7:18</a>).</p><ol><li><p>Rebekah’s nurse (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:8\">Genesis 35:8</a>). Deborah died as she was traveling to Bethel with her master Jacob’s household. She was buried in a spot known as <em>Allon-bacuth</em> (meaning &quot;the oak of weeping&quot;). It showed she was very loved. She was probably Rebekah’s longtime friend (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:59-Gen24:61\">Genesis 24:59</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:59-Gen24:61\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:59-Gen24:61\">61</a>).</p></li><li><p>A prophetess and judge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 4–5</a>). Deborah&apos;s role as a prophetess was to deliver God&apos;s message. As a judge, she was a leader of the Israelites. While other women acted as prophetesses in the Bible, it was not common. Other prophetesses included: </p><ul><li><p>Miriam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:20\">Exodus 15:20</a>) </p></li><li><p>Huldah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:14\">2&nbsp;Kings 22:14</a>)</p></li><li><p>Anna (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:36\">Luke 2:36</a>) </p></li></ul><p>Deborah was unique because she was already leading the people as a judge <em>before</em> the main events of her story happened (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:4\">Judges 4:4</a>). Her husband, Lappidoth, is otherwise unknown.</p><p>Deborah was celebrated as a “mother in Israel” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:7\">Judges 5:7</a>). She stayed in one location, and the people came to her for guidance. Over 200 years later, when Judges was written, a giant palm tree still marked the spot. Though she lived in the land of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:5\">Judges 4:5</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh16:2\">Joshua 16:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:13\">18:13</a>), Deborah was probably from the tribe of Ephraim, the most prominent tribe of northern Israel. But, some scholars say she came from the tribe of Issachar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14-Judg5:15\">Judges 5:14</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14-Judg5:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14-Judg5:15\">15</a>). At that time, the tribes were loosely organized. They did not always occupy their assigned territory.</p><p>Under Deborah&apos;s excellent leadership, the poorly equipped Israelites defeated the Canaanites in the plain of Esdraelon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:15\">Judges 4:15</a>). The flood of the Kishon River disrupted the enemy’s chariots (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:21-Judg5:22\">Judges 5:21</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:21-Judg5:22\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:21-Judg5:22\">22</a>). The Canaanites ran to the north, perhaps to Taanach near Megiddo (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:19\">Judges 5:19</a>). They never returned as enemies within Israel. The Song of Deborah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 5</a>) is a poetic version of the prose narrative in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24\">Judges 4</a>.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3170\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Barak</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3954\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Deborah, Song of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5658\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judges, Book of</span>.</p></li></ol>",
