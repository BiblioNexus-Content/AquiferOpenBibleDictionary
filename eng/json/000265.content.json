    "content": "<h1>ALOE</h1><p>The aloe is a plant found mostly in Africa that looks similar to a lily. Some types of aloe provide both medicine and fiber. In the Bible, aloe is mentioned with other fragrant plants like myrrh and balm (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:8\">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov7:17\">Proverbs 7:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:14\">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:39\">John 19:39</a>).</p><p>Most scholars believe these verses refer to two different plants: </p><ul><li><p>In the Old Testament, aloe likely refers to the eaglewood tree (<em>Aquilaria agallocha</em>). This large tree comes from northern India, Malaya, and Indochina. It can grow up to 36.6 meters (120 feet) tall with a trunk about 3.7 meters (12 feet) around. As its wood decays, it produces a strong fragrance. This makes it valuable for perfume, incense, and fumigation. In ancient times, people would burn fragrant woods to fill spaces with aromatic smoke.</p></li><li><p>In the New Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:39\">John 19:39</a>), aloe probably refers to the true aloe (<em>Aloe succotrina</em>). Egyptians used its bitter juice in the embalming process. Embalming is a process that preserves dead bodies. Though true aloe does not smell very pleasant, people sometimes used it as a medicine for horses.</p></li></ul>",
