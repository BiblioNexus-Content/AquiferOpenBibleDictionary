It is mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:6\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:6</a> in connection with the enthronement of Jehoash over Judah and the murder of Athaliah. Its parallel passage in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr23:5\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:5</a> reads the “Gate of the Foundation,” revealing perhaps a corruption within the Hebrew text.</p>",
