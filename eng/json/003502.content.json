Two writers in the early church, Irenaeus of Lyons and Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote that the apostles Peter and Paul chose Linus to be the bishop (church leader) of Rome. Eusebius identified him with the Linus that Paul refers to at the end of 2&nbsp;Timothy. He said that he served for 12 years as bishop. Other early church documents, including the <em>Apostolic Constitutions,</em> also say that this Linus was the one Paul mentioned in his letter.</p>",
