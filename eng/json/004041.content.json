    "content": "<h1>NAOMI</h1><p>The wife of Elimelech. She was the mother of Mahlon and Chilion. Naomi was a member of the tribe of Judah. She lived in Bethlehem during the time when judges ruled Israel. The book of Ruth tells her story. </p><p>Because of a severe famine in Canaan, Naomi resettled with her family in the land of Moab, east of the Dead Sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth1:1-Ruth1:2\">Ruth 1:1–2</a>). Her husband and two sons died in Moab (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth1:3-Ruth1:5\">3–5</a>). So, Naomi returned to Bethlehem with Ruth, her Moabitess daughter-in-law (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth1:8-Ruth1:22\">8–22</a>). When she reunited with her friends, she told them not to call her &quot;Naomi,&quot; which means “pleasant.” Instead, she told them to call her, &quot;Mara,&quot; which means “bitter.” Naomi said, “<span>I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty</span>” (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth1:20-Ruth1:21\">20–21</a>). Her family troubles were later resolved when Ruth married Boaz. Boaz was a close relative of Elimelech (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth2:1-Ruth4:22\">2–4</a>).</p>",
