He may have managed the treasuries of the temple in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:22\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:22</a>).</p><p>9. Pedaiah’s son, who served as the leader of the west half of Manasseh’s tribe during David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:20\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:20</a>)</p><p>10.
