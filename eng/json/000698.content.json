Bahurim is the modern-day Ras et-Temim. Palti lost his wife, Michal, there at Abner’s command when Michal was being returned to King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:16\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:16</a>). At Bahurim, Shimei cursed David and threw stones at him and his servants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5\">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:16\">19:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:8\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:8</a>). Jonathan and Ahimaaz, spying for David, were hidden from Absalom’s soldiers in a well there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:18\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:18</a>). One of David’s mighty men, Azmaveth, came from Bahurim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:31\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:33</a>).</p>",
