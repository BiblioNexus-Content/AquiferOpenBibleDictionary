    "content": "<h1>SIDON (Place), SIDONIAN</h1><p>A coastal city situated between Beirut and Tyre on the Phoenician coast, known as Zidon in the King James Version of the Bible.</p><p>Saida, the present town, is not a direct continuation of the ancient city. It is a development of post-Crusader times. The names Sidon and Sidonian appear 38 times in the Old Testament, and Sidon occurs 12 times in the New Testament.</p><p>The &quot;table of nations&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32\">Genesis 10</a>) can date Byblos (Gebal, Jebeil), Tyre, and Sidon. It names Sidon as Canaan&apos;s firstborn son, and Canaan was a son of Ham. The territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon to Gaza and east to the Cities of the Plain.</p><p>Sidon is 35.4 kilometers (22 miles) north of Tyre. They are often associated (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa23:1-Isa23:2\">Isaiah 23:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer47:4\">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:21-Matt11:22\">Matthew 11:21–22</a>). Both cities were very focused on trade and industry. Sidon was built on a headland that jutted into the sea toward the southwest. It had two harbors, the northern one having inner and outer ports. Sidon was also a center for the manufacture of the purple dye made from the Murex shellfish.</p><p>The Bible mentions Sidon several times in connection with the conquest of Palestine. Joshua defeated Jabin, king of Hazor, and pursued the enemy to &quot;Great Sidon&quot;(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:8\">Joshua 11:8</a>). Joshua also stated that the land of Israel included all of Lebanon, “even all the Sidonians” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:4-Josh13:6\">Joshua 13:4–6</a>). The tribal allotment of Asher extended as far north as “Sidon the Great” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:28\">Joshua 19:28</a>). But Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Sidon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:31\">Judges 1:31</a>).</p><p>The gods of Sidon are among the foreign deities that Israel served (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:6\">Judges 10:6</a>); David’s census included Sidon and Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:6-2Sam24:7\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:6–7</a>). During a famine in Ahab&apos;s time, the prophet Elijah was sent to a widow&apos;s home in Zarephath (Sarepta) in Sidon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:9\">1&nbsp;Kings 17:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:25-Luke4:26\">Luke 4:25–26</a>). Sidon is referred to often by the Hebrew prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa23:2,Isa23:4,Isa23:12\">Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:22\">Jeremiah 25:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer27:3\">27:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer47:4\">47:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:8\">Ezekiel 27:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel3:4\">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech9:2\">Zechariah 9:2</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus healed the daughter of a woman of that area (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28\">Matthew 15:21–28</a>). People came from as far away as Tyre and Sidon to hear Jesus and to be healed by him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:17\">Luke 6:17</a>). On his voyage to Rome to appear before Caesar, the ship stopped first at Sidon. There, the centurion, Julius, allowed Paul to visit friends ashore (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:3\">Acts 27:3</a>).</p>",
