    "content": "<h1>SHELUMIEL</h1><p>Shelumiel was a Simeonite (a person from the tribe of Simeon). He was the son of Zurishaddai and one of the leaders who helped Moses count the people of Israel in the wilderness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:6\">Numbers 1:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num2:12\">2:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:36,Num7:41\">7:36, 41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:19\">10:19</a>). According to the book of Judith, which is not in the Hebrew Bible but is accepted by some Christian groups, Shelumiel is an ancestor of Judith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt8:1\">Judith 8:1</a>, where his name is spelled Salamiel and his father&apos;s name is spelled Sarasadai).</p>",
