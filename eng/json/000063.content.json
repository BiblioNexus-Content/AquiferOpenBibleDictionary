It was located on the path that Nebuchadnezzarâ€™s general, Holofernes, took during his attack (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt2:24\">Judith 2:24</a>). </p><p>Some early scholars thought it with the biblical Jabbok (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:24\">Numbers 21:24</a>). Others called it the Cherbon, maybe because of a misreading of Habor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:6\">2&nbsp;Kings 17:6</a>).</p>",
