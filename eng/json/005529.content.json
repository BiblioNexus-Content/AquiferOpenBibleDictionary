    "content": "<h1>TERAPHIM*</h1><p>Idols associated with pagan magical rites. In the OT, the term is often translated “household gods,” indicative of talismans, which were kept in family shrines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:19,Gen31:34\">Gn 31:19, 34</a>). These were the idols that Rachel stole from her father and that occasioned Laban’s angry pursuit. Many have postulated that Laban’s anger reflects a Nuzian tradition where ownership of the household gods conferred inheritance rights to the owner. It is more likely that Rachel stole the teraphim simply to ensure good luck and safety.</p><p>Teraphim are also mentioned in connection with Micah’s attempt to establish a private priesthood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:5\">Jgs 17:5</a>). When the Danites moved to Laish, they stole Micah’s teraphim and ephod for oracular use (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:14-Judg18:20,Judg18:31\">18:14–20, 31</a>). Teraphim were typically small idols but on occasion could be life-size as well. David escaped from Saul when Michal placed a teraphim in his bed as a dummy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:13-1Sam19:16\">1&nbsp;Sm 19:13–16</a>). During Israel’s kingdom period, teraphim continued to be used in heretical cultic practices. Josiah attempted to rid the country of teraphim, wizards, and mediums, but his reforms appear to have been temporary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:24\">2&nbsp;Kgs 23:24</a>). The prophets regularly condemned the use of teraphim, identifying them with heathen abominations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek21:21\">Ez 21:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos3:4\">Hos 3:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech10:2\">Zec 10:2</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5154\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Idols, Idolatry</span>.</p>",
