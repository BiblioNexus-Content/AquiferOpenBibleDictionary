Boats were moved with oars (long sticks used to row) or sails (cloth that catches the wind).</p><p>Many of Jesusâ€™s followers were fishermen, so boats are mentioned often in the Gospels.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8083\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Travel</span>.</p>",
