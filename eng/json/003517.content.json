Her family, including Timothy’s mother, Eunice, lived at Lystra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1\">Acts 16:1</a>). Lois was a committed Jew. She appears to have converted to Christianity during Paul’s first missionary trip (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:28\">14</a>). Paul comments that Timothy shared the faith of his grandmother and mother.</p>",
