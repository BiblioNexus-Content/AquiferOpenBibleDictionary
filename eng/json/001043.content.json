It lists the names of people who honor and obey him.</p><p>The book is mentioned one time in the Old Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:16\">Malachi 3:16</a>). The prophet Malachi was speaking during a time when many people were turning away from God. Evil people were growing rich and proud. It looked like God was not doing anything about it.</p><p>Malachi said that God was still watching. God would remember those who stayed faithful. He would one day show the difference between the righteous and the wicked.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3467\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Book of Life</span>.</p>",
