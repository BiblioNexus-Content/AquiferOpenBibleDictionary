    "content": "<h1>CATERPILLAR</h1><p>Wormlike larva of a butterfly, moth, and some other insects. A larva is the young form of some insects that goes through a complete change before becoming an adult. Such insects pass through four stages:</p><ol><li><p>Egg</p></li><li><p>Larva</p></li><li><p>Pupa</p></li><li><p>Adult</p></li></ol><p>The caterpillar is the larval stage of insects. Bees, flies, moths, and butterflies all have a larval or caterpillar stage.</p><p>The word “caterpillar” occurs three times in certain translations, like the New Living Translation in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:37\">1&nbsp;Kings 8:37</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:28\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 6:28</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:46\">Psalm 78:46</a>. In the book of Joel, the same word is translated “locust” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel1:4\">Joel 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:25\">2:25</a>). The locust and grasshopper do not have a full transformation. They have only three stages: </p><ol><li><p>Egg</p></li><li><p>Nymph</p></li><li><p>Adult</p></li></ol><p>The nymph is a tiny adult. Its wings are not fully developed, though their outline may be present. There are several nymph stages known as instars. The reference to locust refers to the last instars. The wing structures are still folded and enclosed in a sac. But, they are recognizable. That form of the insect is about two and a half centimeters (one inch) long.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5934\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Locust</span>.</p>",
