    "content": "<h1>THEOPHILUS</h1><ol><li><p>A person to whom Luke wrote two books of the New Testament: the Gospel of Luke and Acts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:3\">Luke 1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:1\">Acts 1:1</a>). The name &quot;Theophilus&quot; means either &quot;lover of God&quot; or &quot;loved by God&quot; in Greek. Because of this meaning, some people think Theophilus might not be a real person&apos;s name. They suggest it could be a title used to address all readers of these books.</p><p>However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, the New Testament usually uses real names rather than titles when addressing people. Second, Luke calls Theophilus &quot;most excellent,&quot; a term of respect used for important officials. For example, Paul used this same title when speaking to Festus, and both Claudius Lysias and Tertullus used it when addressing Felix (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:26\">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3\">24:2</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3\">â€“</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3\">3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts26:25\">26:25</a>). </p><p>While Theophilus was probably an important person in society, we do not know exactly what position he held.</p></li><li><p>The Jewish high priest from AD 37 to 41. He came from an important religious family. His father was Annas, his brother was Jonathan, and his brother-in-law was Caiaphas. Vitellius, who ruled the area for Rome, made Theophilus the high priest after Jonathan. King Herod Agrippa later removed Theophilus from this position.</p><p>This Theophilus was probably the high priest who gave Paul permission to arrest Christians. Though he played this important role, his name does not appear in the New Testament.</p></li></ol>",
