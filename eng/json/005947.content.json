Though its exact location remains in question, Zered is probably identifiable with the modern Wadi el-Hesa, a streambed that formed a natural border between the ancient countries of Moab and Edom and, following a northwestward course, emptied into the southern end of the Dead Sea. The crossing of the Zered Brook by the Israelites marked 38 years since Israel rebelled against God at Kadesh-barnea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:13-Deut2:14\">Dt 2:13â€“14</a>).</p>",
