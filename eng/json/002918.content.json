    "content": "<h1>JAEL</h1><p>Wife of Heber. Though her husband was from the Kenite tribe, a longtime ally of Israel, he had chosen to side with Jabin, the Canaanite king. Jael demonstrated her loyalty to Israel, Jabin’s enemy, however, by inviting Sisera, Jabin’s general, into her tent, giving him milk instead of water, providing him a place to sleep, and then driving a tent peg into his temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:17-Judg4:18,Judg4:21-Judg4:22\">Jgs 4:17–18, 21–22</a>). Deborah, the inspired poetess, reflecting on the God-given victory over the Canaanites, praises Jael for this deed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:6,Judg5:24-Judg5:31\">5:6, 24–31</a>).</p>",
