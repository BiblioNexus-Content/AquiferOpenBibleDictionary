It was settled by Semitic nomads (wandering people) who adopted city life and adapted cuneiform (an ancient writing system) to their own language, Akkadian.</p><p>Mari was an outpost of the Sumerian civilization. It was significant because it was the capital of an empire extending over a great part of northern Mesopotamia, about 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) along the Euphrates River.</p><p>Archaeologists have found over 20,000 documents at Mari.

These items tell us a lot about life from 1810 to 1760 BC.</p><p>Mari was surrounded by a great defensive wall, protecting it from invading forces. One prominent building, a ziggurat (temple tower), rose high above the town, about 150 feet (45.6 meters) high. It was a tall pyramid with outside stairs leading to a shrine at the top and smaller temples at the base.</p><p>The royal palace was on about six acres (2.4 hectares) of land.
