Korah, Dathan, and Abiram led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron. It ended with the deaths of many Korahites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:31-Num16:35\">Numbers 16:31–35</a>). Only those who did not participate in the rebellion survived (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:11\">Numbers 16:11</a>). They settled around Hebron in areas set aside for the Levites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:58\">Numbers 26:58</a>).</p><p>The Korahites were known as temple singers, according to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps42:1-Ps42:11\">Psalms 42</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps44:1-Ps49:20\">44–49</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps84:1-Ps85:13\">84–85</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps87:1-Ps88:18\">87–88</a>. David put them in charge of the musical service in the Lord&apos;s house after the ark of the covenant was brought to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:31–33</a>). They also acted as gatekeepers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:19\">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:19\">26:19</a>). They baked cakes used in sacrifices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:31\">1 Chronicles 9:31</a>). They are mentioned as singers in the celebration of Jehoshaphat&apos;s victory over Ammon and Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:19\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:19</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5812\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Korah #3</span>.</p>",
