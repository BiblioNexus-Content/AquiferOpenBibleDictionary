    "content": "<h1>AARON</h1><p>Moses’s brother and Israel’s first high priest. He was Moses’s representative and helper during Israel&apos;s exodus from Egypt. </p><h2>Aaron&apos;s Early Life and Family</h2><p>Aaron was three years older than Moses and was 83 when they first approached the pharaoh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod7:7\">Exodus 7:7</a>). Their sister, Miriam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:59\">Numbers 26:59</a>), was the eldest, old enough to send messages when the infant Moses was found by the pharaoh’s daughter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod2:9\">Exodus 2:1–9</a>). Aaron’s parents were Jochebed and Amram, who belonged to the Kohath family within the tribe of Levi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:18-Exod6:20\">Exodus 6:18–20</a>).</p><p>Aaron and his wife, Elisheba, had four sons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:23\">Exodus 6:23</a>), who were to follow him as priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:5\">Leviticus 1:5</a>). Two of them, Nadab and Abihu, disobeyed God by performing an improper act while burning incense and were killed by fire as a result (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:5\">Leviticus 10:1–5</a>). The priesthood continued through Aaron’s other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, who also occasionally failed to follow God’s instructions correctly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:6-Lev10:20\">Leviticus 10:6–20</a>).</p><h2>Important Events in Aaron’s Life</h2><h3>The Exodus from Egypt</h3><p>Aaron’s importance during the exodus was partly due to his relationship with Moses. When Moses tried to avoid leading Israel because of a speech impediment, God chose Aaron, who was a skilled speaker, to assist him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:10-Exod4:16\">Exodus 4:10–16</a>).</p><p>Aaron was born while the Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt. Moses, raised as an Egyptian by the pharaoh’s daughter, fled to the Midian Desert after killing an Egyptian taskmaster (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod2:25\">Exodus 1–2</a>). When God sent Moses back to Egypt to free the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod4:31\">Exodus 3–4</a>), Aaron was sent to meet him in the desert (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:27\">Exodus 4:27</a>). Since Moses had been away for many years, Aaron connected with Israel’s elders on Moses’ behalf (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:29-Exod4:31\">Exodus 4:29–31</a>). Together, they confronted the pharaoh, delivering God’s command to release the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1\">Exodus 5:1</a>). When the pharaoh made life harder for the Hebrew slaves, God began to demonstrate his power through a series of miracles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod12:51\">Exodus 5–12</a>). Aaron, using a rod (likely a shepherd’s staff), performed the first three miracles. After a plague of gnats (sometimes translated as “lice”) affected all of Egypt, the pharaoh’s magicians admitted defeat, saying, “This is the finger of God!” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod8:19\">Exodus 8:19</a>). God then brought further plagues through Moses, leading to the death of all firstborn Egyptian sons. Aaron was with Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:28\">Exodus 12:1–28</a>) when God revealed the Passover, where the marked homes of the Israelites were spared from death. This event is the origin of the Passover feast still celebrated by Jews today (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod13:1-Exod13:16\">Exodus 13:1–16</a>).</p><h3>Wandering in the Wilderness</h3><p>After God safely led the Israelites out of Egypt and destroyed the pursuing Egyptians, Aaron helped Moses govern the people during their long journey to the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:6\">Exodus 16:1–6</a>). In a battle against Amalek’s army, Aaron supported Moses by holding up his weary arms in prayer, ensuring God’s blessing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:16\">Exodus 17:8–16</a>). Although Aaron was always second to Moses, he was recognized as an important leader (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:12\">Exodus 18:12</a>). God called Aaron to join Moses when he gave the law on Mount Sinai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:24\">Exodus 19:24</a>). Aaron was among the leaders who confirmed God’s laws in the Book of the Covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:8\">Exodus 24:1–8</a>). He accompanied these leaders partially up the holy mountain and saw a vision of the God of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:9-Exod24:10\">Exodus 24:9–10</a>). Along with Hur, Aaron was left in charge while Moses was with God on the mountaintop (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:13-Exod24:14\">Exodus 24:13–14</a>).</p><p>When Moses was away for over a month, Aaron gave in to the people&apos;s demand for an idol. He melted their gold jewelry and made a golden calf (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:4\">Exodus 32:1–4</a>). (The Israelites may have been influenced by Egypt’s worship of Apis, a fertility god in the form of a bull.) At first, Aaron seemed to think he was doing something acceptable to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:5\">Exodus 32:5</a>). Still, things quickly got out of control, leading to a wild, immoral celebration around the idol (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:6\">Exodus 32:6</a>). God was so angry that he considered destroying the people. Still, Moses interceded, reminding God of his promise to Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:7-Exod32:14\">Exodus 32:7–14</a>). Moses confronted Aaron about idolatry and immorality, but Aaron blamed the people instead of admitting his guilt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:21-Exod32:24\">Exodus 32:21–24</a>). The idolaters were punished by death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:25-Exod32:28\">Exodus 32:25–28</a>), and the entire camp was struck by a plague (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:35\">Exodus 32:35</a>). Although Aaron was in great danger, he was spared because Moses prayed for him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut9:20\">Deuteronomy 9:20</a>).</p><p>In their second year of wandering, Aaron assisted Moses in taking a census (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:1-Num1:3\">Numbers 1:1–3, 17–18</a>). Later, Aaron may have become jealous of Moses’s leadership, as both he and Miriam began to speak against their brother, even though Moses was now the most humble man on earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:4\">Numbers 12:1–4</a>). Moses’s prayer turned away God’s anger, but Miriam suffered for her actions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:5-Num12:15\">Numbers 12:5–15</a>). Once again, Aaron was not punished. Aaron also supported Moses against rebellions at Kadesh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:5\">Numbers 14:1–5</a>) and later in the wilderness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50\">Numbers 16</a>). After a final incident at Meribah, where the Israelites almost rebelled again, God accused Moses and Aaron of not trusting him fully and denied them entry into the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:12\">Numbers 20:1–12</a>). Aaron died at the age of 123 on Mount Hor after Moses removed his priestly clothes and gave them to Aaron’s son Eleazar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:23-Num20:29\">Numbers 20:23–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:38-Num33:39\">33:38–39</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4375\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Exodus, The</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5902\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Levi, Tribe of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2430\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Aaron’s Rod</span>.</p>",
