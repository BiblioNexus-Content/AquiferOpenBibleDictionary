    "content": "<h1>EN-ROGEL</h1><p>En-rogel is a spring (natural water source) near Jerusalem. En-rogel marked part of the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:7\">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:16\">18:16</a>). </p><p>Jonathan and Ahimaaz once hid at En-rogel while spying on Absalom’s army for King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:17</a>). A servant girl carried their message from the spring to the king. Later, Adonijah offered sacrifices there when he tried to make himself king before David died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:9</a>).</p><p>Some think En-rogel was a spring in a cave near Siloam, on the west side of the Kidron Valley. This spring is called the Virgin’s Fount. However, many scholars believe this spring is actually the Gihon Spring (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:33\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:33</a>), which the Bible treats as a different place. A better suggestion is that En-rogel was a spring south of Jerusalem, known today as the Well of Job.</p>",
