    "content": "<h1>SEA OF GLASS</h1><p>A body of water in the vision of heaven described by John in the book of Revelation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:6\">Rv 4:6</a>). It appears again later, in a different vision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev15:2\">15:2</a>), and is perhaps connected with other “sea” references in the same book (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:1\">13:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1\">21:1</a>). It probably depicts the vast expanse before God’s throne. The crystal clearness of this sea may symbolize that everything is translucent and revealed in the presence of God.</p>",
