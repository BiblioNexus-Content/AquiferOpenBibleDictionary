    "content": "<h1>MIZPAH</h1><p>A Hebrew name meaning, “watchtower” (also spelled &quot;Mizpeh&quot;). Mizpah designates at least six different locations mentioned in the Old Testament and Apocrypha (<span>a set of ancient texts not included in the Hebrew Bible but accepted by some Christian groups)</span>.</p><ol><li><p>A place in Gilead where Jacob and Laban made a covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:49\">Genesis 31:49</a>). They set up a heap of stones to mark the borders between their territories.</p></li><li><p>A place referred to as “the land of Mizpah” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:3\">Joshua 11:3</a>) or the “valley of Mizpah” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:8\">Joshua 11:8</a>). It was near Mount Hermon and the Hivites lived there.</p></li><li><p>A town in Judah near Lachish referred to in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:38\">Joshua 15:38</a>.</p></li><li><p>A place in the tribal area of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:26\">Joshua 18:26</a>). The Israelites gathered here to war against the tribe of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:1\">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg21:1\">21:1</a>). This was after the men of Gibeah had abused and killed the concubine of a visiting Levite. It was here that Samuel called all Israel together to pray for victory over the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam7:5-1Sam7:8\">1&nbsp;Samuel 7:5–8</a>). Later, Samuel called for an assembly at Mizpah to declare Saul as king to the people. Here he also instructed the people and king in the ways of the kingdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:17-1Sam10:25\">10:17–25</a>). </p><p>In the time of King Asa, Mizpah was a fortified town on the border between Israel and Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:22\">1&nbsp;Kings 15:22</a>). After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, Mizpah became the residence of Gedaliah the governor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23-2Kgs25:24\">2&nbsp;Kings 25:23–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer40:10\">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Ishmael of the “royal seed” killed Gedaliah there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:3\">Jeremiah 41:3</a>). Two days later, Ishmael murdered a group of travelers who were going to Jerusalem. These people were bringing their offerings to the ruined temple. He threw their bodies into a cistern that Asa had constructed centuries earlier.</p><p>In the period between the Old Testament and New Testament, Mizpah continued to&nbsp;be an important religious center. Judas Maccabeus called the people together at Mizpah, “because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:46\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 3:46</a>).</p></li><li><p>The home of Jephthah. From here he led the Israelites in&nbsp;battle against the Ammonites. He returned here to carry out his vow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:1-Judg11:40\">Judges 10–11</a>). It is possible that this is the same place as the Ramath-mizpeh of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:26\">Joshua 13:26</a>. Many identify it with Khirbat Jal’ad, south of the Jabbok.</p></li><li><p>A town in Moab to which David fled from Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:3\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:3</a>).</p></li></ol>",
