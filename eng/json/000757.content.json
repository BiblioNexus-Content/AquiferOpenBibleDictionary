    "content": "<h1>BASKAMA</h1><p>A site where Trypho, commander of the Seleucid army, killed his captive, Jonathan Maccabeus. Trypho was holding Jonathan hostage, and when Jonathan was no longer useful, Trypho killed him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc12:42-1Macc13:23\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 12:42–13:23</a>). </p><p>It is unclear where Baskama is located. The most popular suggestion is modern-day Tell el-Jummeizeh (“sycamore tree”), which is near the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee. El-Jummeizeh might be related to Baskama, which can mean “house of the sycamore.” Ancient ruins there might have been a shrine to Jonathan, a great hero. The Jewish historian Josephus calls the spot Basaca.</p>",
