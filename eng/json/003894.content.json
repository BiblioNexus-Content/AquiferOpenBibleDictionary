    "content": "<h1>MIRIAM</h1><ol><li><p>A daughter of Amram and Jochebed and the sister of Aaron and Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:20\">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:59\">Numbers 26:59</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:3</a>). Miriam first appears in Scripture as a young girl. Her task was to watch her infant brother&apos;s cradle, hidden in the reeds of the Nile River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:4\">Exodus 2:4</a>). Her parents made a plan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:23\">Hebrews 11:23</a>) to escape the pharaoh&apos;s command to drown of all Hebrew males at birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:22\">Exodus 1:22</a>). Miriam shows courage, concern, and wisdom when the Egyptian princess finds her brother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:5-Exod2:6\">Exodus 2:5–6</a>). She takes the initiative and offers to find a nurse for the child. When they accept her plan, she gets her mother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:7-Exod2:8\">Exodus 2:7–8</a>).</p><p>Miriam first appears by name after the Israelites have crossed the Red Sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:20\">Exodus 15:20</a>). She is called a &quot;prophetess&quot; and, along with her brothers, was appointed as a leader of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic6:4\">Micah 6:4</a>). After the Egyptian army drowned in the sea, she led the women of Israel in a song of praise with dancing and musical instruments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:21\">Exodus 15:21</a>).</p><p>Later, Miriam brought shame upon herself when she became jealous of Moses. Together with Aaron, she complained against Moses because of his greater influence among the people and because he had married a Cushite woman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:2\">Numbers 12:1–2</a>). Because of this attack against God&apos;s chosen leader, Miriam was struck with leprosy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:10\">Numbers 12:10</a>). Moses, however, prayed for her healing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:9-Num12:13\">Numbers 12:9–13</a>). She was restored to health, bbut only after spending seven shameful days outside the camp while all of Israel waited to continue their journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:14-Num12:15\">Numbers 12:14–15</a>). This sad event is the last recorded event in Miriam’s public life. She died near the end of the wilderness wanderings at Kadesh and was buried there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:1\">Numbers 20:1</a>).</p></li><li><p>A child of Mered, who was a descendant of Ezra from the tribe of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:17\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</a>).</p></li></ol>",
