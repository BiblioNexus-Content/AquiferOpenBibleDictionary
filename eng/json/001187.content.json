    "content": "<h1>CASPIN</h1><p>Caspin was a town east of the Jordan River. It was probably the same place as Chaspho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:26,1Macc5:36\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:26, 36</a>). Ancient and modern experts do not fully agree on the location. The Jewish historian Josephus identifies Caspin with Maked (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc12:13\">2&nbsp;Maccabees 12:13</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:24-1Macc5:36\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:24–36</a>, Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus led their army into the region called Transjordan (across the Jordan River). There Judas “took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilead” (verse&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:36\">36</a>, Revised Standard Version).</p>",
