The range extends into eastern Turkey, southern Georgia, and northern Iran. According to the Bible, Noah&apos;s ark landed on these mountains when the flood waters began to go down (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen8:4\">Genesis 8:4</a>). Many people have searched this remote area, hoping to find the ark.</p><p>We do not know the exact location of a single Mount Ararat. However, there is a traditional location between Lake Van and Lake Urmia, in what was once called Urartu (an ancient name similar to &quot;Ararat&quot;). This area was once part of Assyria. The land around it is a high plain with very few plants, very few people living there, and empty fields of hardened lava. One mountain peak in this area is called Agri Dagh, which means &quot;Mountain of Trouble&quot; in Turkish. It is 5,180 meters (17,000 feet) high. Local people call it Kohl Nu, which means &quot;Mount of Noah.&quot; Because of this name, most people looking for Noah&apos;s ark search in this area. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6581\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Noah #1</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4448\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Flood, The</span>.</p>",
