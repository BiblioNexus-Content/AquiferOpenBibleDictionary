This city was probably the same place as Ephraim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23\">2&nbsp;Samuel 13:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr13:19\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:19</a>, where it is called “Ephron”; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:54\">John 11:54</a>). Most scholars think this city is now the town called <em>et-Taiyibeh</em>, which is eight kilometers (five miles) north of Michmash and six and a half kilometers (four miles) northeast of Bethel.</p></li><li><p>A city in Manasseh that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. He was the father of the judge Gideon. Gideon lived in this city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:11\">Judges 6:11</a>). An angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon at Ophrah. The angel told Gideon to rescue Israel from the Midianites (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:12-Judg6:24\">12–24</a>). </p><p>After Gideon won the battle, the people wanted him to be king. But he refused. Instead, he made an ephod (a special garment used by priests) from the gold he had taken in the battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:22-Judg8:28\">Judges 8:22–28</a>). Sadly, the people began to worship this object as an idol. It became a problem for Gideon and his family.</p><p>Gideon died in Ophrah as an old man (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:29-Judg8:32\">29–32</a>). Later, Gideon’s son Abimelech wanted to become king. He killed his 70 brothers at Ophrah so he could rule. Only one brother, Jotham, escaped (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:6\">9:1–6</a>).</p></li></ol>",
