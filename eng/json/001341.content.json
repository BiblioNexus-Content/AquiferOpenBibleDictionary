This letter is probably the earliest Christian writing outside the New Testament. Dionysius of Corinth, who was bishop around AD 170, was the first to identify Clement as the author of that letter. Origen, a theologian who lived in Alexandria, and Eusebius, the first church historian, identified the writer as the Clement listed in the <em>Shepherd of Hermas. </em>The <em>Shepherd of Hermas</em> is a Christian writing from the mid-second century.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3757\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Clement, Epistle of</span>.</p>",
