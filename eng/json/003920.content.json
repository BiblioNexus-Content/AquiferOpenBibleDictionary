Yet, some scholars suggest that Mizraim refers to a site either on the Edomite border or in northern Syria. </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:6\">Genesis 10:6</a> identifies Mizraim (Egypt) as one of the sons of Ham who settled south of Canaan. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:14\">Genesis 10:14</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:11\">Isaiah 11:11</a> distinguish Mizraim from Pathrushim (Upper Egypt). Upper Egypt is the southern half of the United Kingdom of Egypt. There are almost 700 known references to Mizraim. Yet, in the majority of references, there is no distinction between the two parts of the kingdom. The term refers to the Egyptian territory.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4122\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Egypt, Egyptian</span>.</p>",
