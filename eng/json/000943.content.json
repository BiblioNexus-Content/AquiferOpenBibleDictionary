    "content": "<h1>BETH-ZUR</h1><p>A hill town of Judah in the mountains north of Hebron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:58\">Joshua 15:58</a>). Beth-zur was built by Maon, one of Caleb’s descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:45\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:45</a>), and was a natural stronghold of Judah. It was defended by King Rehoboam of the southern kingdom in the 10th century BC, even though it was already less important (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:7\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:7</a>). It was a political center during the time of Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:16\">Nehemiah 3:16</a>). In the Maccabean period it was known by the Greek name Bethsura. Judas Maccabeus defeated Syrian general Lysias there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc4:29,1Macc4:61\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 4:29, 61</a>) and lost the town a few years later. After recapturing Beth-zur from the Syrians, Simon Maccabeus strengthened it in 140 BC, making it one of the most important fortresses on the border between Judah and Idumea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66\">1 Maccabees 11:65</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66\">66</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc14:33\">14:33</a>).</p>",
