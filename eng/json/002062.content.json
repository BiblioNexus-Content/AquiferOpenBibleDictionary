It was the fuller’s job to prepare fibers used for weaving by cleansing them of oil and other impurities. The cleansing materials the fuller used were white clay, urine, and ashes of special plants. The fuller’s plant lay outside the town because of offensive odors and because space was needed for spreading the fibers to dry, as was the case of the Fuller’s Field outside Jerusalem in Isaiah’s day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:17\">2&nbsp;Kgs 18:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:3\">Is 7:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa36:2\">36:2</a>).</p>",
