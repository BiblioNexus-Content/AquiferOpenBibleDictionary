A raised walkway or water channel (called an aqueduct) led to it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:17\">2&nbsp;Kings 18:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:3\">Isaiah 7:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa36:2\">36:2</a>). Many scholars think it was close to En-rogel, a spring also called “spring of the fuller.” A fuller was someone who cleaned and prepared cloth, especially wool.</p><p>En-rogel was in the Kidron Valley, south of Jerusalem. In Bible times, it marked the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:7\">Joshua 15:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:16\">18:16</a>). When Absalom rebelled against King David, David ran away from Jerusalem. Two of his helpers stayed at En-rogel to gather news about the rebellion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:17</a>).</p><p>En-rogel is often identified with a deep well called Bir Attub, or “Job’s Well.” This well reaches down into the rock and brings up water after it rains.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5501\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jerusalem</span>.</p>",
