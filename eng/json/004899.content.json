    "content": "<h1>SCEPTER</h1><p>A scepter is a special staff that kings and rulers used to show their power. It was typically a long stick with decorative designs at the top. Kings would hold these scepters during important ceremonies to show they were in charge. Sometimes, a shorter version of the scepter was used as a weapon in battle, which also symbolized a ruler&apos;s military strength.</p><p>In the Bible, the scepter appears in many stories as a symbol of royal authority and military power. </p><p>Examples of the scepter as a symbol of royal authority include:</p><ul><li><p>When Jacob blessed his sons, he said Judahâ€™s descendants would have royal authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:10\">Genesis 49:10</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:6\">Psalm 45:6 </a>and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:8\">Hebrews 1:8</a>).</p></li><li><p>The prophet Amos refers to the royal authority of the kings of Syria and Philistia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:5,Amos1:8\">Amos 1:5, 8</a>).</p></li><li><p>The prophet Zechariah refers to the royal authority of Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech10:11\">Zechariah 10:11</a>).</p></li><li><p>King Ahasuerus (also called Xerxes) held out a scepter (a symbol of his royal authority) to Esther (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth4:11\">Esther 4:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth5:2\">5:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth8:4\">8:4</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Examples of the scepter as a symbol of military power include:</p><ul><li><p>The book of Numbers talks about a scepter that would belong to God&apos;s chosen king (the Messiah) who was promised to come in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num24:17\">Numbers 24:17</a>).</p></li><li><p>The prophet Isaiah talks about how God would break Babylon&apos;s scepter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:5\">Isaiah 14:5</a>).
