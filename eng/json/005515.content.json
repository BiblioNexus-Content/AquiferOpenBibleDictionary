    "content": "<h1>TEMA (Place)</h1><p>Tema was a town generally identified with Teima&apos;. This place was an oasis located 321.8 kilometers (200 miles) north of Medina and 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) south of Dumah. Teimaâ€™ was on an ancient caravan route that connected the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Aqaba. This means it was an important stop for traders traveling through the desert.</p><p>In the writings of the prophets, Tema is mentioned together with Dedan and Buz as Arabian oases that would not escape God&apos;s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa21:14\">Isaiah 21:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:23\">Jeremiah 25:23</a>). The passage in Jeremiah contains a reference to the residents of Dedan, Tema, and Buz being among those who &quot;cut the corners of their hair.&quot;</p><p>The practice of cutting the corners of the hair would make them different from the Jewish people. Jews left the corners of their hair uncut (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:27\">Leviticus 19:27</a>). Like uncircumcision, the practice of cutting the corners of the hair would identify the men of Tema as non-Jewish people who followed other religions.</p>",
