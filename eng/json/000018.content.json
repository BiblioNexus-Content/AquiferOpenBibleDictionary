    "content": "<h1>ABEL (Place)</h1><p>A strong city on the border of upper Galilee in northern Israel.</p><p>The leader of King David&apos;s army, Joab, chased a man named Sheba to Abel. Sheba was fighting against David. A wise woman from Abel talked with Joab. After their talk, the people of Abel killed Sheba and threw his head over the city wall. Then Joab stopped attacking the city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:13-2Sam20:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:13</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:13-2Sam20:22\">22</a>). </p><p>Later, the city was conquered by the Syrian King Ben-hadad during a war between King&nbsp;Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel. When Asa persuaded Ben-hadad to break his agreement with Baasha, Ben-hadad took a large amount of land, including Abel, called Abel-beth-maacah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:16-1Kgs15:20\">1&nbsp;Kings 15:16</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:16-1Kgs15:20\">20</a>). </p><p>Sometime later, Tiglath-pileser III took Abel-beth-maacah, also called Abel of Beth-maacah, or Abel of Beth-maachah. The people who lived there were taken as prisoners to&nbsp;Assyria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</a>). </p><p>Abel is sometimes called Abel-maim (“meadow of water”). The name shows the city was surrounded by fertile land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:4\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 16:4</a>). The town has been identified with modern Tell Abil-el-Qamh.</p>",
