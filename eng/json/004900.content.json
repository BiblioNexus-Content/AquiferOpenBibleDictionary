The sons of Sceva tried to copy Paul by driving out evil spirits in the name of Jesus. However, their attempts at exorcism failed because their authority was not recognized. So, the evil spirits attacked and hurt these sons of Sceva who had tried to rebuke them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:14\">Acts 19:14</a>).</p>",
