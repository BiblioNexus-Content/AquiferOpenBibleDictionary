The name Machbenah appears in a list with other geographical locations. It is listed before Gibea, which is probably the same town mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:57\">Joshua 15:57</a>. This suggests that Machbenah was likely located in the eastern part of the hill country south of Hebron. This area was known to be inhabited by the descendants of Caleb.</p>",
