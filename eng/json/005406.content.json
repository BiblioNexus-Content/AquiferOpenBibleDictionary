The barn swallow (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>) is the most common type. Swallows have small, weak feet and cannot walk well. Swallows are similar to swifts in shape and life habits but are somewhat smaller.</p><p>The swallow has a large mouth that helps it catch insects while flying. Its feathers can be brown, blue, or white. Swallows often make nests inside buildings. The psalmist once spoke about seeing a swallow’s nest at the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps84:3\">Psalm 84:3</a>).</p><p>Swallows usually live year-round in Israel. This is different from swifts, which migrate on a regular schedule. The word “swallow” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa38:14\">Isaiah 38:14</a> probably means “swift.” In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer8:7\">Jeremiah 8:7</a>, the writer compares the swift’s regular migration with the unfaithfulness of God’s people. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov26:2\">Proverbs 26:2</a> may refer to either the swallow or the swift.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3418\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Birds</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"212871\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Swift</span>.</p>",
