The Babylonians spelled his name as &quot;Nabu,&quot; while the Hebrew Bible spells it as &quot;Nebo.&quot; He was considered the son of Marduk, who was the chief god of Babylon.</p><p>Nebo was known as the god of wisdom, education, and writing. He first served as the main god of a city called Borsippa. As the Babylonian Empire grew larger, more people began to worship Nebo.</p><p>Many ancient writings show that the kings of Babylon and Assyria greatly respected Nebo. They built a special temple for him and his partner, Tashmit, in the city of Kalkhi (now called Nimrud), which was once the capital of Assyria.</p><p>In the Bible, the prophet Isaiah wrote about Nebo. He mocked this god, saying that Nebo could not even save himself from being captured (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa46:1\">Isaiah 46:1</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3125\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Babylon, Babylonia</span>.</p>",
