    "content": "<h1>PELONITE</h1><p>A title given to two of David&apos;s mighty warriors: Helez and Ahijah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27,1Chr11:36\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:27, 36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:10\">27:10</a>). No one knows for sure where this place (&quot;Pelon&quot;) was located or what the name (&quot;Pelonite&quot;) means. Because of this uncertainty, some Bible scholars think &quot;Pelonite&quot; might be a mistake in the copying of ancient texts.</p><p>In another list of David&apos;s warriors found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:26\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:26</a>, Helez is called a &quot;Paltite&quot; (someone from Palt). Also, Ahijah is probably the same person as &quot;Eliam the Gilonite&quot; mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:34</a>. Many scholars believe these names (Paltite and Gilonite) are more accurate than &quot;Pelonite.&quot; </p><p>Others suggest that Pelonite comes from the town name “Beth-pelet” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:27\">Joshua 15:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:26\">Nehemiah 11:26</a>).</p>",
