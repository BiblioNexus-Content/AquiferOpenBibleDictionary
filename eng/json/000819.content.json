In the New Testament, it specifically refers to people who believe in Jesus as Lord and follow him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:14\">Acts 5:14</a>). </p><p>One would expect the term “believers” (sometimes translated as “faithful”) to be a title for Christians since the New Testament stresses belief in Jesus. Although New Testament authors emphasized believing, they rarely used the term “believer” as a name for Christians. </p><p>There are a few clear examples of &quot;believer&quot; being used as a name for Christians in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:32\">Acts 4:32</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:45\">10:45</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:18\">19:18</a>, and  <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:12\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:12</a>. But in other places, the term is a description, not a name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:44\">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:5\">15:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:27\">18:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:3</a>). As a name, “believer” points to the personal commitment of Christians to Jesus. Christians were called not merely to believe something but to give themselves to someone.</p>",
