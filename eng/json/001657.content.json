    "content": "<h1>DURA, Plain of</h1><p>The location in the province of Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar set up the great image of gold, which all his subjects were ordered to worship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:1\">Daniel 3:1</a>). This exact location is uncertain. It may be situated to the southeast of Babylon or located within the great outer wall of the city itself. The image was likely in a prominent place and an open area used for public gatherings. Since <em>dur</em> means &quot;rampart,&quot; the phrase should probably be translated as &quot;the plain of the rampart,&quot; implying that it would have been near the city wall somewhere.</p>",
