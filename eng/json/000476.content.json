    "content": "<h1>ARISTARCHUS</h1><p>A companion of the apostle Paul. Aristarchus was a Macedonian from Thessalonica, possibly of Jewish ancestry. He is first mentioned as one of those seized by an angry mob in Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:29\">Acts 19:29</a>). </p><p>Later, Aristarchus went with Paul on the return from his third missionary journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">Acts 20:4</a>). He also went to Rome with Paul to face Caesar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:1-Acts27:2\">Acts 27:1–2</a>). </p><p>Paul described Aristarchus as a coworker (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:24\">Philemon 1:24</a>) and fellow prisoner. Paul received great comfort from Aristarchus&apos; friendship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:10-Col4:11\">Colossians 4:10–11</a>). Tradition says that Roman Emperor Nero killed Aristarchus in Rome as a martyr.</p>",
