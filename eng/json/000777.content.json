    "content": "<h1>BEARD</h1><p>The hair growing on the lower part of a man’s face. </p><p>A beard was worn as a sign of maturity among people from the ancient Near East, including the Israelites. In Israel, care of the beard was religiously significant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:27\">Leviticus 19:27</a>). The laws in Leviticus commanded priests to not shave their heads or clip their beards (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6\">Leviticus 21:5</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6\">6</a>). David sent messengers to an Ammonite king, who were humiliated by having one side of their beards shaved off by the Ammonites. That insult, and others, led to war (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8\">8</a>). </p><p>It was sometimes appropriate to shave one’s beard. If someone may have had leprosy on the head or face, they had to shave around the spot to verify (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37\">Leviticus 13:29</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37\">37</a>). A shaven head, wailing, and wearing sackcloth were ways to signal future doom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3\">Isaiah 15:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3\">3</a>). Ezra acted out Israel’s spiritual disaster by pulling hair out of his head and beard (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:3\">Ezra 9:3</a>).</p>",
