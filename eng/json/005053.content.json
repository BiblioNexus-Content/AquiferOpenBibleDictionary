This region was evidently situated near the place of descent from the hill country to the lowlands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh7:5\">Jos 7:5</a>, see nlt mg). Shebarim means “breaches” or “ruins” and might possibly refer to the rough, rocky conditions that would characterize the region at the top of a steep mountain slope. Its location is unknown.</p>",
