    "content": "<h1>KNEELING</h1><p>A body position that means to worship, respect, or submit to someone. </p><p>Strong knees represented a person&apos;s strong faith, so kneeling showed respect for someone with greater authority. People knelt before kings, rulers, governors, or God. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen41:43\">Genesis 41:43</a>, people knelt before Pharaoh and Joseph. People showed their respect for God by kneeling (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa45:23\">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:11\">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:10\">Philippians 2:10</a>). During a famine when there was not enough food, some Israelites turned away from God. Those who stayed faithful were called “<span>all whose knees have not bowed to Baal</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:18\">1&nbsp;Kings 19:18</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:4\">Romans 11:4</a>).</p><p>Firm knees meant strength, so hurting those knees meant destroying power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:35\">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>). Isaiah asked God to make weak knees strong (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa35:3\">Isaiah 35:3</a>). Weak knees usually showed a lack of strong faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:4\">Job 4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:12\">Hebrews 12:12</a>). Sometimes it meant poor health (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps109:24\">Psalm 109:24</a>). Ezekiel talked about people whose knees “<span>will turn to water</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek7:17\">Ezekiel 7:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek21:7\">21:7</a>).</p><p>Kneeling before God was a way to show worship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps95:6\">Psalms 95:6</a>) and also prayer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan6:10\">Daniel 6:10</a>). Jesus himself knelt to pray in the garden of Gethsemane (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:41\">Luke 22:41</a>). Peter, Paul, and Stephen all did the same (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:60\">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:40\">9:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:36\">20:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:5\">21:5</a>). Solomon knelt in prayer to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:54\">1&nbsp;Kings 8:54</a>). Once he even had a platform built so everyone could see him kneeling before God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:13\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 6:13</a>).</p><p>Some knelt to show they were sorry like Ezra did at the evening sacrifice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:5\">Ezra 9:5</a>). Peter knelt to beg the Lord’s forgiveness for his lack of faith and trust (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:8\">Luke 5:8</a>). People asking the prophet Elijah for help knelt before him as God’s representative (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:13\">2&nbsp;Kings 1:13</a>). Many came kneeling and begging Jesus for healing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:14\">Matthew 17:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:40\">Mark 1:40</a>). Daniel knelt in wonder before an angel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan10:10\">Daniel 10:10</a>). When Belshazzar was afraid, his “knees knocked together” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan5:6\">Daniel 5:6</a>). </p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus was mocked by soldiers. They joked and pretended he was king.  They kneeled before him and cried, “Hail, King of the Jews” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:29\">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:19\">Mark 15:19</a>).</p>",
