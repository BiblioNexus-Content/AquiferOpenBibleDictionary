Adriel was the husband of Merab, who was King Saul&apos;s oldest daughter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 18:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:8\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:8</a>). He probably came from Abel-meholah, an important city in the region of Gilead. The marriage between Adriel and Merab was likely a political arrangement made by Saul and accepted by David. This arrangement happened even though David was originally supposed to marry Merab himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:17-1Sam18:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 18:17â€“19</a>).</p>",
