This land was near Geshur and close to the border of the land given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:14\">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:5\">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:11\">13:11</a>). Jair took control of this land, but he and his people could not remove the Maacathites and Geshurites who still lived there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:13\">Joshua 13:13</a>).</p><p>One Maacathite named Eliphelet joined David’s army. He was one of David’s &quot;mighty men&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:34</a>). In another list, he is called a Mekerathite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:36\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:36</a>). This may be a different name for the same place or person.</p><p>The Maacathites were not friendly toward Israel. Many years later, after Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, a man named Jaazaniah (whose father was a Maacathite) joined Ishmael the Ammonite to fight against Gedaliah. Gedaliah had been chosen by King Nebuchadnezzar to govern the city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23\">2&nbsp;Kings 25:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer40:8\">Jeremiah 40:8</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5977\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Maacah, Maachah (Place)</span>.</p>",
