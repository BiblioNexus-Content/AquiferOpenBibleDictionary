It may be a form created by dittography from an original Dimon, as in the oracle against Moab by Isaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:9\">Is 15:9</a>). If so, Khirbet Dimneh, seven and a half miles (12.1&nbsp;kilometers) northwest of Kerak at the head of Wadi Beni Hammad, would be a possible site. In any case, there is a word play in the Jeremiah passage between the place-name and the Hebrew word “be silent.”</p>",
