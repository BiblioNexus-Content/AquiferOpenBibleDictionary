It was probably just north of the Arnon River on the border of Moab and Amurru (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:16\">Numbers 21:16</a>). The name means “a well.” Water from the well they dug there was sung about (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:17-Num21:18\">Numbers 21:17–18</a>). It may have been in the same place as the Moabite well called <em>Beer-elim </em>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:8\">Isaiah 15:8</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p></li><li><p>The place that Gideon’s son Jotham escaped to after criticizing his half brother Abimelech, who had killed all his half-brothers while trying to become king of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:21\">Judges 9:21</a>).</p></li></ol>",
