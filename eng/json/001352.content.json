The apostle Paul&apos;s ship passed by this harbor while he was traveling to Italy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:7\">Acts 27:7</a>). During the second century BC, Jewish people had established a community there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:23\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:23</a>). Cnidus was originally built on an island, but today that island is connected to the mainland by a sandbar (a narrow strip of sand).</p>",
