    "content": "<h1>PINE TREE</h1><p>A pine tree is an evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves in clusters and seed-bearing cones. While there is some confusion about which exact conifer trees the Bible mentions, pines are likely referred to in several passages such as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:40\">Leviticus 23:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:15\">Nehemiah 8:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa41:19\">Isaiah 41:19</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:13\">60:13</a>.</p><p>One of the pine trees found in Israel and the surrounding areas is the Brutian pine <em>(Pinus brutia)</em>. This tree grows in the mountain regions of northern Palestine. It can grow from 3 to 10.7 meters (10 to 35 feet) tall with spread-out growth and branches that circle around the trunk in rings.</p><p>Another type is the Aleppo pine <em>(Pinus halepensis)</em>. In the Berean Standard Bible, the Hebrew words sometimes translated as &quot;fir&quot; in older versions are more accurately translated as &quot;cypress&quot; or &quot;pine.&quot; These trees may refer to the Aleppo pine or a similar species, such as the cypress (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:8,1Kgs5:10\">1&nbsp;Kings 5:8, 10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:34\">6:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:23\">2&nbsp;Kings 19:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:17\">Psalms 104:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:17\">Song of Songs 1:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:8\">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa37:24\">37:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:13\">55:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:13\">60:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:5\">Ezekiel 27:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek31:8\">31:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos14:8\">Hosea 14:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah2:3\">Nahum 2:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech11:2\">Zechariah 11:2</a>). The Aleppo pine grows from 2.7 to 18.3 meters tall (9 to 60 feet) with upward-spreading branches and yellowish or brownish smaller branches.</p>",
