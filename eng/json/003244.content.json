Jupiter was the son Saturn and husband and brother of Juno. </p><p>Jupiter (also called &quot;Jove&quot;) was the god of destiny. His weapon was the thunderbolt. The people considered the eagle, oak tree, and olive tree holy in his worship. A temple of Jupiter stood in Rome on the Capitoline Hill. During the time when Hadrian ruled (from AD 117–138), the people built a temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on top of the ruins of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.</p><p>During their first missionary journey, the apostles Barnabas and Paul went to Lystra. The people of Lystra thought they were gods who had come down to visit them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:12-Acts14:13\">Acts 14:12–13</a>). They thought Barnabas was Zeus (or Jupiter) and Paul was Hermes (or Mercury).</p>",
