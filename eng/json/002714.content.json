Many scholars believe that the lily mentioned in several verses in Song of Songs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:1-Song2:2,Song2:16\">2:1–2, 16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:5\">4:5</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:2-Song6:4\">6:2–4</a>) may actually be the garden hyacinth.</p><p>This plant grows naturally in fields and rocky areas throughout Israel and the surrounding areas, Lebanon, and regions to the north. In its wild form, the hyacinth always has deep blue flowers that give off a very pleasant smell.</p><p><em>See also </em><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5922\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Lily</span>.</p>",
