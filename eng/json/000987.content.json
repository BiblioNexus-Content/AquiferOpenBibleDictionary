Abner was the commander of the army of Ishbosheth. He fled through Bithron after losing a battle to the army of David. The Hebrew root word means “to cut into pieces.” There are three explanations: </p><ol><li><p>It refers to a valley (possibly the Jabbok). </p></li><li><p>It is the area “cut off” by a great curve in the Jabbok River.</p></li><li><p>It refers to the first part of the day, “all morning” (Berean Standard Bible).</p></li></ol>",
