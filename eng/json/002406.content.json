    "content": "<h1>HARAR, HARARITE</h1><p>The terms &quot;Harar&quot; and &quot;Hararite&quot; are used to describe several of King David&apos;s &quot;mighty men&quot; in the Bible. A Hararite was someone who came from a place called Harar. </p><p>Shammah was one of the mightiest men of David. He was father of Jonathan. This is a different Jonathan than the son of King Saul who was a friend of David. Shammah was a Hararite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11,2Sam23:33\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:11, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:34\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:34</a> has “Shagee”). Agee, the father of Shammah was also a Hararite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:11</a>). Sharar, the father of Ahiam, is also called a Hararite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:33\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:33</a>; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:35\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:35</a> he is called “Sachar”). </p><p>We are not completely sure what these terms mean. They might refer to a mountain village called Harar, or they might mean &quot;mountaineer&quot; (someone who lives in the mountains).</p>",
