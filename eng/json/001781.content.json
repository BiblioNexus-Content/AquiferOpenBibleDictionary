    "content": "<h1>ELKANAH</h1><ol><li><p>A Levite who belonged to the family of Korah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:24\">Exodus 6:24</a>). He was a descendant of Izhar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:21\">Exodus 6:21</a>). Elkanah was the son of Assir, and he became the father of Ebiasaph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:23\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:23</a>).</p></li><li><p>The father of the prophet Samuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:19</a>). He was the son of Jeroham of Ephraim, from Ramathaim-zophim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1\">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Hannah could not have children at first (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:2\">1 Samuel 1:2</a>). Hannah prayed to God many times, asking for a son whom she promised to give to serve God. After this, Samuel was born. After he was weaned, Hannah brought him to the elderly priest Eli for training. Elkanah had other sons and daughters by Hannah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:21\">1 Samuel 2:21</a>). Elkanah became the ancestor of Heman, who was a singer in David’s time.</p></li><li><p>A Kohathite Levite who descended from Korah&apos;s family line. He was one of the ancestors of Heman the singer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:26,1Chr6:35\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:26, 35</a>).</p></li><li><p>Another Kohathite Levite who also descended from Korah&apos;s line and was among the ancestors of Heman the singer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:26,1Chr6:35\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:26, 35</a>).</p></li><li><p>A Levite who lived in the village of the Netophathites and later lived in Jerusalem in the time after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:16</a>).</p></li><li><p>A Benjamite warrior who joined David’s mighty men at Ziklag (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:6</a>).</p></li><li><p>A gatekeeper (guard) for the ark of the covenant during David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:23\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:23</a>). He is perhaps the same as #6 above.</p></li><li><p>One who was important in King Ahaz’s court. Elkanah was killed by Zichri, an Ephraimite, because Elkanah had turned away from the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:7\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:7</a>).</p></li></ol>",
