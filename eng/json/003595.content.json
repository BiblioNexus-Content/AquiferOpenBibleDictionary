    "content": "<h1>MAGI</h1><p>The wise men mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:12\">Matthew 2:1–12 </a>who followed a star to Jerusalem and then to Bethlehem to honor the newborn &quot;king of the Jews.&quot; This part of Matthew&apos;s Gospel is important because it highlights Jesus&apos; true identity as a King and hints at how people from outside Israel (Gentiles) would come to honor Him throughout the Gospel.</p><h2>The Magi in the Ancient World</h2><p>Historical records from outside the Bible provide clues about where the magi in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:23\">Matthew 2</a> might have come from and what roles they played. The ancient historian Herodotus described magi as a group of priests from Media or Persia. At that time, Persia&apos;s main religion was Zoroastrianism, so Herodotus likely referred to Zoroastrian priests. According to Herodotus, along with other historians like Plutarch and Strabo, these magi were involved in religious ceremonies (such as overseeing sacrifices and prayers) and served as advisers to eastern rulers.</p><p>These rulers believed that the movements of the stars and other celestial events reflected what would happen in history. Therefore, they often relied on the magi&apos;s knowledge of star charts and dream interpretation to make decisions. The magi&apos;s interest in the movement of the stars might explain why they noticed the star in Matthew&apos;s account and why they, along with King Herod, believed it signified the birth of an important new ruler (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:2\">Matthew 2:2</a>). Centuries before Christ, people also connected a star with the birth of Alexander the Great.</p><h2>Identity in Matthew’s Gospel</h2><p>Matthew’s account does not give much information about who the magi were. He only mentions that they came &quot;from the east&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:2\">Matthew 2:1–2</a>), which means we do not know where they came from. Some early Christian leaders thought the magi might have come from Arabia because the gifts they brought—gold, frankincense, and myrrh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:11\">Matthew 2:11</a>)—were likely from that region. Others believed the magi were from Chaldea or Media/Persia, where there was a class of priests called magi that fit Matthew&apos;s description.</p><h2>Significance in Matthew’s Gospel</h2><p>The visit of the magi is important for introducing Matthew’s Gospel: </p><ol><li><p>It reveals the true identity of the infant Jesus as the long-awaited royal Messiah of Israel. This is shown by the appearance of the &quot;star,&quot; which had clear messianic meanings: &quot;<span>A star will come forth from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num24:17\">Numbers 24:17</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:3\">Isaiah 60:3</a>). </p></li><li><p>The interaction between the magi, Herod, and the chief priests and scribes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:2-Matt2:6\">Matthew 2:2–6</a>) shows that Jesus fulfills the prophecy of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic5:2\">Micah 5:2</a>, which foretold that Israel&apos;s ruler would come from Bethlehem. </p></li><li><p>The gifts the magi offered (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:11\">Matthew 2:11</a>) might reflect promises in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps68:29\">Psalms 68:29</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps72:10\">72:10</a>, which were also seen as hints about the Messiah.</p></li></ol><p>Besides confirming that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah, the magi&apos;s visit introduces several important themes that continue in Matthew’s Gospel. </p><ol><li><p>Jesus’ role as Messiah affects not only the Jews but also the Gentiles (represented by the &quot;wise men from the East&quot;).</p></li><li><p>The surprising faith of Gentiles, a faith that is sometimes lacking among Jesus’ own people. While the foreign magi honor the infant Messiah, King Herod and possibly the Jewish religious leaders plot to kill Him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:3-Matt2:6\">Matthew 2:3–6, 16</a>). This theme appears again in the Gospel, where Gentiles often show faith in Jesus, contrasting with the lack of faith among many Jews (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13\">Matthew 8:5–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:21-Matt15:28\">15:21–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:19\">27:19, 54</a>).</p></li></ol>",
