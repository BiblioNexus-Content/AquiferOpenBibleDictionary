    "content": "<h1>REPHAIM</h1><ol><li><p>In several Old Testament passages, <em>Rephaim</em> refers to the spirits of dead people who live in the place of the dead, called <em>Sheol</em> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov2:18\">Proverbs 2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov9:18\">9:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov21:16\">21:16</a>). The rephaim of the underworld suffered (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:5\">Job 26:5</a>). They were separated from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps88:10-Ps88:12\">Psalm 88:10–12</a>). They were also seprated from all living people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:14\">Isaiah 26:14</a>). They are weak and shadow-like, not strong like living people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:9\">Isaiah 14:9</a>).</p></li><li><p>The word <em>Rephaim</em> also describes a group of very tall and strong people who lived in the land of Canaan during Abraham’s time. Along with other ancient groups like the Zuzim, Emim, and Horites, they were defeated by Kedorlaomer and his allies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:5\">Genesis 14:5</a>). They were one of nine nations living in Palestine at the time when the Lord promised to give the land to the descendants of Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:20\">15:20</a>). </p><p>Other nations had different names for them. The Moabites called them the Emim, and the Ammonites called them the Zamzummim. These groups were as large and tall as the Anakim, another group of giants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:11,Deut2:20\">Deuteronomy 2:11, 20</a>). </p><p>Og, king of Bashan, was the last known Rephaim king. The Israelites defeated him under Moses’s leadership and took his land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:11\">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:4\">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:12\">13:12</a>). Some of the giants who fought with the Philistines may have come from the Rephaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr20:1-1Chr20:8\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 20</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4612\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Giants</span>.</p></li></ol>",
