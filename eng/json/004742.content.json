Stephen quoted from the text of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos5:26\">Amos 5:26</a> to show how the Israelites worshiped false gods during their time in the wilderness. </p><p>Stephen was quoting from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). The Septuagint translators understood the Hebrew word <em>kaiwan</em> to refer to the Assyrian god of Saturn, or possibly to the Egyptian Saturn god Repa.</p><p>Some scholars argue that <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos5:26\">Amos 5:26</a> does not name specific ancient gods at all, but is simply making a general reference to the false worship practiced by the Israelites in the wilderness.</p>",
