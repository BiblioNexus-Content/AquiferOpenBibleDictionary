    "content": "<h1>BLINDNESS</h1><p>The condition of being unable to see. Blindness was common in the ancient Near East. It is still common among many poor and tribal communities that do not have access to modern medicine.</p><h2>What Causes Blindness?</h2><p>The Bible does not discuss the medical cause of blindness, but poor personal hygiene and unsanitary (unclean or dirty) living conditions likely contributed. Newborn babies were the most at risk. Most blindness from birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:3\">John 9:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:3\">3</a>) was likely caused by germs passed by the mother to the baby&apos;s eyes, such as gonorrhea. Inflammation, pus, and swelling would develop within three days. The basic medical treatment could not prevent eye damage. </p><p>Modern medicine can treat babies with eyedrops, but these are not always available to those who are poor. It is also rejected in parts of the Middle East today. Babies and young children also faced threats by other diseases of the eyes that were spread by pests. These diseases would cause heavy crusting, droopy eyelids, loss of eyelashes, and eventually total blindness. In parts of the world, folk superstition still allows flies to fly around on babies. </p><p>Blindness among adults might be caused by:</p><ul><li><p>Malaria</p></li><li><p>Long exposure to sandstorms</p></li><li><p>Sun glare in the desert</p></li><li><p>Accidents</p></li><li><p>Punishment (as with Samson, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg16:21\">Judges 16:21</a>)</p></li><li><p>Old age (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:1\">Genesis 27:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:15\">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:4\">1&nbsp;Kings 14:4</a>)</p></li></ul><h2>Blindness in the Old Testament</h2><p>The Old Testament required special care for the blind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:14\">Leviticus 19:14</a>). Those who misled people who were blind were punished (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut27:18\">Deuteronomy 27:18</a>). Blind men were not allowed to be priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:18\">Leviticus 21:18</a>).</p><h2>Blindness in the New Testament</h2><p>Jesus’s healing ministry fulfilled prophecy by bringing sight to the blind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:18\">Luke 4:18</a>). His ability to restore sight proved to John the Baptist that Jesus was the Messiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:5\">Matthew 11:5</a>). Jesus healed:</p><ul><li><p>Two blind men in Galilee (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:27-Matt9:30\">Matthew 9:27</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:27-Matt9:30\">30</a>)</p></li><li><p>One blind man in Bethsaida (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:22-Mark8:26\">Mark 8:22</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:22-Mark8:26\">26</a>)</p></li><li><p>A man blind from birth in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:41\">John 9</a>)</p></li><li><p>A blind beggar named Bartimaeus and his friend at Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:46-Mark10:52\">Mark 10:46</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:46-Mark10:52\">52</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:30-Matt20:34\">Matthew 20:30</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:30-Matt20:34\">34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:35-Luke18:43\">Luke 18:35</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:35-Luke18:43\">43</a>)</p></li></ul><p>At times, Jesus immediately healed the blind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:52\">Mark 10:52</a>). Other times, he healed them through acts, like using clay and water (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:6-John9:11\">John 9:6</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:6-John9:11\">11</a>) or spit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:23\">Mark 8:23</a>). </p><p>The apostle Paul was blinded when he converted and was healed in the presence of Ananias (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:9,Acts9:18\">Acts 9:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:9,Acts9:18\">9, 18</a>). Later, Paul blinded a sorcerer, Elymas, with temporary blindness for opposing his ministry in Cyprus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:11\">Acts 13:11</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>.</p>",
