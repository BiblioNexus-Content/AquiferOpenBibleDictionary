    "content": "<h1>HOUSEHOLD</h1><p>A household is a group of people who live together as a family. In biblical times, a household was much larger than what we might think of as a family today. It included a father, mother or mothers, children, grandparents, servants, concubines (women who lived with a man but had fewer rights than wives), and sojourners (people staying temporarily with the family). </p><p>For example, the household of the patriarch Jacob included 66 people. This was not counting the wives of his sons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:26\">Genesis 46:26</a>). The household was treated as one unit, and all members shared responsibility for protecting the family&apos;s honor. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:27</a>, we see an example of a household seeking revenge to defend their family&apos;s honor.</p><p>In the Old Testament, all the males in Abrahamâ€™s household were circumcised as a sign of the covenant God made with him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:23\">Genesis 17:23</a>). In the New Testament era, there are instances where entire households were baptized (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:14\">Acts 11:14</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4403\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Family Life and Relations</span>.</p>",
