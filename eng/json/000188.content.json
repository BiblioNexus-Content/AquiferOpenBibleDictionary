Ahimaaz was loyal to King David during Absalom’s rebellion. He and Jonathan, the son of the priest Abiathar, shared information with King David. News of Absalom’s movements was sent from Zadok and Abiathar in Jerusalem to Ahimaaz and Jonathan in En-rogel and then brought to David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:27-2Sam15:29\">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:27</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:27-2Sam15:29\">29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:15-2Sam17:23\">17:15</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:15-2Sam17:23\">23</a>). Ahimaaz was probably well-known as a fast runner. He outran the official messenger, sending news to David of Absalom’s defeat (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:19-2Sam18:33\">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:19–33</a>).</p></li><li><p>One of 12 officers in charge of getting food for Solomon’s house.
