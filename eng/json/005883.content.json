    "content": "<h1>ZAIR</h1><p>Place where Joram attacked and defeated the Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:21\">2&nbsp;Kgs 8:21</a>). In the parallel passage of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:9\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 21:9</a>, the phrase “to Zair” is replaced by the phrase “with his commanders” (the Hebrew words are similar). Many have therefore suggested that a copyist revision appeared in 2&nbsp;Chronicles because the location of Zair was unknown. Others have suggested that Zair should be identified with Zoar on the southeast end of the Dead Sea, or with Seir in Edom. In any case, it was located in Transjordan on a principal road to Edom.</p>",
