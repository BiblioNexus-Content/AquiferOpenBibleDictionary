Ithamar served as a priest to the tribes of Israel when the people lived in the desert wilderness between Egypt and the promised land of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:23\">Exodus 6:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num3:2-Num3:4\">Numbers 3:2–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:60\">26:60</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:2\">24:2</a>). After the death of two of his brothers, he was given the special duty of being in charge of moving of the tabernacle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num4:28,Num4:33\">Numbers 4:28, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:8\">7:8</a>). During David’s reign, the descendants of Ithamar and Eleazar were organized as priests in the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3-1Chr24:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:3–6</a>). Later, some of his descendants returned with Ezra from Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:2\">Ezra 8:2</a>).</p>",
