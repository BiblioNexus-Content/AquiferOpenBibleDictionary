    "content": "<h1>ELIZABETH</h1><p>The mother of John the Baptist and a relative of Mary, the mother of Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:36\">Luke 1:36</a>). She came from a family of priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:5\">Luke 1:5</a>). The name Elizabeth comes from the same Hebrew word as Elisheba, the wife of Aaron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:23\">Exodus 6:23</a>). It means &quot;my God is an oath.&quot; Only the Gospel of Luke, which often emphasizes the role of women, tells us about Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah.</p><p>Luke emphasizes that Elizabeth and Zechariah were righteous and lived in a way that pleased God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:6\">Luke 1:6</a>). However, the couple was elderly and had no children, which was often seen as a disgrace in Jewish culture (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:23\">Genesis 30:22–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:25\">Luke 1:25</a>). Despite this, they remained faithful in their worship and service to God. One day, an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, announcing that Elizabeth would have a son. This son would be the one to prepare the way for the promised Messiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:13-Luke1:17\">Luke 1:13–17</a>). When Elizabeth became pregnant, she stayed in seclusion for five months. During this time, her relative Mary came to visit her.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5583\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">John the Baptist</span>.</p>",
