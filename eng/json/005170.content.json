    "content": "<h1>SHITTIM (Place)</h1><p>A site on the Moab plains. The Israelites camped there after defeating Sihon and Og (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:35\">Numbers 21:21–35</a>) and before crossing the Jordan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1\">Numbers 25:1</a>). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:49\">Numbers 33:49</a>, this camp was near the Jordan River. The campsite spread from Beth-jeshimoth to Abel-shittim. Abel-shittim seems to be the full name of the place, while Shittim is the more common, shorter name.</p><p>At Shittim, Balak, who ruled Moab, wanted to prevent the Israelites from entering Canaan. He paid Balaam to speak curses against them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25\">Numbers 22–24</a>). Later, following Balaam&apos;s advice, the Israelite men had sexual relations with women from Midian and Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:5\">Numbers 25:1–5</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num31:15-Num31:16\">31:15–16</a>). The Israelites turned away from God to worship false gods through these sexual acts. This made God angry, and he sent a deadly disease among the people at Peor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18\">Numbers 25:1–18</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:6-1Cor10:8\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:6–8</a>).  </p><p>At Shittim, Moses and Eleazar counted all the people in each tribe. Here also, Joshua was chosen in front of everyone to be the next leader after Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:22\">Numbers 27:18–22</a>). Joshua then sent two men from Shittim to secretly look at the city of Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh2:1\">Joshua 2:1</a>). After this, the Israelites left Shittim and went to the Jordan River, getting ready to cross it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:1\">Joshua 3:1</a>).</p><p>The name Shittim appears in only two other places in the Bible outside of the first six books: the books of Joel and Micah. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel3:18\">Joel 3:18</a>, the prophet talks about the &quot;valley of Shittim,&quot; which is also called the &quot;Valley of Acacias.&quot; This is not talking about a real place. Instead, it is a picture of how God will make dry, empty land good for growing plants when he brings his people back in the final days.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic6:5\">Micah 6:5</a>, God tells the people to remember their journey from Shittim to Gilgal. This refers to when the Israelites crossed the Jordan River, and God&apos;s covenant promise to give them their own land. Micah then talks about the many ways God had helped his people.</p>",
