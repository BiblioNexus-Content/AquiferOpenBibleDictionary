    "content": "<h1>BARACHIAH, BARACHIAS</h1><p>The name given to Zechariah’s father in the New Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:35\">Matthew 23:35</a>). Zechariah was executed in the temple by order of King Joash, but was said to be the son of Jehoiada (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 24:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22\">22</a>). “Son of Barachiah” might be a copyist’s addition, since in a similar passage in Luke’s Gospel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:51\">Luke 11:51</a>) the name does not appear in the most reliable manuscripts. A copyist may have confused the martyred Zechariah with the prophet Zechariah, whose father was Berechiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech1:1,Zech1:7\">Zechariah 1:1, 7</a>).</p>",
