    "content": "<h1>CLOPAS</h1><p>The husband of Mary, one of the women who was there when Jesus was crucified (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:25\">John 19:25</a>). In the Greek text, it is not clear if Mary, Clopas&apos;s wife, was also Jesus&apos;s mother&apos;s sister or if she was a different person. There are three different ideas about who Clopas might have been:</p><ol><li><p>Some say Clopas was Joseph&apos;s brother.</p></li><li><p>Some connect him to Cleopas, who appears in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:18\">Luke 24:18.</a> EHowever, the name &quot;Clopas&quot; comes from Hebrew, while &quot;Cleopas&quot; comes from Greek.</p></li><li><p>Some think he might be the same person as Alphaeus. This would only be possible if James, the son of Alphaeus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:3\">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:15\">Luke 6:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:13\">Acts 1:13</a>) is the same as James, the son of Mary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:56\">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:40\">Mark 15:40</a>). Mary also has to be the same person mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:25\">John 19:25</a>. </p></li></ol><p>These are all possible ideas, but we cannot be certain. Clopas, Cleopas, and Alphaeus might all be different people.</p>",
