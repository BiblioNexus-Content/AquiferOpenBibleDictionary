The name is Egyptian and is given as a boundary of the land to be possessed by the Hebrews (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:3\">Jos 13:3</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr13:5\">First Chronicles 13:5</a> refers to Shihor as the southwestern limit of Israelite settlement in the time of David. Isaiah speaks of grain from the region of Shihor as a source of income for the city of Sidon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa23:3\">Is 23:3</a>). Jeremiah describes Shihor as “the waters of the Nile” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer2:18\">Jer 2:18</a>). Some believe that the Shihor was the easternmost branch of the Nile Delta. Others identify the Shihor with the Wadi el-Arish, 90 miles (144.8 kilometers) east of the Suez Canal. Still others identify it with the Brook (or River) of Egypt, a body of water whose precise location cannot be determined with certainty.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3515\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Brook of Egypt</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6572\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Nile River</span>.</p>",
