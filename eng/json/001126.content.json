    "content": "<h1>CAIAPHAS</h1><p>Caiaphas was the high priest during Jesus&apos; life and ministry. As the leader of the Jewish nation, he headed the Sanhedrin, the highest court. Next to the Roman governor, Caiaphas was the most powerful man in Judea, responsible to the Romans for the nation&apos;s behavior. He was particularly worried about the excitement and unrest surrounding Jesus, especially with the growing activities of the Zealots, who would soon start a rebellion.</p><p>The raising of Lazarus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:1-John11:57\">John 11</a>) caused a big stir, pushing tensions to a peak. Caiaphas, fearing that those seeking a political messiah might trigger a Roman crackdown, suggested that Jesus be put to death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:48-John11:50\">John 11:48</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:48-John11:50\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:48-John11:50\">50</a>). The Gospel of John notes that, in doing so, Caiaphas unknowingly prophesied about the atoning nature of Jesus&apos; death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:51-John11:52\">John 11:51</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:51-John11:52\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:51-John11:52\">52</a>).</p><p>Caiaphas played a central role in Jesus&apos; arrest and trial. The religious leaders made their plans in his palace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:3-Matt26:5\">Matthew 26:3</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:3-Matt26:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:3-Matt26:5\">5</a>), and part of Jesus&apos; trial took place there with Caiaphas presiding (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:57-Matt26:68\">Matthew 26:57</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:57-Matt26:68\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:57-Matt26:68\">68</a>). Before this, Jesus was first brought to Annas, Caiaphas&apos;s father-in-law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:13\">John 18:13</a>). Although Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not mention the visit to Annas, and Mark and Luke do not refer to Caiaphas by name, John&apos;s account shows Annas was still influential.</p><p>When Jesus admitted he was &quot;the Christ, the Son of God,&quot; Caiaphas tore his robes and accused him of blasphemy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:63-Matt26:66\">Matthew 26:63</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:63-Matt26:66\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:63-Matt26:66\">66</a>). After Pentecost, Caiaphas, along with other Jewish leaders, led the trial of Peter and John, trying to stop the apostles&apos; preaching (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:5-Acts4:6\">Acts 4:5</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:5-Acts4:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:5-Acts4:6\">6</a>).</p><p>Annas, a former high priest, remained important in Jewish affairs, which explains why Luke mentions both Annas and Caiaphas in connection with John the Baptist&apos;s ministry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:2\">Luke 3:2</a>) and in Acts called Annas the high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:6\">Acts 4:6</a>). John&apos;s Gospel also shows Annas was still commonly called &quot;high priest&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:22\">John 18:22</a>).</p><p>According to the historian Josephus, Caiaphas was appointed high priest around AD 18 and served until he was removed around AD 36. Since the high priest served at the Romans&apos; discretion, Caiaphas&apos;s long tenure suggests he was politically skilled. After being removed by the Roman proconsul Vitellus, nothing more is known about him.</p>",
