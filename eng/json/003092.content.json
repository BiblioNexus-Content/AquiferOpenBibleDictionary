    "content": "<h1>JESSE (Person)</h1><p>Son of Obed and grandson of Ruth and Boaz (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:17,Ruth4:22\">Ru 4:17, 22</a>). Jesse was a shepherd from Bethlehem. He had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest. He had at least two daughters, Zeruiah and Abigail, who became mothers of famous warriors.</p><p>When Samuel went to Jesse’s home to search for and anoint a king, Jesse did not at first feel it worthwhile to call David for examination (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:11\">1&nbsp;Sm 16:11</a>). Later he sent David to play the lyre for Saul (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:19-1Sam16:21\">19–21</a>). After David became a fugitive from Saul, Jesse and others of the family came to David in the cave of Adullam. David then brought his father and mother to Mizpah in Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:3\">22:3</a>). Nothing further is heard of Jesse.</p><p>After Saul broke with David, he commonly spoke of David derisively as a “son of Jesse” to underscore his humble origins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam20:31\">1&nbsp;Sm 20:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:7\">22:7</a>). This same emphasis on Jesse’s modest station in life is found in such messianic references as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1\">Isaiah 11:1</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:1-Isa10:34\">10</a>, which speak of the “shoot from the stump of Jesse” and “the root of Jesse” (rsv).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3937\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">David</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5518\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jesse, Root of</span>.</p>",
