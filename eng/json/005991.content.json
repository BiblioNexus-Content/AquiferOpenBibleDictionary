One of the cities in the hill country belonging to Judah’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:55\">Jos 15:55</a>), mentioned with Maon, Carmel, Jezreel, and most prominently with Hebron (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:42\">1&nbsp;Chr 2:42</a>). Ziph has been identified with a site three miles (4.8 kilometers) south of Hebron. The surrounding wilderness region is probably the “wilderness of Ziph” where David hid from Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:14-1Sam23:15\">1&nbsp;Sm 23:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:2\">26:2</a>). The Ziphites who betrayed David to Saul were residents of this city and the surrounding region (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:19\">1&nbsp;Sm 23:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:1\">26:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps54:1\">Ps 54 title</a>). Ziph is later mentioned as one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:8\">2&nbsp;Chr 11:8</a>).</p>",
