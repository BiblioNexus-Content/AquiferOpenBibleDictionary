    "content": "<h1>MINNI</h1><p>People mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer51:27\">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, along with Ararat and Ashkenaz, as aggressors against Babylon. The Minni first appear in Assyrian inscriptions during the reign of Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC), who pillaged and subdued the people. They lived between Lake Urmia and Lake Van, north of Babylon, and are identified with the Mannean people, regularly associated with Urarteans (Ararat) in Assyrian manuscripts. The Minni were restless subjects. They revolted against Assyria in 716 and 715 BC. Further agitation occurred in the reign of Ashurbanipal (669–627 BC). After Nineveh’s fall to the Babylonians in 612 BC, the Minni disappear from the extrabiblical record.</p>",
