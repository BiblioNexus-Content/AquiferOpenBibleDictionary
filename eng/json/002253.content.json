    "content": "<h1>GOLIATH</h1><p>Goliath was a Philistine warrior from the city of Gath who lived in the eleventh century BC. He challenged the Israelite army to battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</a>). The young David later defeated him by knocking him down with a stone from his sling and then cutting off his head. </p><p>Goliath was over 2.7 meters (nine feet) tall. He wore armor that weighed about 56.8 kilograms (125 pounds). He carried a spear that weighed 6.8 kilograms (15 pounds). After Goliath&apos;s death, his sword was kept at Nob and was later given to David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:9\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:10\">22:10</a>). </p><p>Goliath might have been a descendant of the Anakim (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:22\">Joshua 11:22</a>). The Anakim were known for their unusual height. Another possibility is that Goliath&apos;s extreme height was caused by a medical condition (a growth in the pituitary gland in his brain).</p><p>There is a difference in biblical accounts about who killed Goliath. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:19</a> says that Elhanan killed Goliath. However, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5\">1 Chronicles 20:5 </a>says that Elhanan actually killed Goliath&apos;s brother.</p>",
