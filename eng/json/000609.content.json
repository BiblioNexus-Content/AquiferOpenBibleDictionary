The Berean Standard Bible and other English versions use &quot;Imperial Regiment&quot; instead of &quot;Augustus&apos;s Band.&quot;</p><p>A centurion (an officer in charge of about 100 soldiers) named Julius was a member of Augustus&apos;s Band. He was a commander who had custody of the apostle Paul on the way to Rome. The Greek word translated as “band” normally meant a Roman cohort (500 men) or force of two cohorts. </p><p>Some scholars assume that Julius was in command of that unit. It is unusual that an officer who normally commanded a century (100 men) would be in charge of 500 to 1,000 men. It is possible Julius was not in command of the whole unit. Or, it might not have been a regular cohort. It may have been a special group meant to send messages or act as guards.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8197\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Warfare</span>.</p>",
