    "content": "<h1>HARIM</h1><p>1. Priest whom King David appointed to official duties in the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:8\">1&nbsp;Chr 24:8</a>).</p><p>2. Ancestor of a Jewish family who returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:32\">Ezr 2:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:5\">Neh 10:5</a>). Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:31\">Ezr 10:31</a>), but they divorced their wives and a representative of the clan signed Ezra’s covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:27\">Neh 10:27</a>).</p><p>3. Ancestor of a family of priests who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:39\">Ezr 2:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:42\">Neh 7:42</a>). Some identify him with #1 above. Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women.</p><p>4. Ancestor of Malkijah. Malkijah repaired a section of the Jerusalem wall during Nehemiah’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:11\">Neh 3:11</a>). This Harim could be the same as #2 above.</p><p>5. Priest who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:3\">Neh 12:3</a>; Hebrew “Rehum,” see nlt mg). His son (or grandson) Adna is listed as a leading priest during the high priesthood of Joiakim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:15\">12:15</a>). Later, under Ezra, a representative of the family (probably related to #3 above) signed the covenant of faithfulness to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:5\">10:5</a>).</p>",
