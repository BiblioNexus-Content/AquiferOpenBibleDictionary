The city (not mentioned in the Bible) was culturally Greek, attracting many Greek immigrants; it was also a mercantile center of exchange. Dion was one of only two Decapolis cities having a Macedonian name (the other being Pella). It was located in Palestine east of the Jordan, possibly near the Yarmuk River and the town of Gadara. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3958\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Decapolis</span>.</p>",
