The Old Testament does not clearly state what this person did, but the recorder probably kept the official records and gave advice to the king based on this information. </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:16\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:16</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:24\">20:24</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:3\">1&nbsp;Kings 4:3 </a>mention a recorder with other leading officers. The recorder spoke for King Hezekiah in his dealings with Rabshekah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18\">2&nbsp;Kings 18:18</a>). During the rule of King Josiah, a recorder supervised temple repairs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr34:8\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:8</a>).</p>",
