    "content": "<h1>Oleander</h1><p>A poisonous evergreen shrub that grows in warm climates. One suggestion for the plants called &quot;roses&quot; in various Bible translations is the oleander (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Sir24:14\">Sirach 24:14</a>, King James Version). This plant originally came from the East Indies but has been grown throughout warm regions of the world for hundreds of years.</p><p>The oleander (<em>Nerium oleander</em>)<em> </em>grows well in Israel and the surrounding areas. It forms thick clusters in some parts of the Jordan Valley. It is usually a shrub that grows from 0.9 to 3.7 meters (3 to 12 feet) tall. Every part of the oleander plant is dangerously poisonous.</p>",
