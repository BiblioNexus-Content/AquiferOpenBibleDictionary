    "content": "<h1>PREPARATION, Day of</h1><p>The Day of Preparation is the name given in Scripture for the day before the Sabbath. Each of the Gospels refers to a day that it calls &quot;the Preparation&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:62\">Matthew 27:62</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:42\">Mark 15:42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:54\">Luke 23:54</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:14,John19:31,John19:42\">John 19:14, 31, 42</a>). Mark calls it &quot;the day before the Sabbath.&quot; The Jews did not have specific names for the days of the week. Instead, they referred to &quot;the first [second, etc.] day of the week.&quot; But the Sabbath was distinctive, and the previous day was used to prepare for this weekly day of rest and&nbsp;worship. Thus, what we call &quot;Friday&quot; the Jews called &quot;Preparation.&quot; What was &quot;prepared&quot; is not said. But as no work could be done on the Sabbath, preparations had to be made for food and other necessities.</p><p>&quot;The Preparation of the Passover&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:14\">John 19:14</a>) is often understood to mean &quot;Passover eve,&quot; the day before Passover. This understanding comes from the common use of &quot;the Preparation&quot; for the day before the Sabbath. Outside historical examples of people calling the day before the Passover &quot;the Preparation&quot; do not exist.</p>",
