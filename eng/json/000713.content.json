    "content": "<h1>BALDNESS</h1><p>The condition of having little or no hair on the scalp. </p><p>The Bible indirectly refers to natural baldness due to age, contrasting it with baldness caused by leprosy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:40-Lev13:42\">Leviticus 13:40</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:40-Lev13:42\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:40-Lev13:42\">42</a>). The Israelites were forbidden from shaving their heads or shaping their beards in ways that mimicked pagan religious practices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut14:1\">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>), with such restrictions particularly applying to Israelite priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:5\">Leviticus 21:5</a>). However, shaving off hair and offering it as a sacrifice to God was a prescribed act for those taking a Nazirite vow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:5,Num6:18\">Numbers 6:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:5,Num6:18\">5, 18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:18\">Acts 18:18</a>).</p><p>In ancient cultures like Egypt, shaving hair and eyebrows was a sign of respect for the dead. The Bible references this custom among non-Israelites as a sign of mourning or anguish (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer16:6\">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:37\">48:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:31\">Ezekiel 27:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic1:16\">Micah 1:16</a>). This is often in the context of God&apos;s judgment against pagan cities or nations. Because baldness was associated with leprosy, venereal disease, idolatry, or death, prophetic warnings sometimes included predictions or threats of baldness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:24\">Isaiah 3:16</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:24\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:24\">24</a>).</p>",
