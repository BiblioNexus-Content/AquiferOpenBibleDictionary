    "content": "<h1>TROGYLLIUM</h1><p>Trogyllium is a rocky area in the sea between the island of Samos and the city of Miletus. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:15\">Acts 20:15</a>, some early copies of the Bible mention that Paul&apos;s ship stopped at this place during his journey to Jerusalem near the end of his third missionary journey. Since Trogyllium is a piece of land that sticks out into the sea between Samos and Miletus, it would be reasonable for a sailing ship to have stopped there for the night. </p><p>However, most scholars who study ancient Bible manuscripts believe the phrase &quot;after remaining at Trogyllium&quot; (which appears in the King James Version) was added to the Bible text later and was not part of the original writing.</p>",
