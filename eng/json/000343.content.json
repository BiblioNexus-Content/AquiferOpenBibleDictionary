Then Antiochus gave the order for Andronicus to be put to death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc4:31-2Macc4:38\">2&nbsp;Maccabees 4:31–38</a>).</p></li><li><p>The officer in charge of Gerizim after Antiochus Epiphanes destroyed Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc5:21-2Macc5:23\">2&nbsp;Maccabees 5:21–23</a>).</p></li><li><p>A Christian greeted by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:7\">16:7</a>). He is not mentioned elsewhere. Paul called Andronicus his kinsman. The word could mean fellow countryman, fellow Jew, member of Paul’s own family, or other relative. Andronicus may also have been a fellow prisoner for the cause of Christ. He could have perhaps even been in the same prison with Paul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4-2Cor6:5\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:4–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23\">11:23</a>). Paul described him as important among the apostles and recognized him respectfully as an “older” Christian.</p></li></ol>",
