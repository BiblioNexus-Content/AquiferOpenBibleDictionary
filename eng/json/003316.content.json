It was situated between Mt Sinai and Hazeroth, but its exact site is unknown. The name, meaning “graves of craving,” accords with the account of the quails.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p>",
