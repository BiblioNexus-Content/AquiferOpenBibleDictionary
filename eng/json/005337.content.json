They also have poison glands. The strength of the poison depends on the kind of spider. Some can kill only insects. Others can also kill birds and mice.</p><p>Most spiders have a pair of spinnerets. These are connected to silk glands under the abdomen. The spider uses them to make a web. In the Bible, a spider’s web is a picture of weakness and insecurity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:14\">Job 8:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa59:5-Isa59:6\">Isaiah 59:5–6</a>).</p>",
