The name means “tracks” and is believed to be located near Tamar, or Hazazon-tamar, several miles south of the Dead Sea. One possible reading of the text makes it the same as Tamar. The King James Version follows the Targum (an Aramaic translation of the Old Testament) and Vulgate (a Latin translation of the Bible) and translates it as “spies.”</p>",
