However, in the similar list found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:36\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:36</a>, the text says &quot;Bani, the Gadite&quot; instead of &quot;Mibhar, son of Hagri.&quot; Because of textual difficulties in the 1 Chronicles passage, scholars think the reading in 2 Samuel is probably more accurate.</p>",
