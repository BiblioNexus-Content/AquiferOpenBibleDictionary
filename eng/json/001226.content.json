Pinpointing the exact location has given rise to much unsettled debate. Some scholars think the word should be emended to Chapheltha, an equivalent of the area called the Mishneh, or Second Quarter (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:14\">2&nbsp;Kgs 22:14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph1:10\">Zep 1:10</a>, etc.). Others say Chaphenatha refers to “the bend of the fountain,” i.e., near the pool of Siloam. There is no decisive evidence either way.</p>",
