Ard, one of the nine sons, is called Benjamin’s son in the Hebrew sense, meaning descendant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:21\">Genesis 46:21</a>). He was the founder of the Ardite family, a smaller group within Benjamin’s larger tribe. In the book of 1 Chronicles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:3\">8:3</a>), Ard is called Addar. This difference in spelling is probably because of a mistake made when copying the text long ago.</p>",
