Obadiah was an important official who managed King Ahab’s household. Elijah met him after a long drought and asked him to bring Ahab to him. Both Ahab and Obadiah were looking for water and grass (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:3\">5</a>). Even though Obadiah worked for Ahab, he remained loyal to the Lord. He hid 100 prophets in caves and provided them with food and water.</p></li><li><p>A descendant of King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:21\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:21</a>). </p></li><li><p>A descendant of Izrahiah from Issachar’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:3\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:3</a>). </p></li><li><p>Azel’s son and a descendant of King Saul from Benjamin’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:38\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:44\">9:44</a>). </p></li><li><p>Son of Shemaiah, who was among the first Levites returning from exile to Jerusalem. He lived in one of the villages of the Netophathites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:16</a>). He is called Abda in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:17\">Nehemiah 11:17</a>. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2437\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Abda #2</span>. </p></li><li><p>A Gadite who joined David at his stronghold in the wilderness.

The Edomites had celebrated when Babylon defeated Jerusalem in 597 BC. Obadiah described the behavior of the Edomites in his prophecy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:11-Obad1:14\">Obadiah 1:11–14</a>). Obadiah&apos;s prophecy is the shortest book in the Old Testament. It predicted God’s judgment on Edom (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:2-Obad1:10\">2–10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:15\">15</a>). </p></li></ol><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6617\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Obadiah, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6999\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Prophet, Prophetess</span>.</p>",
