    "content": "<h1>OATH</h1><p>A solemn vow or promise to fulfill a pledge. </p><p>Two terms in Hebrew mean “oath”: </p><ol><li><p><em>‘ala</em></p></li><li><p><em>sebu’a</em> </p></li></ol><p>In ancient times, the term meant to enter a solemn, magical bond with the number seven. The ancient connections are now lost. Abraham and Abimelech swore an oath at Beersheba (the well of seven). As proof he dug a well, Abraham set aside seven ewe lambs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:31\">Genesis 21:22–31</a>). The former term <em>‘ala,</em> often translated as “oath,” properly means “curse.” At times, the two terms are used together (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:21\">Numbers 5:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:29\">Nehemiah 10:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:11\">Daniel 9:11</a>). Any breach of the oath would result in a curse. The Lord said that he had made a covenant and a curse with Israel—that is, breaking the covenant would be followed by a curse (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:14-Deut29:29\">Deuteronomy 29:14</a> and the following verses).</p><p>An oath was taken to confirm an agreement or, in a political situation, to confirm a treaty. In Israel and its neighbors, God (or the gods) guaranteed the agreement. His (or their) name was invoked for this purpose. When Jacob and Laban made an agreement, they erected a heap of stones as a witness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:53\">Genesis 31:53</a>). If either party transgressed the terms, it was a heinous sin. One of the Ten Commandments dealt with empty affirmations. It said, &quot;Y<span>ou shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who takes His name in vain</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:7\">Exodus 20:7</a>). The people of Israel were forbidden to swear their oaths by false gods (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer12:16\">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos8:14\">Amos 8:14</a>). To breach an international treaty, where the oath was taken in the Lord’s name, merited death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek17:16-Ezek17:17\">Ezekiel 17:16–17</a>). It was one of the complaints of Hosea that the people of his day swore falsely when they made a covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos10:4\">Hosea 10:4</a>). Judgment would attend such wanton disregard of the solemnity of an oath. Certain civil situations in Israel called for an oath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod22:10-Exod22:11\">Exodus 22:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev5:1\">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev6:3\">6:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num5:11-Num5:28\">Numbers 5:11–28</a>). This practice set a pattern for the Israelite covenantal oath of allegiance to God.</p><p>Christ taught that oaths were binding (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:33\">Matthew 5:33</a>). In the kingdom of God oaths would become unnecessary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:34-Matt5:37\">Matthew 5:34–37</a>). At his trial before Caiaphas, Jesus heard an oath from the high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:63-Matt26:65\">Matthew 26:63–65</a>). Paul swore by an oath on occasion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:23\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:20\">Galatians 1:20</a>). God himself was bound by his own oath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:18\">Hebrews 6:13–18</a>) to keep his promise to the patriarchs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:24\">Genesis 50:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:19-Ps89:37\">Psalms 89:19–37, 49</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1-Ps110:4\">110:1–4</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3842\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Covenant</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8189\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Vows</span>.</p>",
