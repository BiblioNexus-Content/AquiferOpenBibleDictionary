    "content": "<h1>BANI</h1><ol><li><p>A member of Gad’s tribe and warrior among David’s mighty men who were known as “the thirty” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:36\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:36</a>).</p></li><li><p>Shemer’s son and ancestor of Ethan. Ethan was the Levite of Merari’s line in charge of the music in the tabernacle during King David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:46\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:46</a>).</p></li><li><p>A member of the tribe of Judah and an ancestor of Uthai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:4\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:4</a>). Uthai was one of the first to move into Jerusalem after the exile in Babylon. Possibly the same as #4 below.</p></li><li><p>An ancestor of a family that returned to Judah with Zerubbabel after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:10\">Ezra 2:10</a>). It can also be spelled Binnui (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:15\">Nehemiah 7:15</a>).</p></li><li><p>An ancestor of a family that returned to Judah with Ezra after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:10\">Ezra 8:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Esd8:36\">1&nbsp;Esdras 8:36</a>). Possibly the same as #4 above.</p></li><li><p>An ancestor of some Israelites who were found guilty of marrying foreign women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:29\">Ezra 10:29</a>).</p></li><li><p>An ancestor of another group of Israelites who were found guilty of marrying foreign women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:34\">Ezra 10:34</a>).</p></li><li><p>The son or descendent of Bani (#7 above). He was among those found guilty of marrying foreign women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:38\">Ezra 10:38</a>). Because Bani is similarly spelled as “sons of” in Hebrew, most modern translations write verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:38\">38</a> “of the sons of Binnui.”</p></li><li><p>Rehum’s father and a Levite. Rehum repaired a section of the Jerusalem wall after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:17\">Nehemiah 3:17</a>).</p></li><li><p>The levitical assistant of Ezra who explained passages from the law read by Ezra to the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:7\">Nehemiah 8:7</a>). He gave praises to God on the steps of the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:4-Neh9:5\">Nehemiah 9:4</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:4-Neh9:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:4-Neh9:5\">5</a>). He is probably the same as Binnui (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:38\">Ezra 10:38</a>) and Anniuth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Esd9:48\">1&nbsp;Esdras 9:48</a>).</p></li><li><p>Another levitical assistant who explained passages from the law read by Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:4\">Nehemiah 9:4b</a>).</p></li><li><p>A levite who signed Ezra’s promise of faithfulness to God after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:13\">Nehemiah 10:13</a>). He was a leader of the people representing the Bani family mentioned under #4 above.</p></li><li><p>Uzzi’s father. Uzzi was the head of the levites in Jerusalem after the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:22\">Neh 11:22</a>). Possibly the same as #9 or #10 above.</p><p>The popularity of this name and its similarity to other Jewish names (e.g., Binnui) has caused much confusion in lists of ancestors. The list above is one of several possible arrangements.</p></li></ol>",
