    "content": "<h1>CHAFF</h1><p>Loose hulls separated from the edible grains by threshing and winnowing. In Bible times, winnowed grain was a common sight. The wind blew away the lighter husks, leaving only the grain. This gave rise to a strong metaphor. It symbolized that good people or nations would survive judgment, but the wicked would not. So, for example, sinners “<span>are like chaff driven off by the wind</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps1:4\">Psalm 1:4</a>).</p><p>The prophet Isaiah said of the Assyrians, “<span>You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble. Your breath is a fire that will consume you</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa33:11\">Isaiah 33:11</a>). In Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, the world&apos;s nations collapse and are like the chaff of the summer threshing floors before the victory of the coming kingdom of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:35\">Daniel 2:35</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament, it is said that the coming Messiah will “<span>gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:12\">Matthew 3:12</a>).</p>",
