The parallel passage in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:6</a> refers to this place as “the threshing floor of Nacon.” Following the death of Uzzah, King David renamed the place, &quot;Perez-uzzah.&quot; This means either “the breach of Uzzah” or “the outbreak against Uzzah” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:8\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr13:11\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:11</a>).</p><p></p>",
