    "content": "<h1>VALLEY OF REPHAIM</h1><p>The Valley of Rephaim is a geographical landmark that formed part of the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The King James Version calls it “the valley of the giants” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:8\">Joshua 15:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:16\">18:16</a>). It is a wide valley in the southwestern edges of Jerusalem. </p><p>People thought giants like the Anakim and the Nephilim often visited this valley. During King David&apos;s rule, the Philistine armies traveled from the coast to search for David in the Valley of Rephaim. This was after they heard David had been anointed king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:18-2Sam5:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:18–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr14:9\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:9</a>). </p><p>The Valley of Rephaim connected to the Wadi Serar, which led down to the Philistine coast. This valley was a fertile area where farmers grew grain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa17:5\">Isaiah 17:5</a>).</p>",
