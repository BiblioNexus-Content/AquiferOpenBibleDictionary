    "content": "<h1>HARVEST</h1><p>Harvesting is the gathering of crops, especially for food. In ancient Israel, different crops were harvested at different times of the year. Olives were picked from September to November, flax in March to April, barley in April to May, and wheat from May to June. Fruits like figs and grapes were harvested at the end of summer, in August or September. The Israelites&apos; calendar was centered around these harvest periods (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:1\">Judges 15:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth1:22\">Ruth 1:22</a>).</p><p>In the Old Testament, Pentecost was one of the three major festivals where Israelites gathered to celebrate the harvest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod23:16\">Exodus 23:16</a>). It was a time to remember that the land they had was a gift from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:7-Deut8:10\">Deuteronomy 8:7–10</a>). By offering the firstfruits of their harvest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:10-Lev23:11\">Leviticus 23:10–11</a>), they showed gratitude to God and acknowledged their dependence on him. They were also instructed to leave some of their harvest for those in need (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:9-Lev19:10\">Leviticus 19:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:22\">23:22</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament, the term &quot;harvest&quot; is often used figuratively. For example, in a parable, the harvest represents the final judgment, where angels separate the righteous from the wicked (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:24-Matt13:30\">Matthew 13:24–30</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:36-Matt13:43\">36–43</a>). In another instance, the harvest refers to people who have not yet heard the gospel, and the &quot;laborers&quot; are those who share it with them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:37-Matt9:38\">Matthew 9:37–38</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2592\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Agriculture</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Feasts and Festivals of Israel</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8182\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Vines, Vineyard</span>.</p>",
