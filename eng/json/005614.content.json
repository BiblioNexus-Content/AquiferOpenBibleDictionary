Since her father had no sons, she and her sisters asked for and received the inheritance of their father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:1\">Numbers 27:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh17:3\">Joshua 17:3</a>). This situation led to the creation of a new law about inheritance rights. The law stated that daughters who received their families&apos; inheritance must marry someone from within their own tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num36:11\">Numbers 36:11</a>).</p>",
