It was one of Israel’s last secure points on the route into Canaan, the Promised Land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20\">Numbers 21:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20\">20</a>). </p><p>Bamoth-baal, a mountain or high place, was probably a shrine to the Canaanite god Baal. King Balak of Moab took the prophet Balaam there to try to get him to curse Balak’s enemies, the people of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:41-Num23:13\">Numbers 22:41–23:13</a>).</p>",
