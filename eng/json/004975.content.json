    "content": "<h1>SERPENT</h1><p>A snake or sea monster. Various words are used in the Bible for serpents or snakes. Serpents, or snakes, are reptiles known for their ability to bite and inject venom. Specific types of snakes mentioned include the adder (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:8\">Isaiah 11:8</a>) and the viper (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:3\">Acts 28:3</a>). The term &quot;serpent&quot; can also describe a monstrous sea serpent found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:13\">Job 26:13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa27:1\">Isaiah 27:1</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:3\">Amos 9:3</a>.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1\">Genesis 3:1,</a>&nbsp;the serpent tempts Adam and Eve. It is &quot;<span>more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made</span>.&quot; As a result, the serpent is cursed: “<span>On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life.</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:14\">Genesis 3:14</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:3\">Second Corinthians 11:3</a>&nbsp;says the serpent deceived Eve with its cunning. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:9\">Revelation 12:9</a> calls the serpent: “<span>that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world</span>” (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:14-Rev12:15\">Revelation 12:14</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:14-Rev12:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:14-Rev12:15\">15</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:2\">20:2</a>).</p><p>Biblical references to serpents or snakes often use them figuratively. They represent the ability to harm with venom (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:17\">Genesis 49:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl10:8,Eccl10:11\">Ecclesiastes 10:8, 11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:29\">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos5:19\">Amos 5:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev9:19\">Revelation 9:19</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps58:4-Ps58:5\">Psalm 58:4</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps58:4-Ps58:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps58:4-Ps58:5\">5</a>, wicked people are compared to snakes. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps140:3\">Psalm 140:3 </a>describes people&apos;s tongues as sharp as serpents and their lips as poisonous as vipers. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov23:32\">Proverbs 23:32</a> likens strong drink to a serpent’s bite, saying it “<span>bites like a snake and stings like a viper</span>.” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer8:17\">Jeremiah 8:17</a> describes enemies of Israel as “<span>vipers that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you</span>.” </p><p>Positively, serpents are noted for their wisdom. Jesus advises his disciples, “<span>Be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:16\">Matthew 10:16</a>). However, the primary image of the serpent is negative. It symbolizes deceit. Jesus calls the scribes and Pharisees, “<span>You snakes! You brood of vipers</span>!” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:33\">Matthew 23:33</a>). John the Baptist also refers to the Pharisees and Sadducees as  “You brood of vipers!” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:7\">Matthew 3:7</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2782\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Animals</span>.</p>",
