    "content": "<h1>GALLIO</h1><p>Gallio was a Roman official in the first century AD. He was born in Cordoba, Spain, in 3 BC. His birth name was Marcus Annaeus Novatus. He died in AD 65. Gallio was the son of Marcus Annaeus Seneca and the older brother of the philosopher Seneca.</p><p>Gallio moved to Rome during the reign of the emperor Tiberius. Later, a famous public speaker named Lucius Junius Gallio adopted him. After that, Novatus took the name Gallio. Lucius Junius Gallio was a wealthy man. He trained Gallio for work in government and public service.</p><p>Gallio served as the Roman proconsul (governor) of Achaia between AD 51 and 53.</p><p>During the apostle Paul’s first visit to Corinth, some Jews brought a complaint against Paul. They told Gallio that Paul was teaching people to worship God in a way that was against the law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:12-Acts18:17\">Acts 18:12–17</a>). Gallio quickly rejected their complaint. He said the matter was about Jewish law, not Roman law. Gallio refused to judge a religious dispute. This response was typical of Roman governors. They often avoided getting involved in arguments about religion.</p><p>Gallio had to leave Achaia because he became sick. He later returned to Rome and served as <em>consul suffectus</em> (a temporary consul) under the emperor Nero. At some point, Gallio was connected to a plot against Nero. At first, Nero pardoned him. But later, Gallio was forced to take his own life.</p>",
