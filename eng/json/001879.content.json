Although, in each case, Erastus is a helper of the apostle Paul. The three mentions of Erastus in the New Testament are: </p><ol><li><p>A helper of Paul sent with the apostle Timothy into Macedonia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:22\">Acts 19:22</a>).</p></li><li><p>The city treasurer of Corinth, an official who managed finances. He might have been a slave or a wealthy freed slave and an important man in the Corinthian community. He sends greetings with Paul to the church in Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:23\">Romans 16:23</a>).</p></li><li><p>A friend of Paul who stayed at Corinth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:20\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:20</a>).</p></li></ol>",
