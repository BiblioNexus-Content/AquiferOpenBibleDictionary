The prophet Amos prophesied against Karnaim (also spelled Carnaim), foretelling its impending destruction on account of its wickedness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:13\">Am 6:13</a>).</p><p>It was the leading town in the area after the decline of its sister city, Ashtaroth, and became the main center of an Assyrian province in the seventh century BC. In 163 BC it was captured by Judas Maccabeus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:26,1Macc5:43-1Macc5:44\">1&nbsp;Macc 5:26, 43–44</a>). Christian and Jewish traditions believe it to be the home of Job.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2978\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Ashteroth-karnaim</span>.</p>",
