    "content": "<h1>HIVITES</h1><p>The Hivites were a group of people who lived in Canaan before the Israelites came. </p><p>Archaeologists and historians have not yet found clear evidence of the Hivites outside the Bible. But the Bible says they came from one of the sons of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:17\">Genesis 10:17</a>). They lived in areas around the Lebanon Mountains and Mount Hermon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:3\">Judges 3:3</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:3\"> 11:3</a>). </p><p>The Hivites appear many times in the Bible as a group that Israel drove out of the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:8\">Joshua 12:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:11\">24:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20\">1&nbsp;Kings 9:20</a>). But some of them stayed in the land. During the time of the Israelite kingdom, some Hivites still lived near the city of Tyre and in other places (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:7\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:7</a>).</p><p>Some scholars think the name “Hivite” may have come from a mistake in copying. In Hebrew, the letters <em>resh</em> (ר) and <em>waw</em> (ו) look similar. This mistake may have changed the name “Horite” to “Hivite.”</p><p>Some scholars think there may have been a mix-up in the names. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:2\">Genesis 36:2 </a>calls Zibeon a &quot;Hivite.&quot; In verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:20\">20</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:29\">29</a>, he is called a &quot;Horite&quot;. In some places, the Septuagint (an early Greek translation of the Old Testament) says “Horite” instead of “Hivite” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen34:2\">Genesis 34:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:7\">Joshua 9:7</a>). Other passages in the Septuagint read “Hittite” rather than “Hivite” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:3\">Joshua 11:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:3\">Judges 3:3</a>).</p><p>The overlap between the names Hivite and Horite in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:1-Gen36:43\">Genesis 36 </a>may show that the two groups were connected in some way. This is similar to how the Bible sometimes uses the names Ishmaelites and Midianites for the same group (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen37:27-Gen37:28,Gen37:36\">Genesis 37:27–28, 36</a>). Some scholars think the Hivites and Horites may have been related to the Hurrians. The Hurrians were a well-known group in history and archaeology.</p><p>The word “Hivite” appears about 25 times in the Old Testament. Almost one-third of these are in the book of Joshua. This suggests that the Hivites were a real group of people. Most Hivites lived in the land of Canaan, but some also lived in the land of Edom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:2\">Genesis 36:2</a>). </p><p>The Bible names several Hivites. These include:</p><ul><li><p>Hamor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen34:2\">Genesis 34:2</a>), </p></li><li><p>the people of Gibeon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:7\">Joshua 9:7</a>),</p></li><li><p>the northern Hivites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:3-Judg3:8\">Judges 3:3–8</a>), and </p></li><li><p>those who lived near Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:7\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:7</a>). </p></li></ul><p>When Solomon was king of Israel, the Hivites and other foreign people who lived in the land were forced to work as slaves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21\">1&nbsp;Kings 9:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr8:7\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:7</a>).</p>",
