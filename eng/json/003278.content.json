According to verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:23\">23</a>&nbsp;Kelaiah is also called Kelita. A Levite named Kelita is also found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:7\">Nehemiah 8:7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:10\">10:10</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Esd9:48\">1&nbsp;Esdras 9:48</a>, where he is one who helped Ezra in expounding the law and who set his seal on Ezraâ€™s covenant. It cannot be determined with certainty whether Kelaiah and Kelita are the same individual.</p>",
