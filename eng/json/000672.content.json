In around 830 BC it was owned by Mesha, the king of Moab. By the sixth century BC, it was still owned by the Moabites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:23\">Jeremiah 48:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:9\">Ezekiel 25:9</a>). It may have briefly been in Israelite possession during the eighth century BC.</p>",
