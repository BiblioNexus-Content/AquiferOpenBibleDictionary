After burning down the Tower of Shechem, Abimelech attacked Thebez but failed to capture the fortress inside the city. When the woman critically injured him with the millstone, Abimelech ordered his armor bearer to kill him. He did not want people to say that he had been killed by a woman.</p><p>Thebez was 17.7 kilometers (11 miles) northeast of Shechem. Today, it is traditionally identified with the modern town of Tubas.</p>",
