Zebedee was a fisher and may have been wealthy since he had servants and connections with the high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:15\">John 18:15</a>). Although he personally appears only once in the narrative (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:21\">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20\">Mark 1:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20\">â€“</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20\">20</a>), his wife, Salome, appears often as one of the believers who followed Christ.</p>",
