    "content": "<h1>REST</h1><p>Rest means freedom from work or activity. The Christian belief in rest comes from the rest of God himself. After completing the work of Creation in six days, God “<span>so on that day He rested from all His work</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:2\">Genesis 2:2</a>). This event provides the foundation for the Hebrew Sabbath, a weekly day of rest. The word &quot;sabbath&quot; itself means rest in Hebrew. The idea of resting on the seventh day is seen as part of the Creation order. The fourth commandment says to keep the Sabbath for God. Work for only six days. God made everything in six days and rested on the seventh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:8-Exod20:11\">Exodus 20:8–11</a>).</p><p>The biblical idea of rest is not just about the past (Creation) and the present (weekly rest). It is also about the future. This future rest is symbolized by the Israelites’ journey under Moses from slavery in Egypt to the &quot;rest&quot; of the Promised Land. They achieved this rest under Joshua, who led them into the land and settled them there (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh23:1-Josh24:33\">Joshua 23–24</a>).</p><p>The 40 years of wandering in the wilderness meant that the adults who left Egypt with Moses did not enter the Promised Land. They brought this judgment upon themselves due to their ingratitude and rebellion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:26-Num14:35\">Numbers 14:26–35</a>). Centuries later, God warned their descendants. He said not to be hard-hearted, or they might miss his rest. &quot;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:11\">Psalm 95:7–11</a>). The author of Hebrews quotes this passage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb3:8\">Hebrews 3:7–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:7\">4:7</a>) to show that God’s rest is not just a part of history. The promise of entering his rest is still open. The word “today” shows that the day of grace is still here: “For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later of another day. So then, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:8-Heb4:9\">Hebrews 4:8–9</a>).</p><p>Everyone is invited to enter into God’s rest. The weekly Sabbath is a reminder and a reflection of that rest. The rest the Israelites found in the Promised Land after their wandering is a symbol of God&apos;s eternal rest. His people will share in it. The rest that Christ offers to those who come to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:28\">Matthew 11:28</a>) is a glimpse and a promise of the divine rest that awaits them. The rest after death for believers who have “fallen asleep in Christ” is a deepened experience of this rest: “<span>Blessed are the dead—those who die in the Lord...they will rest from their labors</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:13\">Revelation 14:13</a>). But the complete fulfillment of this rest will occur when Christ returns. At that time, all who belong to him will fully reflect his likeness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:2\">1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>). Salvation will be complete. They will get imperishable, glorified bodies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:21\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5</a>). A renewed creation where righteousness dwells will be established (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:13</a>).</p><p>This moment will be the climax of history and the time when God’s people fully enter into his eternal rest. Christ&apos;s redemption, purchased on the cross, will be completed. It will bring rest and freedom from all sin. It also means freedom from all sorrow, pain, and death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:9-Rev7:17\">Revelation 7:9–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:7\">21:1–7</a>). Also, humanity will extend to all of God&apos;s creation. It will be perfected as originally intended (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:25\">Romans 8:19–25</a>).</p><p>Rest does not mean inactivity. God rested from the work of Creation. But, he is active. He sustains all he made. He carries out both righteous judgment and gracious salvation. Jesus Christ, through his life, death, resurrection, and glorification, is God in action (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:19</a>). As Jesus said, “<span>My Father is at His work, and I too am working</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:17\">John 5:17</a>). Christians will rest from the struggle against evil and the sufferings of this present life. However, the rest they enter into will not be boring or uneventful. God himself is dynamic, not static, and so is his rest.</p><p>As a result, all that a Christian rests from will allow them to be joyfully and continuously active in serving God, the Creator and Redeemer. In perfect harmony with all of God’s works, Christians will joyfully praise and serve the triune God. Their joy will be complete, without any lack or need for improvement (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:8-Rev4:11\">Revelation 4:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:8-Rev5:14\">5:8–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:9-Rev7:12\">7:9–12</a>). This will be the eternal Sabbath rest that has a beginning but no end: “<span>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:11\">Hebrews 4:11</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4922\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Heaven</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5945\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Lord’s Day, The</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7250\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Sabbath</span>.</p>",
