    "content": "<h1>BENJAMIN, Gate of</h1><p>One of the gates in Jerusalem’s old wall. The Gate of Benjamin was probably at the northeast corner, since the prophet Jeremiah went through it on his way to Benjamin, northeast of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer37:12-Jer37:13\">Jeremiah 37:12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer37:12-Jer37:13\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer37:12-Jer37:13\">13</a>). King Zedekiah held court there at least once (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:7\">Jeremiah 38:7</a>). It was opposite from the Corner Gate on the west wall (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:10\">Zechariah 14:10</a>). When the walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt at the end of the exile, a new gate called &quot;Sheep Gate&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:1,Neh3:32\">Nehemiah 3:1, 32</a>) or &quot;Muster Gate&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:31\">Nehemiah 3:31</a>) was built at the same site. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5501\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jerusalem</span>.</p>",
