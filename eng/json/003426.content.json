    "content": "<h1>LASCIVIOUSNESS</h1><p>Lasciviousness is a strong and uncontrolled desire for sensual pleasure. Modern Bible translations commonly use the words &quot;licentiousness,&quot; &quot;debauchery,&quot; or &quot;sensuality&quot; instead. Lasciviousness occurs when the pursuit of pleasure goes to the extreme of completely disregarding the dignity of other people and the environment.</p><p>The Bible gives several examples of this kind of behavior:</p><ul><li><p> The people of Sodom and Gomorrah lived in ways that went against God&apos;s laws (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:7\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:7).</a></p></li><li><p>Some false teachers told people they could do whatever they wanted. But these teachers themselves were controlled by their own wrong desires (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:2,2Pet2:18-2Pet2:19\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:2, 18â€“19</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:4\">Jude 4</a>). </p></li><li><p>Some non-Jewish people (gentiles) strongly desired to do all kinds of wrong things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:19\">Ephesians 4:19</a>). </p></li></ul><p>In his letters, Paul often wrote about people who could not control their sexual desires (&quot;debauchery&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:13\">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:21\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:19\">Galatians 5:19</a>). This is also likely what Jesus was talking about in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:22\">Mark 7:22</a>.</p>",
