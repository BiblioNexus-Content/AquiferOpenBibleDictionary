God chose Aaron, Moses&apos; brother, to be the first high priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:3\">Exodus 28:1–3</a>). Only one person could be high priest at a time. This position was usually passed down within Aaron&apos;s family.</p><p>The high priest had special duties that other priests could not do. His most important task happened once a year on the Day of Atonement. The high priest would enter the most holy part of the temple to ask God&apos;s forgiveness for all the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:19\">Leviticus 16:1–19</a>).</p><p>The high priest wore special clothes that showed his important role. These included beautiful robes and a breastplate with twelve precious stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:12-Exod28:15\">Exodus 28:12–15</a>). He also carried special objects called &quot;Urim&quot; and &quot;Thummim&quot; that were used to learn God&apos;s will for the people.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>.</p>",
