The scientific name of the algum tree is Juniperus excelsa Bieb. </p><p>People used algum wood in building projects during ancient times. Algum was used to build the temple and the palace, as well as musical instruments. The timber from Lebanon mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:8</a>) is probably the juniper tree. Algum wood may have also been brought from Ophir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr9:10-2Chr9:11\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:10â€“11</a>). </p><p>Some Bible translators believe that &quot;algum&quot; and &quot;almug&quot; are different Hebrew spellings of the same tree (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 2:8</a>, marginal note). Others suggest the word &quot;algum&quot; might be an error made by someone copying the word &quot;almug&quot; incorrectly.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2692\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Almug</span>.</p>",
