Epaphroditus was sent to the apostle Paul during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment; his mission was to deliver gifts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:18\">Phil 4:18</a>) and to assist the apostle in his work (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:25\">2:25</a>). While in Rome, Epaphroditus became seriously ill and nearly died. After a period of convalescence, he returned to Philippi with Paul’s letter instructing the church to receive him (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:29\">29</a>). Epaphroditus’s devoted service endeared him to the Philippian believers and to Paul, who termed him “brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier” (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:25\">25</a>, rsv).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6878\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Philippians, Letter to the</span>.</p>",
