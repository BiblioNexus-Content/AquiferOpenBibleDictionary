    "content": "<h1>MERIBBAAL</h1><p>Meribbaal was the original name for Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan who could not walk (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:34\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:40\">9:40</a>). The name Meribbaal means &quot;Baal contends.&quot; In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam4:4\">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:4</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam9:6\">9:6</a>, he is called by the later name Mephibosheth, which means &quot;idol breaker.&quot; This change in name happened because the word &quot;baal&quot; (which means &quot;lord&quot;) later became associated with idol worship. When this happened, the Israelites often replaced &quot;baal&quot; in names with &quot;bosheth,&quot; which means &quot;shame.&quot; This was a common practice (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:21\">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:21</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6223\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mephibosheth #1</span>.</p>",
