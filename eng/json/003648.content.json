Because of this, plant experts believe it refers to one of the species of saltwort or orach.</p><p>Twenty-one species of saltwort grow in Israel and the surrounding areas. Almost all of these are common plants that could match what the Bible describes. <em>Atriplex halimus</em> is the species most commonly suggested. It is a strong-growing bushy shrub related to spinach. </p><p></p>",
