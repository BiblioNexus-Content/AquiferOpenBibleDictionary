    "content": "<h1>LIBYA, LIBYANS</h1><p>A country and its residents to the west of Egypt. In ancient Hebrew texts, three different words were used to describe Libya and its people. These words can be confusing to understand today for two reasons. First, some of the ancient texts are unclear. Second, writers from long ago often used the word &quot;Libya&quot; when talking about any part of Africa that was not Egypt.</p><p>From the 12th century BC, Libyans served in the armies of Egypt and Ethiopia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:3\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:8\">16:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah3:9\">Nahum 3:9</a>). One of their most famous leaders was Shishak, who came from Libya. He later became a powerful ruler who invaded other lands. </p><p>The prophet Ezekiel said Libya would be defeated along with other nations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek30:5\">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). The book of Daniel also mentions that the Libyans were among the people who were conquered (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:43\">Daniel 11:43</a>). The book of Isaiah briefly mentions the Libyans, calling them by their Hebrew name &quot;Pul&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:19\">Isaiah 66:19</a>).</p><p>A man named Simon, who was from a city called Cyrene in Libya, was forced by Roman soldiers to carry Jesus&apos;s cross on the day Jesus was crucified (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:32\">Matthew 27:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:21\">Mark 15:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:26\">Luke 23:26</a>). Cyrene is in eastern Libya. Later, when the Holy Spirit came to Jesus&apos;s followers at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, people from Libya were among the large crowd that gathered there. (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:10\">Acts 2:10</a>).</p>",
