Some Jewish people who had been forced to live away from their homeland during exile in Babylon came back from Addan to Jerusalem with Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:59\">Ezra 2:59</a>). It was probably named after a Babylonian god called Addu. Some exiles from this city could not prove their Jewish descent because they lost their family records. It is also spelled Addon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:61\">Nehemiah 7:61</a>).</p>",
