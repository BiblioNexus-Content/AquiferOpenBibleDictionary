Cup-bearers frequented the courts of kings and high officials in antiquity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:5\">1&nbsp;Kgs 10:5</a>). These men were close to those in authority and sometimes exercised considerable influence. Generally several of them served the king with the “chief cup-bearer” (butler) at&nbsp;their head (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen40:1-Gen40:23\">Gn 40:1–23</a>). Solomon’s court included cup-bearers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr9:4\">2&nbsp;Chr 9:4</a>), and Nehemiah was the king’s cup-bearer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:11-Neh2:1\">Neh 1:11–2:1</a>); Rabshakeh may have been a cup-bearer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:13-2Kgs18:19\">2&nbsp;Kgs 18:13–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa36:2\">Is 36:2</a>).</p>",
