    "content": "<h1>ATHALIAH</h1><ol><li><p>The wife of King Jehoram of Judah, and daughter of King Ahab of Israel and his wife, Jezebel. Athaliah was Judah’s only queen. She ruled 841–835 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:1-2Kgs11:21\">2&nbsp;Kings 11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:1-2Chr23:21\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22–23</a>).</p><p>Like her mother Jezebel, Athaliah worshiped Baal, a Canaanite god. She encouraged her husband to do the same. Athaliah had a strong influence on Jehoram. After he died, their son Ahaziah became king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:25-2Kgs8:27\">2&nbsp;Kings 8:25–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:1\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:1</a>). Like his father, Ahaziah was influenced by Athaliah and did “<span>evil in the sight of the LORD</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:27\">2&nbsp;Kings 8:27</a>).</p><p>Because the kings of Israel and Judah disobeyed God, He chose Jehu to be the true king of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:2-2Kgs9:3\">2&nbsp;Kings 9:2</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:2-2Kgs9:3\">3</a>). Jehu killed Joram, king of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:24\">2&nbsp;Kings 9:24</a>), and Ahaziah, king of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:27\">2&nbsp;Kings 9:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:9\">2&nbsp;Chr 22:9</a>). </p><p>After her son died, Athaliah took the throne of Judah. She tried to kill all the males in the royal family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:1\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:10\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:10</a>). But Jehoshabeath, Jehoram’s daughter and the wife of Jehoiada, the priest, rescued Ahaziah’s son Joash. She hid him away from Athaliah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2-2Kgs11:3\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:2</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2-2Kgs11:3\">3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:11-2Chr22:12\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 22:11</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:11-2Chr22:12\">12</a>).</p><p>After six years, Jehoiada “<span>strengthened himself</span>” and decided to reveal young prince Joash to the people. He made a deal with some mercenaries brought to Jerusalem: “<span>the Levites...and the heads of the families of Israel</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr23:1-2Chr23:3\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr23:1-2Chr23:3\">3</a>). In a secret ceremony in the temple, Joash was crowned king. </p><p>Athaliah heard people celebrating and blowing trumpets and tried to stop what was happening by tearing her clothes and yelling, “Treason!” She was immediately taken from the temple area and executed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:13-2Kgs11:16\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:13</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:13-2Kgs11:16\">16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr23:12-2Chr23:15\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 23:12</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr23:12-2Chr23:15\">15</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5757\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Kings, Books of First and Second</span>.</p></li><li><p>One of the sons of Jehoram from the tribe of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:26\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:26</a>).</p></li><li><p>The father of Jeshaiah, who led the sons of Elam who were returning from Babylon with Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:7\">Ezra 8:7</a>).</p></li></ol>",
