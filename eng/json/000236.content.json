Judas Maccabeus freed Jews from this city who were surrounded by unfriendly gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:24-1Macc5:35\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:24</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:24-1Macc5:35\">35</a>). Most experts think Alema was about 25 to 35 miles (40 to 55 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee. It might be where the modern city of Alma in Gilead is today. Helam, where King David won an important battle, might be the same as Alema (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16-2Sam10:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:16</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16-2Sam10:17\">17</a>).</p>",
