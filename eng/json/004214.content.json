    "content": "<h1>OINTMENT</h1><p>Various mixes for medicinal use. Most ointments have an oil base, mixed with spices or herbs. Most Palestinians used olive oil for ointments. Olive oil itself was considered an ointment. The Old Testament does not distinguish between &quot;oil&quot; and &quot;ointment.&quot; </p><p>In Egypt and Mesopotamia, various vegetable oils and animal fats were used for ointments. People also used other vegetable oils, including castor oil, sesame oil, linseed oil, radish oil, colocynth oil, and oil from various nuts.</p><p>Ointments were important in ancient times. In the hot and dry climate of the Near East, ointments were used to protect and heal the skin. All classes used ointments for medicinal purposes, soothing qualities, and masking odors. The Old Testament mentions apothecaries or perfumers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam8:13\">1&nbsp;Samuel 8:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:14\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 16:14</a>). Some artisan makers organized into guilds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:8\">Nehemiah 3:8</a>).</p><h2>How Were Ointments Made?</h2><p>In general, people made ointments by heating aromatic plants or spices in oil (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job41:31\">Job 41:31</a>). Perfumed ointments were combinations of certain materials with specially prepared oil. In the Old Testament, descriptive words like &quot;fragrant&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:3\">Song of Solomon 1:3</a>) or &quot;precious&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl7:1\">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>) mean perfumed oils. Many types of containers could store ointments, but people preferred flasks made of alabaster. An alabaster jar held the expensive ointment Mary used to anoint Jesus in Bethany (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:3\">Mark 14:3</a>).</p><h2>How Were Ointments Used?</h2><p>Ointments had many uses. Among the Jewish people, ointments held important meaning. Holy anointing oil consecrated Aaron, his sons, the tabernacle, and its furnishings. Anointing oil was made of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia mixed with olive oil (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:23-Exod30:25\">Exodus 30:23–25</a>). Oil was also used to anoint kings and prophets, but not the same holy anointing oil mixture.</p><p>As a cosmetic, perfumed ointments controlled unpleasant odors. Oil was applied to the body (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam12:20\">2&nbsp;Samuel 12:20</a>), clothing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:8\">Psalms 45:8</a>), or personal objects (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov7:17\">Proverbs 7:17</a>). Women used ointments for cleansing and enhancing the attractiveness of skin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth2:12\">Esther 2:12</a>). The fragrance of certain ointments attracted the attention of the opposite sex (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:10\">Song of Solomon 4:10</a>). Song of Songs has several references to fragrant ointments.</p><p>Using ointments to refresh and soothe guests was a mark of hospitality in the ancient Near East. The Egyptians used cones of ointment. They placed the cones on the heads of guests to drip down over the body (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps133:2\">Psalms 133:2</a>). As a sign of respect and honor, hosts anointed the heads of guests with oil. Jesus chided a Pharisee who neglected this traditional mark of hospitality (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:37-Luke7:40\">Luke 7:37–40</a>). Mary anointed Jesus with a costly flask of nard, a fragrant ointment obtained from the roots of an aromatic herb from India (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:3\">Mark 14:3</a>).</p><h3>Ointments Used for Burial</h3><p>Burial processes used anointing oils. In the New Testament, a corpse would be washed and anointed with ointments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:1\">Mark 16:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:37\">Acts 9:37</a>). Then, attendants wrapped the body in linen garments with spices and ointments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:56\">Luke 23:56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:40\">John 19:40</a>). Both the Jews and the Romans used nard for burials. A mixture of myrrh and aloes was used for Jesus&apos;s burial.</p><h3>Ointments Used as Medicine</h3><p>Medicinal uses of ointment were common:</p><ul><li><p>Oil was applied to wounds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:34\">Luke 10:34</a>). </p></li><li><p>Healing ointments called balm included aromatic gums or resins. Gilead is associated with healing balm (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer8:22\">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). </p></li><li><p>Palestine exported balm for trade (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen37:25\">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:17\">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). </p></li><li><p>The city of Laodicea produced and exported a famous eye ointment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:18\">Revelation 3:18</a>). </p></li><li><p>Ointments were an important trade item for merchants in the Roman period (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev18:13\">Revelation 18:13</a>).</p></li><li><p>Anointing with oil came to be associated with gladness and joy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:7\">Psalms 45:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:3\">Isaiah 61:3</a>). </p></li><li><p>People refrained from anointing during times of mourning (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam14:2\">2&nbsp;Samuel 14:2</a>). </p></li><li><p>The lack of oil for anointing was viewed as judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic6:15\">Micah 6:15</a>). </p></li><li><p>Shields were anointed with oil to make them supple and possibly to help deflect weapons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:21\">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:21</a>).</p></li></ul><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6640\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Oil</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6929\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Plants</span> (<span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6648\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Olive, Olive Tree</span>).</p>",
