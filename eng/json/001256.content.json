    "content": "<h1>CHERITH, The Brook</h1><p>A brook or valley where the Lord told the prophet Elijah to hide from King Ahab. This happened during a time when there was no rain and very little food in the land, which Elijah had predicted would happen. While Elijah stayed by this stream, he had water to drink, and God sent birds (ravens) to bring him food every morning and evening (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:2-1Kgs17:6\">1&nbsp;Kings 17:2â€“6</a>). </p><p>The stream was located east of the Jordan River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:3\">1 Kings 17:3</a>). Some people think it was in a valley called Wadi Qelt, near the city of Jericho. However, it was more likely in the region of Gilead, where Elijah came from. The Brook of Cherith is sometimes called the &quot;Cherith Valley&quot; or &quot;Cherith Ravine.&quot;</p>",
