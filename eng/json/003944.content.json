Here he built an altar to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:6\">Gn 12:6</a>). Later, Moses mentioned this place as a geographical landmark to identify the whereabouts of Mt Gerizim and Mt Ebal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut11:30\">Dt 11:30</a>). The kjv improperly reads “plain” of Moreh. The oak of Moreh was located near Shechem.</p>",
