    "content": "<h1>TIMNAH (Place)</h1><p>1. One of the cities on the northern boundary of Judah’s inheritance, located between Beth-shemesh and Ekron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:10\">Jos 15:10</a>). This is the likely site of Judah’s affair with Tamar, which resulted in the birth of Perez and Zerah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:12-Gen38:14\">Gn 38:12–14</a>). A frontier town between Judah and Philistia, Timnah was the place where Samson had his first marital difficulties with one of the daughters of the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:1-Judg14:5\">Jgs 14:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:6\">15:6</a>). The town evidently changed hands frequently between the Israelites and the Philistines. Apparently, Israel did achieve control of Timnah during the conquest (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:43\">Jos 19:43</a>), but it was under Philistine control by the time of Samson (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:1\">Jgs 14:1</a>). Ahaz recaptured Timnah (c. 730 BC) from the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18\">2&nbsp;Chr 28:18</a>).</p><p>2. One of the cities of the southern hill country that was part of the inheritance of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:57\">Jos 15:57</a>). It is possible that this is the site of Judah’s encounter with Tamar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:12-Gen38:14\">Gn 38:12–14</a>; and perhaps the same as #1 above).</p>",
