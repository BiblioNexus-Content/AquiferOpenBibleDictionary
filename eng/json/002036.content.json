    "content": "<h1>FOREORDINATION</h1><h2>What is Foreordination?</h2><p>God&apos;s activity of deciding events and outcomes before they happen. People often use &quot;foreordination&quot; and &quot;predestination&quot; to mean the same thing. However, &quot;predestination&quot; and &quot;election&quot; specifically refer to the destiny of people.</p><p>Many early church fathers wrote about foreordination. Augustine of Hippo, who lived from 354 to 430, emphasized foreordination in his teachings. Augustine greatly influenced the Protestant Reformers, especially John Calvin. Reformed theologians start studying foreordination by looking at God&apos;s eternal decree, as shown in statements of belief like the Westminster Confession of Faith. God&apos;s decree is one, but people usually talk about it as &quot;the decrees of God&quot; to help explain it. Martin Luther believed in foreordination but didn&apos;t stress it as much as Calvin. Luther&apos;s teachings don&apos;t say much about foreordination, mainly discussing predestination or election. Modern Lutheran thought emphasizes conditional election, rather than absolute election. This means they believe election or predestination is based on faith that God sees ahead of time.</p><h2>Foreordination in God&apos;s Plan</h2><p>Foreordination is the foundation of God&apos;s whole plan: his decision to create the universe, to care for it (providence), and to determine its destiny “by the counsel of His will&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:11\">Ephesians 1:11</a>). The Westminster Shorter Catechism explains it like this: God has decreed “his eternal purpose according to the counsel of his will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.” So, foreordination is at the base of all Christian teaching, because it is about the history and destiny of the whole world, the universe, and everything in it.</p><p>The apostle Paul spoke of God’s plan for the fulfillment of all creation: “The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but because of the One who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:21\">Romans 8:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:21\">21</a>). Scripture describes briefly the redemption of creation. It talks about &quot;<span>a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:13</a>). The things that harm human life and come from human sinfulness (that is, depravity) will end. God will make “all things new”, so God is in control of the destiny of everything (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:5\">Revelation 21:1–5</a>).</p><h2>Challenges and Debates</h2><p>Foreordination creates problems for theology and commonsense thinking. This is especially true of human freedom and responsibility concerning salvation. How can people be held responsible for their actions and decisions if they are already predetermined? Some deny God’s foreordination concerning human freedom to remove that difficulty. When God created humans with free will (that is, the ability to make choices that are not determined by anyone or anything else), some argue that God necessarily limited his control over events that &quot;must&quot; happen. Otherwise, free and responsible human activity has no meaning. Calvinism rejects this argument, insisting that free activity is possible even though it is foreordained and known of before it happens.</p><p>Denying foreordination implies that God does not control his creation. If that were true, human activity would be determined either by something above or beyond God, or by unknown causes. God’s providence and care revealed in the Bible and human experience make such a view difficult to defend. Christian thought generally states that God foreordains and controls his creation and that humans are able to act freely and responsibly within that larger control. This appears contradictory because human understanding is limited.</p><h2>Foreordination in Scripture</h2><p>The Bible often mentions foreordination (including predestination, or election) and foreknowledge. Foreordination is logically prior to foreknowledge, but since both are eternal in God, no such priority exists.</p><p>When he spoke of Babylon&apos;s coming judgement, God said, “This is the plan devised for the whole earth, and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations. The LORD of Hosts has purposed, and who can thwart Him? His hand is outstretched, so who can turn it back?” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:26-Isa14:27\">Isaiah 14:26</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:26-Isa14:27\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:26-Isa14:27\">27</a>). God also declared that he had already determined the end since the beginning. “My purpose will stand, and all My good pleasure I will accomplish” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa46:10\">Isaiah 46:10</a>). Paul stated that God carries out his purposes “by the counsel of His will” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:11\">Ephesians 1:11</a>; compare with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:89-Ps119:91\">Psalm 119:89</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:89-Ps119:91\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps119:89-Ps119:91\">91</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan4:35\">Daniel 4:35</a>).</p><p>The Bible also says: </p><ul><li><p>a person&apos;s life span is determined (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job14:5\">Job 14:5</a>) </p></li><li><p>God’s concern extends to his creatures (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:14-Ps104:30\">Psalm 104:14</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:14-Ps104:30\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:14-Ps104:30\">30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:29\">Matthew 10:29</a>) </p></li><li><p>the hairs on our heads are numbered (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:30\">Matthew 10:30</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, God&apos;s plan extends to peoples and nations, for “from one man He made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:26\">Acts 17:26</a>).</p><p>God knows and even uses people’s evil acts for his purposes. Joseph’s brothers sinned by selling him into slavery. Joseph later said, “As for you, what you intended against me for evil, God intended for good, in order to accomplish a day like this—to preserve the lives of many people.” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:20\">Genesis 50:20</a>). </p><p>Another example is when Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus. Jesus said, “The Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:22\">Luke 22:22; </a>“Son of Man“ is a title Jesus used to refer to himself). On the day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter said, “He [Jesus] was delivered up by God’s set plan and foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:23\">Acts 2:23</a>; compare with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:27-Acts4:28\">4:27</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:27-Acts4:28\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:27-Acts4:28\">28</a>) </p><p>Paul refers to God’s determining authority over Pharaoh’s acts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:17\">Romans 9:17</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:17\">Revelation 17:17</a> says, “God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose”. So, God foreordains history, and even evil acts fulfill his purposes.</p><p>Election of sinners to salvation through Christ is included in God’s foreordination (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:39\">Romans 8:28</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:39\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:39\">39</a>; compare with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:48\">Acts 13:48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:12-Phil2:13\">Philippians 2:12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:12-Phil2:13\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:12-Phil2:13\">13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a>). God’s plan of salvation is based on his eternal love (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:3-Eph1:14\">Ephesians 1:3</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:3-Eph1:14\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:3-Eph1:14\">14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:11\">Romans 5:6</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:11\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:11\">11</a>). Christians receive God’s grace by knowing God and being known (that is, loved) by God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:9\">Galatians 4:9</a>). Both election and believers&apos; faith are part of the salvation process.</p><h2>Foreordination and Providence</h2><p>Foreordination is implied in providence or God’s care. Providence is the achievement of God’s plan for the world. God’s care and control for creation show his plan of redemption for humanity made in his image. God controls history, but God is not responsible for sin. He created human beings to be able to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to him. But God’s plan cannot be stopped. It continues despite opposition. God’s ultimate plan is happening throughout all events of human history, both evil and good. But his sovereignty is not imposed without reason or fairness. God is not a tyrant but rather is holy, loving, and righteous. His plan is carried out according to his nature, shown in care and concern for creation and in steadfast love for sinners.</p><p><em>Natural law </em>is the set of rules God has established (foreordained) to control the universe. What about destructive forces of nature, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes? Why are such apparent evils necessary in a world made by a loving God? This does not suggest that God is unable to control nature. If life’s full meaning was found in the earthly, physical world, this might be a problem. But God’s ultimate purpose is more than only the present life and includes the fullness of the redemptive kingdom yet to come (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev11:15\">Revelation 11:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:4\">21:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:4\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:4\">4</a>). Foreordination is a great mystery, but it should bring joy and comfort to believers whose loving Lord has revealed his great plan to them.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4149\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Elect, Election</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4458\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Foreknowledge</span>.</p>",
