During Paul&apos;s third missionary journey, his ship anchored opposite Chios between stops at Mitylene and Samos as he traveled to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:15\">Acts 20:15</a>). Although the island was not very fertile, Chios was known for producing wine, figs, and gum mastic. The island is separated from the mainland by a strait that is 8 kilometers (5 miles). In Paul&apos;s time, the main city on the island, also called Chios (modern Scio), was a free city in the Roman province of Asia.</p>",
