    "content": "<h1>ADUMMIM</h1><p>A pass stretching from the hill country into the Jordan Valley and which formed part of Judah&apos;s northern border (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:7\">Joshua 15:7</a>). This place also helps locate Geliloth on Benjamin&apos;s southern border (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:17\">Joshua 18:17</a>). The road from Jerusalem to Jericho went through this mountain pass. </p><p>Jerome, a church father, believed that this was where Jesus&apos;s story of the good Samaritan took place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:30-Luke10:37\">Luke 10:30</a><span>â€“</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:30-Luke10:37\">37</a>). The modern Arabic name means &quot;ascent of blood.&quot; The Hebrew name Adummim, meaning &quot;red rocks,&quot; likely comes from the natural color of the rocks, not from the fate of many travelers who were robbed there.</p>",
