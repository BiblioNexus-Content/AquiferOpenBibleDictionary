It was usually the strongest and safest place in the city where people could go when they were in danger.</p><p>Gideon destroyed the citadel of Penuel after he captured two Midianite kings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:17\">Jgs 8:17</a>). Abimelech and his men burned down the citadel of El-berith at Shechem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49\">9:46–49</a>). After, a woman in the citadel at Thebez dropped a millstone on Abimelech&apos;s head and crushed his skull (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:50-Judg9:54\">50–54</a>). David conquered Jerusalem by capturing its citadel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:7-2Sam5:9\">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:5-1Chr11:8\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:5–8</a>).</p><p>In the second century BC, during the time when the Maccabees fought for freedom, the citadel in Jerusalem was an important place that helped whoever was in power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc1:29-1Macc1:33\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 1:29–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc11:41-1Macc11:42\">11:41–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc13:49-1Macc13:51\">13:49–51</a>). The last major citadel in Jerusalem was called the Fortress of Antonia. The Romans captured it in AD 70.</p>",
