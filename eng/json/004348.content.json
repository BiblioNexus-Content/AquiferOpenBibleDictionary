    "content": "<h1>PATHROS</h1><p>The region of Upper Egypt, mentioned five times in the Hebrew OT (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:11\">Is 11:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer44:1,Jer44:15\">Jer 44:1, 15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek29:14\">Ez 29:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek30:14\">30:14</a>). Each time it occurs in conjunction with a city in Lower Egypt (Noph = Memphis, or Zoan = Tanis). The Hebrew is Pathros<em>,</em> and the Egyptian is <em>pa to resy</em> (“the Southern Land”). Egyptologists believe that the Hebrew form is a corruption of <em>Pethoris</em> or <em>Pethores.</em> <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:11\">Isaiah 11:11</a> suggests that Mitsrayim is to be equated with Lower and Middle Egypt, and Pathros is the region south of it up to the border of Cush (i.e., Upper Egypt). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek29:14\">Ezekiel 29:14</a>, Pathros is the original home of the Egyptians. The prophets spoke about God’s judgment on Pathros: “I will lay waste Upper Egypt [“Pathros,” mg], set&nbsp;fire to Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek30:14\">Ez 30:14</a>, niv). After the exile, Jews migrated to Egypt and some settled in Pathros. Jeremiah warned that God’s judgment on Egypt was to come and that they would not escape it: “This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt [Pathros]: ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins’ ” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer44:1-Jer44:2\">Jer 44:1–2</a>, niv).</p>",
