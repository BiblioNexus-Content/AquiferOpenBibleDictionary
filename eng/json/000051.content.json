After David’s death, Adonijah asked his half-brother, King Solomon, to marry Abishag. At that time, to take the concubine of a deceased king was to claim you were the next king (a concubine is a woman who lived with a man and had a relationship like a wife but without the full rights of marriage). Adonijah&apos;s request made Solomon angry and he ordered Adonijah to be killed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:13</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25\">25</a>).</p>",
