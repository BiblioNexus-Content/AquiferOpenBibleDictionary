    "content": "<h1>JEDAIAH</h1><p>1. Shimri’s son and the father of Allon. He is listed in the genealogical tables of the Simeonites who settled in the valley of Gedor in Hezekiah’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:37\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:37</a>).</p><p>2. Harumaph’s son, who helped repair the Jerusalem wall after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:10\">Neh 3:10</a>).</p><p>3. Aaron’s descendant and head of the second of the 24 priestly divisions for temple service in David’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:7\">1&nbsp;Chr 24:7</a>). His descendants are listed among the returned exiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:10\">1&nbsp;Chr 9:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36\">Ezr 2:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:39\">Neh 7:39</a>). The individuals and families listed below are probably a part of this priestly line, but their exact relationships are difficult to determine.</p><p>4. Provincial priest who agreed to resettle in postexilic Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:10\">Neh 11:10</a>; cf. v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:2\">2</a>).</p><p>5. Priest who returned with Zerubbabel after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:6-Neh12:7\">Neh 12:6–7</a>). In the next generation this was the name of a family (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:21\">21</a>).</p><p>6. One of the exiles taken by Zechariah as witness to the symbolic crowning of Joshua (nlt “Jeshua”). He may be the same as #4 or #5 above. He came back from captivity bringing gifts for the temple in the days of the high priest Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech6:10-Zech6:14\">Zec 6:10–14</a>).</p>",
