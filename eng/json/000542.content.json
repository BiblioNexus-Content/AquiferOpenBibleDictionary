    "content": "<h1>ASHTAROTH, ASHTERATHITE</h1><p>A town of Bashan, which was the home of King Og, as well as Edrei (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut1:4\">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:10\">Joshua 9:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:4\">12:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:12,Josh13:31\">13:12, 31</a>). </p><p>Ashtaroth is the plural form of Ashtoreth, the name of a Canaanite fertility goddess who was worshiped there. After Og was defeated by the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:1-Deut3:11\">Deuteronomy 3:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:1-Deut3:11\">11</a>), Moses gave Ashtaroth to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:12,Josh13:31\">Joshua 13:12, 31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:13\">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>). Later, it became a Levitical city inhabited by the Gershonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:71\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:71</a>). </p><p>Ashteroth-karnaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:5\">Genesis 14:5</a>) is probably the same town as Ashtaroth. Its location is usually identified as modern-day Tell Ashtarah, 21 miles or 34 kilometers east of the Sea of Galilee. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:44\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:44,</a> one of David’s mighty men, Uzzia, is called an Ashterathite.</p>",
