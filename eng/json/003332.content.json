Upon the return from the exile, Nehemiah set the families to work, each building a part of the wall. Fountain Gate is recorded as being near the pool of Siloam by the king’s garden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:15\">Neh 3:15</a>). It is not certain whether the site now called the king’s garden outside the walls of modern Jerusalem is the original site.</p>",
