Because this system was based on the sunâ€™s movement, the length of an hour varied with the seasons. An hour was longer in summer and shorter in winter.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3943\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Day</span>.</p>",
