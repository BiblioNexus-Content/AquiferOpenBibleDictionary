    "content": "<h1>PLAGUE</h1><p>A word used to refer to a disease, disaster, or pestilence (<span>a widespread disease resulting in many deaths)</span>. &quot;Plague&quot; in Scripture does not mean a specific disease. It refers to multiple diseases (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:37\">1&nbsp;Kings 8:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:21\">Luke 7:21</a>). &quot;Plague&quot; can mean an epidemic disease or widespread disaster. It can refer to the ten plagues of Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod7:1-Exod12:51\">Exodus 7–12</a>).</p><p>The Hebrews believed plagues were part of God&apos;s judgment on people. God threatened to send plagues to the Israelites for their sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:21\">Leviticus 26:21</a>) and took full responsibility for the Egyptian plagues (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:5\">Joshua 24:5</a>). The Old Testament plagues demonstrated God’s control over the processes of nature, just as Christ’s miracles do in the New Testament.</p><p>At one point in the history of Israel, the Philistines won a battle and captured the ark of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:10-1Sam4:11\">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:10–11</a>). When the ark was kept at Ashdod, God showed his power. A fatal disease with swellings or tumors spread (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:6\">1 Samuel 5:6</a>). The Philistines sent the ark on to Gath, but people of all ages began to have tumors in the region of the groin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:9\">1 Samuel 5:9</a>). A similar occurrence at the next city, Ekron, resulted in many deaths (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:12\">1 Samuel 5:12</a>).</p><p>After seven months, the Philistines decided to return the ark of God to Israel. They included a guilt offering of five golden rats and five golden tumors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:1-1Sam6:4\">1&nbsp;Samuel 6:1–4</a>). They chose this unusual offering because the Philistine prophets linked the plague on them to the swarms of rodents that infested the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:5\">1 Samuel 6:5</a>). The first Israelite village to receive the ark of God from the Philistines was punished for looking into it. They got the same disease (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:19\">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). The sickness in Beth-shemesh left 50,070 people dead.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4374\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Exodus, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6845\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pestilence</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6925\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Plagues upon Egypt</span>.</p>",
