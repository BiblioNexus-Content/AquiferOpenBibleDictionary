    "content": "<h1>TEMAN (Place)</h1><p>In the prophetic writings, Teman seems to have been considered the principal city of Edom and is often used as a poetic parallel for the entire land of Edom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer49:7,Jer49:20\">Jer 49:7, 20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:12\">Am 1:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:9\">Ob 1:9</a>). Since Teman means “south,” it is likely that Teman was located in the far south of Edom; however, its precise location remains unknown. The residents of Teman were evidently well known for their wisdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer49:7\">Jer 49:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Obad1:9\">Ob 1:9</a>). This reputation may well derive from Eliphaz the Temanite, who was one of Job’s counselors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:11,Job2:4\">Jb 2:11, 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job15:1\">15:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job22:1\">22:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:9\">42:7–9</a>).</p>",
