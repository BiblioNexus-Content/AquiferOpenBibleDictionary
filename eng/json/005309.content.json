    "content": "<h1>SONG OF DEBORAH</h1><p>The Song of Deborah is an ancient poem found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 5</a>. It celebrates an Israelite victory over the Canaanites. This song is similar to Moses&apos;s song  in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:18\">Exodus 15:1–18</a>. It also tells the same story as the prose account in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24\">Judges 4. </a>The song describes how the Israelites defeated the powerful Canaanite king Jabin of Hazor and his general Sisera with God&apos;s help. The song&apos;s poetic style and use of old Hebrew forms can be seen in the slightly different translations found in modern Bible versions. The poem&apos;s strong language suggests that an eyewitness to the battle wrote it, probably Deborah herself.</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:2\">Judges 5:2</a> addresses Israel with an invitation to praise God. The song also tells foreign kings to learn about Israel&apos;s God and what he did. Verses<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:4-Judg5:5\"> 4–5</a> may describe the current battle or God&apos;s earlier appearance to Moses at Mount Sinai. Verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:5\">5</a> could be translated, “The mountains quaked at the presence of the One of Sinai.”</p><p>Deborah is first introduced in verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:7\">7</a>. Verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:8\">8</a> might mean that the Canaanites stopped the Israelites from openly carrying weapons. More likely, it means the Canaanites had destroyed all weapon-making in Israel (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam13:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:19</a>). During a time of fear and division, Deborah, who was a judge, urged the Israelite tribes to fight. When Deborah asked all the tribes for help, some did not respond, but others came to assist.</p><p>The battle took place at Taanach, 24.1&nbsp;kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Mount Tabor. The Canaanites had gathered their forces there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:13\">Judges 4:13</a>). This meant the Israelites lost the advantage of fighting from their mountain position. However, Deborah&apos;s song suggests that God helped them, possibly through a strong storm. </p><p>God&apos;s help is also mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:14\">Judges 4:14</a> (“<span>Has not the LORD gone before you?&quot;</span>). The song describes stars fighting against Sisera and the river Kishon flooding. These represent natural forces helping Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:20-Judg5:21\">Judges 5:20–21</a>). Also, the Canaanites&apos; chariots lost their advantage when Jael, a brave Hebrew woman, killed Sisera, the chariot leader (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:24-Judg5:27\">Judges 5:24–27</a>). Sisera&apos;s death fulfilled Deborah&apos;s prophecy to Barak, the Israelite commander. A woman, not he, would receive glory for that deed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:9\">Judges 4:9</a>).</p><p>The song shows Sisera&apos;s mother sadly waiting for him to return. In contrast to this sad picture of the Canaanite woman, Deborah&apos;s song ends with a strong prayer for future safety. Although Jael was blessed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:24\">Judges 5:24</a>) and Deborah was praised, the God of Israel received the glory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:3\">Judges 5:1–3</a>).</p>",
