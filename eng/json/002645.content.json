    "content": "<h1>HOOPOE</h1><p>A hoopoe is one of the most colorful birds in the Holy Land (<em>Upupa epops</em>). It has pinkish-brown feathers, black and white bands on its back, tail, and wings, and a crown-shaped crest of feathers that stands up when the bird is alarmed. It has a long, thin, curved bill. The hoopoe is about 28 centimeters (11 inches) long and usually lives in dry areas.</p><p>The name “hoopoe” comes from the sound of the bird’s call. To make this call, the hoopoe puffs up the feathers on its neck and snaps its head into the air. On the ground, it uses its bill to hammer into the soil.</p><p>The hoopoe arrives in the Holy Land in February, breeds in the summer, and leaves in September. Ancient Egyptians held the bird in religious honor. In the law of Moses, it was listed as ceremonially unclean (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:19\">Leviticus 11:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut14:18\">Deuteronomy 14:18</a>). This was probably because it looks for grubs and insects in unclean places such as piles of dung.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3418\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Birds</span>.</p>",
