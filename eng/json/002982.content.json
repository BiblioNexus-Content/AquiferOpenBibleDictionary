    "content": "<h1>JASON</h1><p>1. Jewish high priest (174–171 BC) who brought about the decline of the priesthood by Hellenizing Jerusalem, making her inhabitants “citizens of Antioch” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc4:9-2Macc4:50\">2&nbsp;Macc 4:9ff</a>.). He was deposed by his cousin Onias Menelaus, but when a false report told of the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, Jason attacked Jerusalem without mercy for his own people. Antiochus, returning from an aborted attack on Egypt, retook Jerusalem and Jason was forced to flee to Transjordan and thence from city to city. Second Maccabees reports that at his death, “[Jason] who had cast out many to lie unburied had no one to mourn for him; he had no funeral of any sort and no place in the tomb of his fathers” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc5:10\">5:10</a>, rsv).</p><p>2. Jewish Christian at Thessalonica who hosted Paul and&nbsp;Silas (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:1,Acts17:5-Acts17:9\">Acts 17:1, 5–9</a>). He and others were called before the city officials on charges of harboring seditionists. He was released when he put up bail.</p><p>3. Christian at Corinth who, along with Paul, sent greetings to the church at Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:21\">Rom 16:21</a>).</p>",
