    "content": "<h1>ACHAN, ACHAR</h1><p>A member of the tribe of Judah who kept some of the loot from the Israelite victory at Jericho, disobeying Joshua’s orders and God’s commands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh7:1\">Joshua 6:1–7:1</a>). </p><p>Later, Israel was defeated at Ai, a weaker city than Jericho. This defeat showed Joshua that God was angry. With God’s help, Joshua discovered which Israelite had disobeyed. Achan confessed that he had buried a robe and some gold and silver from Jericho in his tent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh7:20-Josh7:22\">Joshua 7:20</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh7:20-Josh7:22\">22</a>). The stolen loot was found and taken to the valley of Achor (meaning “trouble”), where Achan and his family were killed. </p><p>In the Hebrew text, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:7\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:7</a> gives Achan’s name as Achar (meaning “disaster”) because he “<span>brought trouble upon Israel by violating the ban on devoted things.”</span></p>",
