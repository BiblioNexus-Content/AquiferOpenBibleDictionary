    "content": "<h1>KIDNEY</h1><p>A kidney is an internal organ of the body. In the Bible, kidneys had both a physical and spiritual meaning.</p><p>In ancient Israel, God commanded that the kidneys of sacrificial animals, along with their fat, be burned as offerings on the altar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod29:13\">Exodus 29:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev3:4-Lev3:15\">Leviticus 3:4â€“15</a>). This was part of God&apos;s instructions about which parts of animals could and could not be eaten. The Israelites were not allowed to eat blood, and the kidneys represented this restriction.</p><p>The Bible also uses the kidneys as a symbol for a person&apos;s deepest thoughts and feelings. Hebrew writers often mentioned kidneys alongside the heart and soul to describe someone&apos;s inner self or true character (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps73:21\">Psalm 73:21</a>). They believed the kidneys were the place where people made moral choices and thought deeply about life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps16:7\">Psalm 16:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer12:2\">Jeremiah 12:2</a>). The Hebrew word for kidneys is often translated as &quot;heart.&quot;</p><p>In the Old Testament, God knows everyone&apos;s deepest thoughts (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps7:9\">Psalms 7:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps26:2\">26:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer20:12\">Jeremiah 20:12</a>). So, Jesus was identified in the book of Revelation as &quot;<span>the One who searches minds and hearts</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:23\">Revelation 2:23</a>). This indirectly but clearly identifies Jesus with God. This is the only reference to the kidneys in the New Testament.</p>",
