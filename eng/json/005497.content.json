King David took a large amount of bronze from this city during battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:8\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:8\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:8</a>). Hadadezer was the king of Zobah, an area located in the Hamath region in Syria. Because of this connection, Tebah was probably located somewhere in that same region.</p>",
