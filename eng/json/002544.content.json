    "content": "<h1>HEMORRHAGE</h1><p>A flow of blood coming from a cut&nbsp;or nosebleed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov30:33\">Proverbs 30:33</a>). </p><p>In Scripture, it&nbsp;mostly refers to menstruation. Laws about normal and abnormal menstruation are given&nbsp;in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev15:19-Lev15:30\">Leviticus 15:19</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev15:19-Lev15:30\">30</a>. A woman with normal menstruation was unclean for seven days, as well as anything she touched. Any&nbsp;woman who bled longer than seven days was unclean&nbsp;as long as she was bleeding, plus seven additional days.</p><p>All the Gospels except John tell the story of Jesus miraculously healing the woman who had bled for 12 years (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:20-Matt9:22\">Matthew 9:20</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:20-Matt9:22\">22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:25-Mark5:34\">Mark 5:25</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:25-Mark5:34\">34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:43-Luke8:48\">Luke 8:43</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:43-Luke8:48\">48</a>). By touching Jesus’s clothing, the woman violated the Old Testament laws about menstruation, as she was making Jesus’s garment unclean (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev15:1-Lev15:33\">Leviticus 15</a>). Her act of faith in Jesus healed her.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
