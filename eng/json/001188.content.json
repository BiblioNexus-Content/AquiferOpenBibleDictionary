The bark of cassia is used as a spice that tastes similar to cinnamon but is not as high quality. </p><p>The &quot;cassia&quot; mentioned in the Bible comes from the cassia bark tree (<em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>). It is one of the ingredients used in holy anointing oil (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:24\">Exodus 30:24</a>). It was also a valuable trade item (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:19\">Ezekiel 27:19</a>). comes from the cassia bark tree (<em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>). </p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps45:8\">Psalm 45:8</a>, the reference seems to be to a different plant called Indian orris (<em>Saussurea lappa</em>).</p><p></p>",
