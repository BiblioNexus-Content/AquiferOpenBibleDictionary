    "content": "<h1>MOSES’S SEAT</h1><p>A phrase that appears only in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:2\">Matthew 23:2</a>. There, Jesus talks about the scribes and Pharisees sitting on Moses&apos;s Seat.</p><p>In Bible times, where someone sat often showed how important they were (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:6\">Matthew 23:6</a>). Sitting on &quot;Moses&apos;s Seat&quot; meant having a respected position and the right to explain Moses&apos;s laws.</p><p>The scribes were seen as continuing Moses&apos;s authority. People looked to them to explain what Moses taught.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:2\">Matthew 23:2</a>, Jesus does not seem to question their right. He tells people to follow what the scribes and Pharisees say when they teach Moses&apos;s laws correctly. But Jesus warns people not to copy what these teachers do because the scribes and Pharisees do not practice what they preach.</p><p>At other times, Jesus spoke against the scribes&apos; and Pharisees&apos; traditions that did not match Moses&apos;s laws (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:3-Matt15:6\">Matthew 15:3–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:4\">23:4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:16-Matt23:22\">16–22</a>).</p>",
