The ship of the apostle Paul passed Lasea on its way to Italy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:8\">Acts 27:8</a>). </p><p>We do not know much about Lasea. It is probably in ruins near Fair Havens. It may be the same as the Lasos mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his <em>Natural History</em> (4.12.59). Pliny says Lasea was famous in the ancient world. Its region contained 100 cities and it was one of most important ports of Crete.</p>",
