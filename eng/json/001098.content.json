    "content": "<h1>BROTHERS OF JESUS</h1><p>The brothers of Jesus were James, Joses (also called Joseph), Simon, and Judas. The New Testament names them as members of Jesus&apos;s own family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:55\">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:3\">Mark 6:3</a>). Jesus&apos;s brothers and mother Mary visited him while he was teaching (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:47-Matt12:50\">Matthew 12:47–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:34-Mark3:35\">Mark 3:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:19-Luke8:21\">Luke 8:19–21</a>). During this visit, Jesus taught that everyone who follows God&apos;s will becomes part of his family.</p><h2>Jesus&apos;s Family in the Gospels</h2><p>The people of Nazareth knew Jesus&apos;s family well. When Jesus came to teach there, they said, “Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:3\">Mark 6:3</a>). </p><p>In Matthew’s Gospel, the order of the names of the last two brothers is reversed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:55\">Matthew 13:55</a>). When Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum, Mary and his brothers went with them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:12\">John 2:12</a>). Just before the Feast of Tabernacles the brothers visited Jesus to persuade him to go to Jerusalem for the festival. Although they were skeptical about his miracles, they said he should show his powers in public to gain recognition (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:4\">John 7:4</a>). </p><p>Jesus acknowledged opposition from within his family when he said, <span>“Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor”</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:57\">Matthew 13:57</a>). When crowds began following Jesus, his brothers and friends from his hometown thought he was acting strangely. (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:21\">Mark 3:21</a>).</p><h2>Leaders in the Early Church</h2><p>Later, the brothers changed their minds about Jesus and became important leaders in the early church in Jerusalem. They joined Mary in regular prayer meetings, showing they now believed in Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:14\">Acts 1:14</a>). Jesus appeared to James after his resurrection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:7\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:7</a>). When Paul visited Jerusalem after becoming a follower of Jesus, he met with Peter and James, “the Lord’s brother,” but not the other apostles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:19\">Galatians 1:19</a>). When the apostle Peter was released from prison, he went to the home of Mary the mother of John Mark. Despite the excitement of the occasion, he immediately asked the group to “<span>Send word to James and to the brothers</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:17\">Acts 12:17</a>).</p><p>James became a respected leader in the Jerusalem church(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:13-Acts15:21\">Acts 15:13–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:18\">21:18</a>). In the council at Jerusalem, he expressed a strong opinion on the acceptance of gentiles (non-Jewish people) into the church. He was later visited by Paul, who told him about his ministry and the many conversions among the gentiles. </p><p>Although James is mentioned more often by name, all the brothers seem to have been well respected at that time. Paul used their actions as an example when he argued that it would be appropriate for him also to have a wife accompany him on his journeys, as Jesus’s brothers did (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor9:5\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:5</a>).</p><p>The author of the Letter of James is generally assumed to be the Lord’s brother. Although he does not identify himself specifically that way (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:1\">1:1</a>). It seems clear that the author wrote as a recognized leader in the church. To identify him as the Lord’s brother seems logical. </p><p>The author of the Letter of Jude identifies himself as the brother of James. The reference would most logically be to James, the leader mentioned in Acts and probably the author of the other letter. The author thus seems to be the Judas named as the brother of the Lord in the Gospels (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:55\">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:3\">Mark 6:3</a>).</p><p>The New Testament clearly separates Jesus&apos;s brothers from the twelve apostles (Jesus&apos;s specially chosen followers). Luke named the apostles and then said, “<span>With one accord they all continued in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:13-Acts1:14\">Acts 1:13–14</a>). The apostle Paul referred to the brothers of the Lord as a group separate from the apostles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor9:5\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:5</a>). Each mention of them in the Gospels describes them as family members and distinct from the disciples.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5370\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">James (Person) #1</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5617\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Joseph #7</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5657\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jude (Person)</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6129\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mary #1</span>.</p>",
