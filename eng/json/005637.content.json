    "content": "<h1>TOLA</h1><p>1. One of the four sons of Issachar named among the 66 descendants of Jacob who accompanied him in the migration to Egypt to join Joseph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:13\">Gn 46:13</a>); and the ancestor of the first of four families of the tribe of Issachar, as identified in the census of Israel undertaken by Moses and Eleazar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:23\">Nm 26:23</a>). Tola’s sons were Uzzi, Rephaiah, Jeriel, Jahmai, Ibsam, and Shemuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:2\">1&nbsp;Chr 7:2</a>). The Israelite clan of the Tolaites took its name from him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:23\">Nm 26:23</a>), and during the time of David the warriors of his family numbered 22,600 men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:1-1Chr7:2\">1&nbsp;Chr 7:1–2</a>).</p><p>2. One of the judges of Israel, the son of Puah and the grandson of Dodo (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:1\">Jgs 10:1</a>), of Issachar’s tribe. Shamir, his home and burial place, was in the hill country of Ephraim. There he judged Israel for 23 years.</p><p>Although he “delivered” Israel after the debacle of Abimelech’s abortive attempt to establish a monarchy at Shechem, his accomplishment is covered in just two verses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:1-Judg10:2\">Jgs 10:1–2</a>). Like other “minor judges,” mentioned only briefly (e.g., <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:8-Judg12:15\">12:8–15</a>), he actually functioned in the judicial role—some more prominent “judges” (e.g., Gideon and Jephthah) were first, and perhaps solely, military heroes.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5658\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judges, Book of</span>.</p>",
