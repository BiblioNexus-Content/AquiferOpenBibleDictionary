    "content": "<h1>APHEK</h1><ol><li><p>A Canaanite city west of the Jordan River. It was conquered by Israel and later included in Ephraim’s territory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:18\">Joshua 12:18</a>). It was located near the source of the Yarkon River in the plain of Sharon. Aphek was later captured by the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1\">29:1</a>). In Roman times, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and named it Antipatris. It is mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:31\">Acts 23:31</a>. Its modern name is Ras el-‘Ain. <em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2811\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Antipatris</span>.</p></li><li><p>A place in Phoenicia (modern Lebanon). It remained unconquered after Joshua’s campaigns (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:4\">Joshua 13:4</a>). This Aphek was probably located near the source of the river Ibrahim, east of Byblos.</p></li><li><p>A town given to Asher’s tribe in the distribution of conquered cities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:30\">Joshua 19:30</a>). Asher’s tribe failed to drive out the pagan inhabitants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:31\">Judges 1:31)</a>. Here it is spelled “Aphik”. Aphek was located on the plain of Acco. This is the present site of Tell Kurdaneh near the source of the river Na’main.</p></li><li><p>A city east of the Jordan River. It is on the main highway between Damascus and the valley of Jezreel. The Syrian king Ben-hadad was defeated by King Ahab of Israel. Ben-hadad retreated into Aphek. Here a falling wall demolished the rest of his army (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:26,1Kgs20:30\">1&nbsp;Kings 20:26, 30</a>). A&nbsp;century later Elisha prophesied to King Joash of Israel that he would defeat the Syrians in the same city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:17\">2&nbsp;Kings 13:17</a>).</p></li></ol>",
