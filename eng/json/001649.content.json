    "content": "<h1>DROPSY</h1><p>An old medical term for an excess of watery fluid in any tissue or space of the body. </p><p>Dropsy, mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:2\">Luke 14:2</a>,  is a symptom of serious disorders, like heart, kidney, or liver disease. Jesus healed a man &quot;who had dropsy,&quot; but his illness is not described. The word &quot;dropsy&quot; is now outdated. It has been replaced with more specific medical terms:</p><ul><li><p>Dropsy in the stomach is now called <em>ascites</em></p></li><li><p>Dropsy in or below the skin is called <em>edema</em></p></li><li><p>Dropsy in the lungs is now called <em>hydrothorax</em></p></li></ul><p>Dropsy is not mentioned directly in the Old Testament. A reference to swollen feet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:4\">Deuteronomy 8:4</a>) could refer to <em>pedal edema</em> or simply to blisters.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
