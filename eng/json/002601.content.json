    "content": "<h1>HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMALEKITES</h1><p>An area near Pirathon in Ephraim, probably about 9.6 kilometers (six miles) west of Shechem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:15\">Judges 12:15</a>). It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible but not in the Greek manuscripts of the Old Testament. Some scholars find the reference confusing. However, it is possible that an argument based on <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14\">Judges 5:14</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:15\">12:15</a> can be made that there was a small Amalekite district in Ephraim.</p><p>The hill country of the Amalekites is sometimes called the &quot;mount of the Amalekites.&quot;</p>",
