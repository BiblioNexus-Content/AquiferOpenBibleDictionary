    "content": "<h1>NETOPHAH, NETOPHATHITE</h1><p>Netophah was a place near Bethlehem in the Old Testament. A Netophathite was someone who came from that place.</p><p>Two of David’s thirty mighty warriors came from Netophah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:28-2Sam23:29\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:28–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:13-1Chr27:15\">27:13–15</a>). Seraiah, one of the army leaders who met Gedaliah after Jerusalem fell to Babylon in 586 BC, was also a Netophathite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23\">2&nbsp;Kings 25:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer40:8\">Jeremiah 40:8</a>).</p><p>Later, 56 men from Netophah returned from exile in Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:22\">Ezra 2:22</a>).</p><p>Levites also lived in the villages of the Netophathites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:16\">1 Chronicles 9:16</a>). Temple singers came from villages around Jerusalem, including those near Netophah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:28\">Nehemiah 12:28</a>). These verses suggest that Netophah was not just a town but part of a larger area or district.</p><p>Netophah was likely located near Bethlehem (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:54</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:26\">Nehemiah 7:26</a>). We do not know the exact location, but many believe it was at Khirbet Bedd Faluh, about 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) southeast of Bethlehem.</p>",
