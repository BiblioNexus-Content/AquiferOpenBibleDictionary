    "content": "<h1>ADONI-BEZEK</h1><p>The title of the Canaanite king of Bezek, a city in northern Palestine. After Joshua died, the tribes of Judah and Simeon defeated Adoni-bezek and cut off his thumbs and big toes. Adoni-bezek had done the same thing to many kings he had captured. He admitted that what happened to him was a just punishment from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:5-Judg1:7\">Judges 1:5</a><span>â€“</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:5-Judg1:7\">7</a>). Some argue that Adoni-bezek and Adoni-zedek, who is mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:1\">Joshua 10:1,</a> were the same person.</p>",
