The &quot;tumbleweed&quot; mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps83:13\">Psalm 83:13</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa17:13\">Isaiah 17:13</a> likely refer to the Palestinian tumbleweed (<em>Gundelia tournefortii</em>). This plant belongs to the thistle family. It is a prickly herb that contains a milky juice. When it dries, it breaks off and rolls across the land, often gathering in large piles in low areas.</p>",
