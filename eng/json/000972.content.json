    "content": "<h1>BILHAH (Person)</h1><p>Servant given by Laban to his daughter Rachel when she married Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:29\">Gn 29:29</a>). Realizing her own childlessness, Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband as a concubine and accepted their two sons as her own, naming them Dan and Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:3-Gen30:8\">30:3–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:25\">35:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:25\">46:25</a>). Archaeological investigation has confirmed the custom of a barren wife’s providing a concubine to guarantee children to her husband. Such an arrangement is mentioned in marriage contract documents dug up at Nuzi and dated from about the same time as the <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:1-Gen29:35\">Genesis 29</a> events. Jacob’s son Reuben was later guilty of incest with Bilhah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:22\">35:22</a>).</p>",
