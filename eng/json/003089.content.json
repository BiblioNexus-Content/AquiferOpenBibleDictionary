    "content": "<h1>JESHURUN</h1><p>A poetical name for Israel. It is possibly derived from the Hebrew root meaning “upright.” According to many scholars, it is a diminutive of Israel. A diminutive is a version of a word or an ending added to a word to make it smaller, such as &quot;little Israel.&quot; </p><p>The name Jeshurun is used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:15\">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:5,Deut33:26\">33:5, 26</a>. In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the word is not translated as a proper name but as an adjective, “beloved.” In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:2\">Isaiah 44:2,</a>&nbsp;Jacob is described as “<span>Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.</span>” This links the name with the idea of election or choosing. </p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:5\">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>&nbsp;Israel is reminded that “the LORD became king in Jeshurun.&quot; Verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:26\">26</a> says, <span>“There is none like the God of Jeshurun.&quot;</span> If we follow the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament), there is a link with the term “beloved” used of Christ in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:17\">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:11\">Mark 1:11</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:6\">Ephesians 1:6</a>, and of the church in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:4\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:13</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:1\">Jude 1:1</a>.</p>",
