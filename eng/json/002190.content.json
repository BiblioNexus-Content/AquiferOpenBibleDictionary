The parallel list in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:25\">Nehemiah 7:25</a> reads “sons of Gibeon,” suggesting that “Gibbar” may be a textual corruption. Some support for this view lies in the fact that <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:21\">Ezra 2:21</a> begins listing descendants by their home city rather than by family.</p>",
