Around 166–165 BC, Antiochus went to fight the Parthians and left Lysias in charge of Syria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:31-1Macc3:37\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 3:31–37</a>). Lysias sent generals Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias to bring Judas Maccabeus under control in Judea. Then he himself led an attack on&nbsp;Judas. <br><br>At last, Antiochus Epiphanes signed and approved a peace treaty (2&nbsp;Maccabees 11). The agreement ended the harsh laws against the Jews. After that, Judas cleaned the temple and started the daily sacrifices again. </p><p>In 164 BC, Antiochus Epiphanes died. Lysias returned to Judea with the young king Antiochus V Eupator. They defeated Judas Maccabeus at Bethzacharia and began to attack Jerusalem. However, trouble in Antioch forced them to go back to Syria. There, in 162 BC, Demetrius I took power. He had both Lysias and Antiochus V put to death.</p></li></ol>",
