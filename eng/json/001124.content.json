They lived in Rome and in other parts of the Roman Empire.</p><p>The apostle Paul greeted &quot;<span>those from the household of Caesar</span>” in one of his letters (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:22\">Philippians 4:22</a>). Caesar was the title of the emperor of Rome. The emperor’s household had hundreds of workers. Many of their jobs were respected and important in Roman society.</p><p>When Paul arrived in Rome, many people from Caesar’s household welcomed him. This is reported in a second-century writing called the Martyrdom of Paul. Paul also spoke with Jewish leaders in Rome and taught openly about Jesus. He preached without being stopped (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:17,Acts28:31\">Acts 28:17, 31</a>). Some men and women believed his message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:23-Acts28:24\">Acts 28:23–24</a>). Some of these new believers were likely from Caesar’s household. The message about Jesus even reached the whole Praetorian Guard (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:13\">Philippians 1:13</a>), a special group of Roman soldiers who guarded the emperor. </p><p>Some Bible scholars believe that certain people mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27\">Romans 16</a> may have also belonged to the emperor’s household.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3548\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Caesars, The</span>.</p>",
