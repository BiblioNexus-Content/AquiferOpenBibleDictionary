Ahihud helped Eleazar and Joshua divide the territory of Canaan between the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:17,Num34:27\">Numbers 34:17, 27</a>).</p></li><li><p>Some English Bible versions (King James Version, Revised Standard Version) say Ahihud was a leader in the tribe of Benjamin. They say his father was Gera, also called Heglam, who was sent away to live in Manahath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:7\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:7</a>). <br><br>But the Hebrew text (called the Masoretic Text) says Ahihud&apos;s father was Ehud. In this version, it was Gera who forced Ahihud and his mother to leave their home and go to Manahath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:6</a>).</p></li></ol>",
