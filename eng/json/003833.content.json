The name means &quot;Bridle of the Mother City.&quot; This place was most likely the Philistine capital city called Gath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:1\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:1</a>). In ancient times, people often called a capital city a &quot;mother&quot; city and the smaller surrounding cities were called &quot;daughters.&quot; The word &quot;bridle&quot; in the name shows control or authority, meaning that whoever controlled this city had power over the whole region.</p>",
