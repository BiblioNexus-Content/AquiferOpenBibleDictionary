Hostile toward Palestinian Jews who refused to accept Greek ways, Antiochus Eupator sent his vice-regent Lysias with 80,000 troops to solicit compliance. Maccabeus and his band, led by an angel, wrecked Lysiasâ€™s expedition and evoked a settlement that permitted Jews to maintain their ancestral customs. However, Hieronymus and fellow district governors Timothy, Apollonius, and Demophon would not allow the Jews to&nbsp;live in peace and quiet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc12:2\">2&nbsp;Macc 12:2</a>).</p>",
