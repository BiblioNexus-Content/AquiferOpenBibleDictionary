Fortunatus is a Roman proper name written in Greek and found only once in the NT (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:17\">1&nbsp;Cor 16:17</a>). Paul rejoiced that he, along with Stephanas and Achaicus, had come to be with him in Ephesus. The Textus Receptus has a subscript naming these three men as the carriers of Paulâ€™s letter to the Corinthians.</p>",
