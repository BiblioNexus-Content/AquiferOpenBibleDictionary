When Antiochus attacked the city of Dor, the high priest Simon Maccabeus tried to help Antiochus by sending him 2,000 soldiers, gold and silver, and military equipment. But Antiochus refused these gifts and broke all agreements with Simon. He then sent a man named Athenobius to Jerusalem. Athenobius told Simon to either give Antiochus control of several strong places or pay a lot of money. If Simon did not do either, Antiochus threatened to attack. Simon offered to pay only one-tenth of what Antiochus asked for. Athenobius went back to Antiochus very angry about this. As a result, Antiochus sent his general, Cendebeus, to attack Judea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:38-1Macc15:41\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:38</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:38-1Macc15:41\">41</a>).</p>",
