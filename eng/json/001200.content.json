Cendebeus was ordered to build a fortress at Kedron (probably the Gederah of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:36\">Jos 15:36</a>), after which he transferred his headquarters to Jamnia and from there made raids into Judea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:39-1Macc15:40\">1&nbsp;Macc 15:39–40</a>). Simon Maccabeus, unable to fight back because of his old age, dispatched his sons Judas and John Hyrcanus against Cendebeus with 20,000 soldiers and horsemen. Judas was wounded, but the Jews prevailed after slaying about 2,000 men. Cendebeus was pursued back to Kedron, and the Jews returned to Judea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc16:1-1Macc16:10\">16:1–10</a>).</p>",
