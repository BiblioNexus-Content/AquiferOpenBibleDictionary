    "content": "<h1>LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</h1><p>A title of the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen leader) that appears only in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:5\">Revelation 5:5</a>: “<span>The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed.</span>” This is a reference to the promise of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:9-Gen49:10\">Genesis 49:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:9-Gen49:10\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:9-Gen49:10\">10</a>, “Judah is a young lion.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span>The scepter will not depart from Judah.</span>” </p><p>The expression summarizes the Old Testament hope that the Messiah would conquer and deliver his people from every form of spiritual, political, and social evil (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Esd11:37\">2&nbsp;Esdras 11:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Esd12:31\">12:31</a>). The Old Testament often uses the lion as a symbol of power and the ability to defeat their enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job10:16\">Job 10:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps10:9\">Psalm 10:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:10\">Ezekiel 1:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:1-Dan7:4\">Daniel 7:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:1-Dan7:4\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:1-Dan7:4\">4</a>).</p><p>The author of Revelation says that all Christians believe that Christ will defeat all the powers of evil. However, unlike the Old Testament hope, Christ will not come as a conquering Lion of military power but as the Lamb, who suffers and is sacrificed for the sins of his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:6\">Revelation 5:6</a>).</p>",
