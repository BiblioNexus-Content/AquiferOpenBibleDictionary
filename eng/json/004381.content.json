    "content": "<h1>PELUSIUM</h1><p>City known for its flax and wine, but also a strategic fortified town on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, situated on the trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek30:15-Ezek30:16\">Ez 30:15–16</a>). Today the site is called Tell Farama and is located about 20 miles (32.2&nbsp;kilometers) southeast of Port Said. The Hebrew OT uses the old Egyptian name for the town, Sin<em>,</em> meaning “fortress.” Some English translations of the OT (kjv) use this English name. When the Greeks controlled Egypt, they renamed the town Pelusium, “the muddy city,” apparently confusing the Egyptian name with a similar Egyptian word <em>sin,</em> meaning “mud” or “clay.” In Ezekiel it is called “the stronghold of Egypt” because it provided a defense against the ever-present danger of attack from the north.</p>",
