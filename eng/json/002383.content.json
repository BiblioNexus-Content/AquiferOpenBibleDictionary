Later in Israel’s history John Hyrcanus erected a Maccabean fortress on this spot, which Pompey destroyed in 63 BC. Still later, Herod the Great built the Tower of Antonia here to oversee the temple area. Two prophecies refer to the Tower of Hananel as a boundary point in the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:38\">Jer 31:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:10\">Zec 14:10</a>).</p>",
