It was located between Punon and Iye-abarim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:10-Num21:11\">Numbers 21:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:43-Num33:44\">33:43–44</a>). Its exact location is uncertain. Some scholars have attempted to identify Oboth with ‘Ain el-Weiba, which is 53.1&nbsp;kilometers (33 miles) south of the Dead Sea in the Arabah Valley. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p>",
