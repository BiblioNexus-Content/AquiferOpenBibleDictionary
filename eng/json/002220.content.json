    "content": "<h1>GIRZITES</h1><p>People living in southwest Canaan who were raided by David when at Ziklag (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8\">1&nbsp;Sm 27:8</a>, kjv “Gezrites”). The Hebrew text has girzi<em>,</em> while the marginal variant transposes two consonants to read gizri<em>,</em> “Gezrites.” The Greek version follows the Hebrew marginal variant. The confusion of the name is obviously early. If “Gerzites” is the original, they could have been a Canaanite tribe living in the Mt Gerizim area. If it was “Gezrites” originally, the people could have migrated from Gezer. They are otherwise unmentioned in the OT.</p>",
