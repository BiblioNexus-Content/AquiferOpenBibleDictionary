The Greek word from which the English title “bishop” and the adjective “episcopal” are derived is often translated in modern versions as “elder,” “overseer” (as in the Berean Standard Bible), “shepherd,” or “guardian.” It corresponds closely to the current term “pastor.” Jesus is called “the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:25\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:25</a>, King James Version). </p><p>In the New Testament, “bishop,” and “elder” refer to the same office, as shown by the apostle Paul’s telling Titus to appoint “elders in every town” and then referring to those same individuals as “bishops” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:5,Titus1:7\">Titus 1:5, 7</a>). While at Miletus, Paul summoned the elders from the church at Ephesus and then addressed them as “overseers” or “guardians” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:17,Acts20:28\">Acts 20:17, 28</a>). In his letter to Philippi, Paul greeted the “bishops and deacons” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:1\">Philippians 1:1</a>). The fact that there were numerous bishops at Philippi, as well as in Ephesus, shows that the office of bishop had not yet developed into what it later became: a single bishop governing one or more churches.</p><p>Bishops obviously had positions of authority, but the duties of the office are not clearly defined in the New Testament. One task was to &quot;refute those who contradict [sound teaching]&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:9\">Titus 1:9</a>) and to teach and expound the Scriptures (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:2\">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:2</a>). In addition, there is some evidence that one of their primary concerns was economic matters and caring for the poor, as well as generally overseeing the congregation. The lists of qualifications in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus indicate that a bishop was considered a leader in the congregation and a representative to the non-Christian world. <br><br><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4143\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Elder</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6771\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pastor</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6978\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Presbyter</span>.</p>",
