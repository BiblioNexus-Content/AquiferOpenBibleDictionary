    "content": "<h1>HALLELUJAH</h1><p>An important Christian phrase frequently used in the early church’s worship and liturgy. </p><p>“Hallelujah” is a Hebrew word meaning &quot;Praise the Lord.&quot; The Hebrew word was transliterated (spelled out) using Greek letters and then English letters. It is used as a call to praise. Jewish people from before Christ were already using the term in the synagogue. “Hallelujah,” according to tradition, was written as one word, except in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps135:3\">Psalm 135:3</a>. In the Old Testament, it is only found in the Psalms, where it occurs 23 times, and for the first time in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:35\">Psalm 104:35</a>. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps111:1-Ps111:10\">Psalms 111</a> to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps113:9\">113</a> begin with “Hallelujah”; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps115:18\">Psalms 115</a> to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps117:1-Ps117:2\">117</a> end with &quot;Hallelujah&quot;; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps146:1-Ps146:10\">Psalms 146</a> to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps150:1-Ps150:6\">150</a> begin and end with it.</p><p>In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) version of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 113–118</a>, all the psalms are titled “Allelujah.” The church adopted the form &quot;Hallelujah&quot; from the Vulgate (the Latin translation of the Bible). “Amen” and “Hallelujah,” two Hebrew words that have been adopted into liturgical use, have passed from the Old Testament to the New Testament and finally to the church. But in some translations, the term is translated “Praise ye the Lord” (in the King James Version and Easy-to-Read Version) or “Praise the Lord“ (in the Revised Standard Version and the New Living Translation).</p><p>In Jewish worship, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 113–118, </a>called the Hallel or Hymn of Praise, is sung at the feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. During Passover, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps113:9\">Psalms 113</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps114:1-Ps114:8\">114</a> are sung at home before the meal, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 115–118</a> are sung after it. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:30\">Matthew 26:30</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:26\">Mark 14:26</a> call <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 115–118</a> the “hymn” when it is sung by Jesus and his disciples at the Last Supper.</p><p>“Hallelujah” only appears in the New Testament in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:1-Rev19:6\">Revelation 19:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:1-Rev19:6\">6</a>. It is sung by the saints in heaven. Early on, it was adopted into the church&apos;s liturgy. It became the most common expression of joy, so it was sung at Easter, as Augustine mentions. The church chose <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps113:9\">Psalms 113</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps114:1-Ps114:8\">114</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps118:1-Ps118:29\">118</a> from the Hebrew Hallel to be sung on Easter day, connecting Easter with Passover.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4779\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hallel</span>.</p>",
