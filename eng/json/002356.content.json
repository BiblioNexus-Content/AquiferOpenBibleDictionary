    "content": "<h1>HALLEL</h1><p>A Hebrew word describing a song of praise to God. Later, in the Talmud (J<span>ewish religious law) </span>and the writings of the rabbis (or teachers), it referred to groups of psalms of praise to God. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 113–118</a> were called the Egyptian Hallel, and early Jewish tradition believed Moses wrote them. </p><p>During the temple period, this Hallel was read 18 days of the year, but on one night, the Passover. It was read in parts during the Passover:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps114:8\">Psalms 113–114</a> were read before the meal, before drinking the second cup.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29\">Psalms 115–118</a> were read after the last cup was filled. </p></li></ul><p>This is probably the song that Jesus and his disciples sang at the Last Supper (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:30\">Matthew 26:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:26\">Mark 14:26</a>). This Hallel was also used for the feasts of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Tabernacles, and Dedication.</p><p>The Great Hallel was <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26\">Psalm 136</a> and sometimes <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps120:1-Ps136:26\">Psalms 120–136</a>. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps146:1-Ps148:14\">Psalms 146–148</a> were also a single Hallel. These were used during daily morning service of the synagogue.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4778\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hallelujah</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7892\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Talmud</span>.</p>",
