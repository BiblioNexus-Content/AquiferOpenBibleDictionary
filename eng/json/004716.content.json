    "content": "<h1>REGENERATION</h1><p>Spiritual rebirth that produces a new beginning. It describes the new life of the believer in Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus3:5\">Titus 3:5</a>) and the new order that will begin at Christ’s return (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:28\">Matthew 19:28</a>). It occurs in the King James Version of the Bible in only these two places. This does not mean, however, that the concept is unimportant. A variety of other words and figures are used frequently by the biblical writers to describe the same inner renewal of the heart.</p><p>Nonreligious writers also speak of regeneration. For the Stoic philosophers, regeneration meant a return to a former state of existence. They referred to the yearly cycle of the seasons as a regeneration. For the biblical writers, however, regeneration means a more significant renewal. It is a radically new beginning rather than a mere restoration of previous conditions. This renewal involves a mighty change in the person. It is a work of the Holy Spirit, breaking the power of sin and implanting proper attitudes and desires. The regenerated person freely and joyously does the will of God. </p><p>The ultimate goal of regeneration is the creation of a new heaven and earth that will be totally righteous and without sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:13</a>). The present working of the Holy Spirit in the believer is a foretaste of this future cosmic regeneration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14\">Ephesians 1:13–14</a>). The new heavens and earth are still future. But God’s renewal of his people, foreseen by the Old Testament prophets, is already a reality (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:17\">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:22\">66:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1\">Revelation 21:1</a>).</p><p>The believer now possesses a new life from God through the process of spiritual birth. Christians are born of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:12-John1:13\">John 1:12–13</a>). And it is only through this spiritual birth that one may participate in the kingdom of God and receive his Spirit. Those born into God’s family reflect his righteous character (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:29\">1&nbsp;John 2:29</a>). They are freed from habitual sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:9\">3:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John5:18\">5:18</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:18\">James 1:18</a>, this process of new birth is attributed to the power of the Word of God.</p><p>Extending this metaphor for regeneration, Jesus taught Nicodemus about the absolute necessity of being born again, or born from above, as a prerequisite to entering the kingdom of God. Those who are thus reborn possess a living hope (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3\">1&nbsp;Peter 1:3</a>). Again, this new birth is brought about through the power of the word of God (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:23\">23</a>).</p><p>The initial experience of regeneration is followed by a continuing renewal in the life of the Christian. The newborn are to desire the pure milk of the word of God in order to grow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:2\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:2</a>). Paul commands an ongoing transformation by the renewing of the mind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:2\">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:23\">Ephesians 4:23</a>). The new person remains in a process of constant renewal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:10\">Colossians 3:10</a>), and the inner self is renewed daily (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:16\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:16</a>).</p><p>The present result of the new birth is a new person or new creation for whom old things are replaced by new (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17</a>). It is this new creation, rather than superficial participation in religious practices, that is the goal of the Christian life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:15\">Galatians 6:15</a>). It involves laying aside the old nature (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:22\">Ephesians 4:22</a>) and putting on the new nature (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:24\">24</a>). In the final analysis, however, this is never the result of human effort alone. We are God’s workmanship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:10\">2:10</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3035\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Atonement</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3809\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Conversion</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7137\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Redeemer, Redemption</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7166\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Repentance</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7287\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Salvation</span>.</p>",
