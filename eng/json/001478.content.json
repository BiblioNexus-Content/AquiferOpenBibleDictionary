    "content": "<h1>CYRENE, CYRENIANS</h1><p>A city on the coast of North Africa, known as the capital of Cyrenaica. It was founded in the seventh century BC by Greeks who were mainly farmers. Herodotus, a historian from the fifth century BC, noted that Cyrene was unique because it had three harvest seasons, resulting in a long, continuous autumn of eight months: “the land of Cyrene, the highest of that part of Libya which is inhabited by Nomads, has the remarkable peculiarity of three separate harvest-seasons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. making for the fortunate people of Cyrene, a continuous autumn of eight months on end” (4.199).</p><p>Alexander the Great conquered Cyrene in 331 BC, and it later became part of the Roman Empire. During the New Testament period, the city had a large Jewish population from Alexandria. One of these Jews, Simon of Cyrene, was in Jerusalem during the Passover when he was compelled to carry Jesus&apos;s cross (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:32\">Matthew 27:32</a>). On Pentecost, Peter preached to Jews from Cyrene in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:10\">Acts 2:10</a>). Stephen was attacked by Jews from a synagogue that included people from Cyrene (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:9\">Acts 6:9</a>). Some of these Cyrenian Jews were later converted to Christianity and became preachers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:20\">Acts 11:20</a>), traveling as far as Antioch, where Lucius of Cyrene was a notable Christian teacher (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:1\">Acts 13:1</a>).</p>",
