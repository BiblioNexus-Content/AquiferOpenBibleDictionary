    "content": "<h1>SPIRIT</h1><p>Designation of that aspect of existence that is noncorporeal and immaterial. Its Latin derivation (as with the Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible—ruach and pneuma) denotes blowing or breathing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job41:16\">Jb 41:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa25:4\">Is 25:4</a>). So the noun <em>spiritus</em> signifies breath and life. God, the source of all life, is himself Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:24\">Jn 4:24</a>). He put a spirit within all human beings so that they could commune with him in his realm and in his nature. A Christian’s experience of Jesus Christ is made real when that person experiences the Spirit of Jesus Christ in his or her spirit.</p><p>Three articles follow that describe three major aspects of spirit: (1)&nbsp;Spirit of God; (2)&nbsp;Spirit of Jesus Christ; (3)&nbsp;spirit of man.</p>",
