    "content": "<h1>MENORAH</h1><p>A lamp or lampstand that was used in the tabernacle (the holy tent where God was worshiped). It was a special seven-branched lamp that provided light in the tabernacle. These seven lamps lit up the area in front of the lampstand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num8:2\">Numbers 8:2</a>). King Solomon’s temple had ten of these lampstands, with five on each side of the inner sanctuary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:49\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:49</a>). </p><p>Bezalel designed the original menorah. He was the son of Uri and grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah. God filled him with his Spirit and gave him excellent crafting skills (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod31:1-Exod31:4\">Exodus 31:1–4</a>). Bezalel also designed other items used in the tabernacle.</p><p>The Bible gives details about how the menorah looked in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:31-Exod25:40\">Exodus 25:31–40</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod37:17-Exod37:24\">37:17–24</a>. It was made from a single piece of pure gold. The menorah had a central shaft with three branches extending from each side. Each branch was decorated with almond flowers and apple-shaped knobs. At the top of each branch was a cup narrowed at the lip to hold the wick and special olive oil.</p><p>Archaeologists have found clay bowls with seven spouts from the Middle Bronze Age (around 2000 to 1550 BC). The Jewish historian Josephus said the central shaft was attached to a base. From this shaft came slender branches that looked like the prongs of a trident, with each end shaped into a lamp. This description matches what Zechariah saw in his vision of the restored temple after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech4:2-Zech4:3\">Zechariah 4:2–3</a>). </p><p>Several copies of the menorah have been found by archaeologists. One famous image of the menorah appears on the Arch of Titus in Rome. This sculpture shows the menorah and other temple items. However, the menorah on the Arch of Titus looks different from Josephus&apos;s description. It is very large with thick arms. It is carried by five men on each side.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod37:24\">Exodus 37:24</a>, the menorah weighed one kikar of pure gold. This equals about 34 kilograms (or 75 pounds). But <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:39\">Exodus 25:39 </a>suggests this weight included accessories like snuffers and trays (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:22\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:22</a>). </p><p>There is disagreement about what the base of the menorah looked like. On the Arch of Titus, the base is rectangular with two levels. But archaeologists found ancient designs of the lamp that end in a tripod (a three-legged stand). Scholars are unsure which design is more original, and they have different theories to explain these differences.</p><p>In Jewish mystical teachings, the menorah symbolizes the tree of life, the seven planets, and the seven days of creation.</p><p>In the New Testament, the lampstand in Revelation continues the temple tradition, with special reference to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech4:2,Zech4:11\">Zechariah 4:2, 11</a>. It represents the witness of the seven churches, Christ who is the Light of the World, and God who is the source of all light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:12-Rev1:13,Rev1:20\">Revelation 1:12–13, 20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:1\">2:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev11:4\">11:4</a>).</p>",
