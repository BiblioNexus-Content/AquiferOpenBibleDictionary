Dishanâ€™s father was Seir the Horite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:21\">Gn 36:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:38</a>). The Horites were driven out of their territory by the Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:12\">Dt 2:12</a>). Later OT references often use Seir and Edom synonymously.</p>",
