    "content": "<h1>TIRZAH (Place)</h1><p>Tirzah was the early capital city of the divided kingdom of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:17\">1&nbsp;Kings 14:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:21,1Kgs15:33\">15:21, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:6-1Kgs16:23\">16:6–23</a>). It was one of the cities captured by Joshua during Israel&apos;s conquest of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:24\">Joshua 12:24</a>). </p><p>Tirzah became an important city when King Jeroboam made it his home (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:17\">1&nbsp;Kings 14:17</a>). Baasha planned to move his capital to Ramah but his war against Asa forced him to return to Tirzah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:21\">1&nbsp;Kings 15:21</a>). Tirzah also served as the capital city for the kings Elah, Zimri, and Omri during the first six years of Omri’s reign. But when Omri built a new capital called Samaria, Tirzah became less important.</p><p>In 753 BC, King Menahem used Tirzah to revolt against King Shallum (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:14\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:14</a>). This might have been because of the rivalry between the cities of Tirzah and Samaria.</p><p>The city was known for being beautiful (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:4\">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>). It was built on a high hill, which would have given people a great view of the surrounding area. However, today we do not know exactly where the city was located.</p>",
