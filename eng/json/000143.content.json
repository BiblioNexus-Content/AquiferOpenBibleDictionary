    "content": "<h1>ADULLAM, ADULLAMITE</h1><p>An old Canaanite city between Lachish and Hebron. It also is the name of a cave region nearby. </p><p>The first reference to the city in the Bible is in the word &quot;Adullamite&quot; (someone from Adullam). It is used to describe Hirah, a friend of Judah. After Judah helped sell his brother Joseph into slavery, Judah left home and lived in Adullam with Hirah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:1,Gen38:12,Gen38:20\">Genesis 38:1, 12, 20</a>).</p><p>Adullam was in the lowlands of Judah&apos;s tribal area (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:35\">Joshua 15:35</a>). Joshua conquered it, along with 31&nbsp;other Canaanite royal cities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:15\">Joshua 12:15</a>). King Rehoboam strengthened it along with 15 other cities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:7\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:7</a>). After the exiles&apos; return from captivity in Babylon, people from Judah lived in Adullam again (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:30\">Nehemiah 11:30</a>).</p><p>A cave near Adullam was important several times in David&apos;s life. He hid in it when he fled from King Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:1</a>). He also used it as a base in his war against the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:13-2Sam23:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:13</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:13-2Sam23:17\">17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:15-1Chr11:19\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:15</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:15-1Chr11:19\">19</a>). David wrote <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps57:1-Ps57:11\">Psalms 57</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps142:1-Ps142:7\">142</a> when he was in the cave of Adullam. Adullam is the modern-day Tell esh-Sheikh Madhkur.</p>",
