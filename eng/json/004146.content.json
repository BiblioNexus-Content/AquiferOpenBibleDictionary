    "content": "<h1>NIMRIM, Waters of</h1><p>One of the places in the southern extremity of Moab denounced by Isaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:6\">Is 15:6</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:34\">Jer 48:34</a>) in their oracles of judgment against the nation. The waters of Nimrim were spring-fed streams originating in the Transjordanian hills, following a northwesterly track down into the Arabah Valley, and eventually emptying into the southeast corner of the Dead Sea. The region surrounding the streams was evidently well known for its lush vegetation (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:6\">Is 15:6</a>). This watercourse is probably identifiable with the modern Wadi en-Numeirah positioned about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) north of the Brook Zered.</p>",
