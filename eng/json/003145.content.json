    "content": "<h1>JOGBEHAH</h1><p>Jogbehah was a city located in Gilead (the area east of the Jordan River). The tribe of Gad built and fortified this city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:35\">Numbers 32:35</a>). During the time of the judges, when Gideon was chasing the Midianites, he traveled around to the east of Jogbehah. This allowed him to attack the Midianite camp at Karkor when they were not expecting it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:11\">Judges 8:11</a>). </p><p>Scholars now identify this ancient city with Khirbet el-Ajbeihat, which is 11.3&nbsp;kilometers (seven miles) northwest of Amman.</p>",
