This ascent was the route used by the Ammonites and the Moabites prior to their defeat by Jehoshaphat as prophesied by Jehaziel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:16\">2&nbsp;Chr 20:16</a>). It is likely that Ziz should be identified with Ain Jidy, a pass that still provides an important route from the Dead Sea into the Judean interior.</p>",
