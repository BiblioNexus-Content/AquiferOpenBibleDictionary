    "content": "<h1>FAITHFULNESS</h1><p>Faithfulness means staying loyal and true to someone or something. It shows itself through strong dedication and keeping promises. In the Bible&apos;s original Hebrew language, the words for &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;faithfulness&quot; are closely connected.</p><p>The main Hebrew word for faithfulness is related to our word &quot;amen.&quot; This word means &quot;to make strong,&quot; &quot;support,&quot; or &quot;hold up.&quot; In a physical sense, it is used of pillars that provide support for doors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:16\">2&nbsp;Kings 18:16</a>). Moses used this word when he said he could not support all the Israelite people by himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:12\">Numbers 11:12</a>). God, however, is a firm support for his people forever (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:9\">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa49:7\">Isaiah 49:7</a>).</p><p>Words like &quot;firmness,&quot; &quot;constancy,&quot; or &quot;trustworthiness&quot; best describe the concept of faithfulness. Trustworthiness or steadfastness are characteristics of the person one trusts. To be unfaithful is to&nbsp;be unworthy of confidence or belief. In the Old Testament, &quot;faithfulness&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; are close in meaning. God is consistently true, so he is the logical object of human trust (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps71:22\">Psalms 71:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:8\">Isaiah 61:8</a>). When applied to God, &quot;faithfulness&quot; indicates his unwavering commitment to his promises.</p><h2>God’s Faithfulness</h2><p>Despite Israel’s faithlessness, God showed himself reliable (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:20\">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:3\">Romans 3:3</a>). His faithfulness is great (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam3:23\">Lamentations 3:23</a>). He is loyal to his covenant (special agreement) and will always show his constant love to his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26\">Psalms 136</a>).</p><p>Jesus Christ shows the greatest example of faithfulness in the Bible. He proved himself faithful to God the Father and in telling the truth about God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:2\">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev1:5\">Revelation 1:5</a>). God calls all people to be faithful by following Jesus Christ and depending on him for all things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:4\">Habakkuk 2:4</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:17\">Romans 1:17</a>).</p><h2>Human Faithfulness</h2><p>In both the Old and New Testaments, faith and faithfulness go together. Having faith means more than just agreeing that God tells the truth. It means committing to that truth and showing it through continued obedience.</p><p>Abraham&apos;s life shows us what faithfulness looks like. He believed God&apos;s words and acted on them. He showed his faith by:</p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Leaving his home and country</p></li><li><p>Living in a foreign land</p></li><li><p>Being willing to offer his only son Isaac as God commanded</p></li></ul><p>Abraham&apos;s willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac shows extraordinary faithfulness to God. The New Testament praises Abraham&apos;s steady faith and tells Christians to follow his example (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:6-Gal3:9\">Galatians 3:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:8-Heb11:10\">Hebrews 11:8–10</a>). Faithfulness is not just a single action. It should shape the whole life of everyone who says they have faith in God.</p>",
