    "content": "<h1>AZEKAH</h1><p>A town in the agricultural plain known as the Shephelah. It existed at least as early as the conquest of&nbsp;Canaan (the Promised Land), since Joshua drove the alliance of Amorite kings to Azekah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:10,Josh10:22\">Joshua 10:10, 22</a>). It is also mentioned in the story of the encounter of David and Goliath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:1</a>). Archaeological digs have shown that Azekah was heavily defended with a system of underground refuge chambers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:9,2Chr11:11\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:9, 11</a>). Azekah, Lachish, and Jerusalem are mentioned as the only remaining walled cities of the southern kingdom of Judah at the time of Nebuchadnezzarâ€™s attack on Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer34:7\">Jeremiah 34:7</a>). Some returnees from the exile in Babylon moved into Azekah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:30\">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). Today it is known as Tell Zakariyeh.</p>",
