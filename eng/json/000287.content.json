This person would go on short trips to share messages or make agreements. They acted as the official voice of the leader who sent them. Examples include:</p><ul><li><p>the envoys of Pharaoh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa30:4\">Isaiah 30:4</a>), </p></li><li><p>the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr32:31\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:31</a>), and </p></li><li><p>messengers of Neco, king of Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr35:21\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 35:21</a>). </p></li></ul><p>In the letters of Paul, the apostle called himself an ambassador for Christ because he had an apostolic mission to share the gospel of Christ with the gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:20\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:20\">Ephesians 6:20</a>).</p>",
