This offering was for the Jewish Christians who were suffering from the effects of a famine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">Acts 20:4</a>). Sopater may be the same person as Sosipater, the relative of Paul who sent greetings to the church at Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:21\">Romans 16:21</a>).</p>",
