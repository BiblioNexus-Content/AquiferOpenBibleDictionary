    "content": "<h1>GILEAD (Place)</h1><ol><li><p>A region east of the Jordan River. It often referred to the land where the Israelite tribes lived on that side of the river (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:1\">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:33\">2&nbsp;Kings 10:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer50:19\">Jeremiah 50:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech10:10\">Zechariah 10:10</a>). More exactly, it was the area between the Yarmuk River in the north and the Arnon River in the south. The Jabbok River ran through the middle of it.</p><p>Some people call the highlands of Gilead the “Dome of Gilead.” This area is part of the hill country that stretches north from Judah. It rises over 914 meters (3,000 feet) above the Jordan Valley. Many rivers and streams flow through Gilead. Because of this, the flat land was good for farming. People grew olive trees, grapevines, and grain there (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer8:22\">Jeremiah 8:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer46:11\">46:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos2:8\">Hosea 2:8</a>). The hills of Gilead were steep and covered with trees. Some writers compared them to the forests of Lebanon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer22:6\">Jeremiah 22:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech10:10\">Zechariah 10:10</a>). These hills gave safety to people running away from danger. The rough land made it hard for enemies to follow them (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:21\">Genesis 31:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam13:7\">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:7</a>).</p><p>At first, God gave the region of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:42\">Numbers 32</a>). </p><p>During the time of the judges, the Midianites and Amalekites attacked Gilead. But Gideon led the Israelites to victory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:1-Judg7:25\">Judges 6–7</a>). About 50 years later, the people asked Jephthah to return from exile and help them. He saved Gilead from the Ammonites (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:1-Judg11:40\">10–11</a>). </p><p>During the time of King Saul, he saved Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:11\">1&nbsp;Samuel 11:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam31:8-1Sam31:13\">31:8–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam2:1-2Sam2:7\">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:1–7</a>). Later, Saul’s commander Abner made Ish-bosheth king in Gilead to oppose David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9\">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:8–9</a>). David defeated the Ammonites and took control of Gilead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:11-2Sam8:12\">8:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:19\">10:1–19</a>). When Absalom rebelled, he fled to Gilead for refuge (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam17:29\">15–17</a>). After Absalom died in the forest of Ephraim, David returned to Jerusalem as king (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam19:43\">18–19</a>). </p><p>Later, during the divided kingdom, Gilead became a place of war. First, the Israelites fought against the Syrians (also called Arameans) (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:23-1Kgs20:43\">1&nbsp;Kings 20:23–43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:4,1Kgs22:29-1Kgs22:40\">22:1–4, 29–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:22\">2&nbsp;Kings 13:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:3\">Amos 1:3</a>). Then the Assyrians invaded. In 733 BC, they took Gilead from King Pekah and sent the people into exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:27-2Kgs15:31\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:27–31</a>). This ended Gilead’s connection with the northern kingdom of Israel.</p></li><li><p>A city known for doing evil things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos6:8\">Hosea 6:8</a>). This city may have been a shorter name for Jabesh-gilead or Ramoth-gilead. It may also be the same place as the Mizpah mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:17-Judg10:18\">Judges 10:17–18</a>.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6345\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mizpah #5</span>.</p></li></ol>",
