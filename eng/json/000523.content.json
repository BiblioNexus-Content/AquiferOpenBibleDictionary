    "content": "<h1>ASHAN</h1><p>A town in the southwestern Judean foothills slightly northwest of Beersheba. </p><p>Ashan was originally in the tribe of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:42\">Joshua 15:42</a>). Then it became Simeonâ€™s (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:7\">Joshua 19:7</a>). Finally, it was given to the Levites as a city of refuge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:59\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:59</a>). David traveled in that area with his group of men who were not following the law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:30\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:30</a>). The city of Ain mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:16\">Joshua 21:16 </a>probably refers to Ashan (this is different than the Ain in the northeast of Canaan, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:11\">Numbers 34:11</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3738\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of Refuge</span>.</p>",
