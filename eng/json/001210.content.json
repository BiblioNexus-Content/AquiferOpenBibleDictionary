He was one of three civil officers (magistrates) of Bethulia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt6:14-Jdt6:15\">Judith 6:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt10:6\">10:6</a>). When the Assyrians attacked the town, Chabris and the other leaders said they would only wait a few more days for God to save them. If nothing happened, they planned to surrender.</p><p>Judith rebuked them for this. She told them not to test God or give him a time limit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt8:9-Jdt8:27\">Judith 8:9–27</a>).</p>",
