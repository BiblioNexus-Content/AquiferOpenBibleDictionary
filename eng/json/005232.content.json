Jesus compared those killed by the fallen tower to the rest of the people living in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:4-Luke13:5\">Luke 13:4</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:4-Luke13:5\">5</a>). </p><p>Nothing is known of this tower other than it was probably in Jerusalem. It might be the great tower built by Nehemiah on the wall of Ophel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:26-Neh3:27\">Nehemiah 3:26</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:26-Neh3:27\">27</a>).
