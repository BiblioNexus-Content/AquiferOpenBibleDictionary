    "content": "<h1>NER</h1><p>A man from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the father of Abner and brother of Kish. This would make Ner the uncle of King Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51\">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:5\">26:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8\">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:32\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:28\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:28</a>). </p><p>However, the Bible gives different information about Ner&apos;s family relationships. In one passage, the Bible says that Ner&apos;s father was named Abiel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51\">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:51</a>). But other passages list Ner as one of the sons of Jeiel, though these readings are difficult to interpret (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:29-1Chr8:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:29–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35-1Chr9:36\">9:35–36</a>). In other parts of the Bible, Ner is listed as the father of Kish, who was the father of Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:33\">8:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:39\">9:39</a>). This would make Ner the grandfather of Saul.</p><p>One possible explanation is that there were two different men named Kish. One Kish was Ner&apos;s brother, and the other was Ner&apos;s son. Another explanation is that there were two different men named Ner. </p><p>These different explanations show that family lists in the Bile are sometimes incomplete or unclear.</p>",
