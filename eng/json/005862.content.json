On this day, the high priest performed special ceremonies to ask God to forgive the sins of the people. It was a day for the Israelites to stop working, fast, and show sorrow for their sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:26-Lev23:32\">Leviticus 23:26–32</a>). </p><p>The name <em>Yom Kippur</em> means “Day of Atonement” in Hebrew. It comes from words that mean “day” (<em>yom</em>) and “to make atonement” (<em>kippur</em>). It was the only day each year when the high priest could enter the most holy place in the tabernacle.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Feasts and Festivals of Israel</span>.</p>",
