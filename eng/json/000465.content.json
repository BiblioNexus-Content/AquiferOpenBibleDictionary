The early church father Jerome thought the name Argob (along with Arieh) referred to a place. Today, some scholars think that Argob and Arieh may have been accidentally misplaced from a&nbsp;list of place names (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</a>) through transcription error.</p>",
