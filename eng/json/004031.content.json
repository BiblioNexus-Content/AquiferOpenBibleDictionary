    "content": "<h1>NAHASH</h1><ol><li><p>A king of the Ammonites. He attacked the town of Jabesh-gilead during the time when Saul was king of Israel. The people of the town asked to make a peace treaty. Nahash agreed, but only if he could gouge out the right eye of every man. He wanted to shame all of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam11:1-1Sam11:2\">1&nbsp;Samuel 11:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam12:12\">12:12</a>). The people of Jabesh asked for seven days to find help. During that time, they sent a message to Saul. Saul gathered Israel’s army and rescued the town. His army defeated the Ammonites.</p><p>Later, Nahash showed kindness to David. But when Nahash died, his son Hanun became king. Hanun listened to bad advice and insulted David’s messengers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:2\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:1-1Chr19:2\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:1–2</a>).</p></li><li><p>The father of Abigail and Zeruiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:25\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:25</a>). These women were also called the daughters of Jesse and the sisters of David and his brothers in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:16</a>. To explain the difference, some think Nahash’s wife married Jesse after Nahash died. She then gave birth to David with her second husband, Jesse.</p></li><li><p>The father of Shobi from Rabbah. Shobi was from Rabbah, the main city of the Ammonites. He helped David when David ran away from Absalom. Shobi brought supplies to David and his men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:27</a>). This Nahash might be the same person as #1 above.</p></li></ol>",
