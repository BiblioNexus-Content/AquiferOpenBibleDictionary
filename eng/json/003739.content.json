    "content": "<h1><strong>MEANING OF NAMES IN THE BIBLE</strong></h1><p>In Bible times, people gave names to show something about a person. A name could also express something through that person. Names were not just convenient labels.</p><p>People chose names for at least seven main reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>To record something about a person’s birth</strong></p><p>Sometimes a name told about how a person was born. For example, Moses’s adoptive mother named him because she drew him out of the water. The sound of his name was like a Hebrew word that means &quot;to draw out&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:10\">Exodus 2:10</a>). <br><br>Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:26\">Genesis 25:26</a>) and Samuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:20\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:20</a>) also got their names from the events at their births. Samuel’s name means “heard by God.” It does not point to the prayer itself but to God hearing and answering it.</p><p>These names sometimes showed more than birth events. They could also point to the person’s future. Jacob later became known for taking advantage of others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:36\">Genesis 27:36</a>). Samuel became known as a man of prayer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam7:5-1Sam7:9\">1&nbsp;Samuel 7:5–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam8:6\">8:6, 21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam12:19-1Sam12:23\">12:19–23</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>To show a parent’s feelings at the birth</strong></p><p>Sometimes parents chose a name to show how they felt when the child was born. Isaac’s name means “laughter” (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:17\">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:12\">18:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:3-Gen21:6\">21:3–6</a>). Nabal’s name means “fool” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:25\">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:25</a>). His mother may have hoped he would not be foolish, but sadly he was.<br><br>Abimelech’s name means “my father is king” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:31\">Judges 8:31</a>). This might have shown a hidden desire of his father Gideon, even though Gideon said publicly he would not be king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:22-Judg8:23\">Judges 8:22–23</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>To keep family unity</strong></p><p>Sometimes a name was chosen to keep the family closely connected. This may be why people wanted to name the baby Zechariah in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:59\">Luke 1:59</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>To show the person’s nature, role, or something important about them</strong></p><p>A name could tell what a person would do or what they were like. The best example is Jesus, whose name was given because he would save his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:21\">Matthew 1:21</a>). </p><p>The prophet Isaiah’s name means “the Lord saves.” Isaiah seems to have seen this as part of his message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:18\">Isaiah 8:18</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>To share God’s message</strong></p><p>Sometimes God told a prophet to give a child a special name to show His message. For example, Isaiah named his first son Shear-jashub, which means “a remnant shall return” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:3\">Isaiah 7:3</a>). This name had two parts to the message: because the people were unfaithful, only a small group would come back; but because God is faithful, that group would survive.</p><p>Isaiah named his second son Maher-shalal-hash-baz, which means “speed-prey-haste-spoil” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:3\">Isaiah 8:3</a>). This showed that an enemy would soon attack and win quickly.</p></li><li><p><strong>To show religious belief</strong></p><p>Some names in the Bible include endings like <em>-iah</em> (or <em>-jah</em>) or <em>-el</em>. These endings mean “the Lord” (<em>-yah</em>) or “God” (<em>-el</em>). For example, Adonijah means “the Lord is sovereign” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:4\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:4</a>). Nathanael means “God gave” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:47\">John 1:47</a>).</p><p>Parents often chose these kinds of names during times when many people turned away from God. The names showed the parents’ faith.</p></li><li><p><strong>7. To show authority over someone</strong></p><p>In the ancient Near East, giving a name showed power or authority over the person or thing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:19-Gen2:20\">Genesis 2:19–20</a>). If a person did not know another’s name, they could not do harm or good to them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:12\">Exodus 33:12, 17</a>).</p><p>In ancient times, a name often described the person or their work. If the person or situation changed, the name could change too. For example, Abram became Abraham, and Jacob became Israel.</p><p>A ruler could also change someone’s name to show control. Pharaoh changed Joseph’s name to Zaphenath-paneah when Joseph became a leader in Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen41:45\">Genesis 41:45</a>). Pharaoh Neco changed King Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim when he ruled Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:34\">2&nbsp;Kings 23:34</a>). In Babylon, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were given new names (Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego) by order of the king’s official (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan1:6-Dan1:7\">Daniel 1:6–7</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament, an angel sent by God told what John the Baptist’s name would be. In the same way, an angel told the name of Jesus. These names showed God’s authority over John and His special relationship as Father to Jesus.</p></li></ol><h2>New Names</h2><p>In the Bible, a name could show a person’s nature or position. This is clear in the practice of giving someone a new name. For example, God changed Sarai’s name to Sarah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:15\">Genesis 17:15</a>). Three motivations are possible:</p><ol><li><p><strong>To show the gift of new power or role</strong></p><p>A new name could replace the old one to show that the person received new power or ability. This could be like a new beginning. For example, the childless Abram became Abraham, which means “father of a multitude of nations” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:5\">Genesis 17:5</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>To show a new character and standing with God</strong></p><p>A new name could show that a person’s character or position with God had changed. For example, Jacob the trickster became Israel the man of power with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen32:27\">Genesis 32:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos12:3-Hos12:4\">Hosea 12:3–4</a>). In the New Testament, Simon became Peter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:42\">John 1:42</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>To fix a new loyalty in place of the old</strong></p><p>A new name could be given to make someone loyal to a new ruler or religion. For example, Daniel, who was taken captive to Babylon, was given the name Belteshazzar. This name included the name Bel, a Babylonian god. It was likely meant to turn Daniel’s loyalty from the God of his ancestors to the gods of his captors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan1:7\">Daniel 1:7</a>).</p></li></ol><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4667\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">God, Names of</span>.</p>",
