None of the animal was eaten. It was entirely consumed by fire. The Israelites offered burnt offerings to seek forgiveness for sin and to restore their relationship with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev1:17\">Leviticus 1</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6630\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Offerings and Sacrifices</span>.</p>",
