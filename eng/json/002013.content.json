    "content": "<h1>FIRSTFRUITS</h1><p>A firstborn child, animal, or the first parts of any crop. They were considered holy in Hebrew thought and belonged to God. The firstfruits were a way to thank God for his goodness by offering the first part, a sign of more to come.</p><h2>Firstfruits in the Old Testament</h2><p>Firstfruit offerings could be crops or products like dough, bread, wine, olive oil, or wool. The firstborn son and the firstborn animals also belonged to God. For children and unclean animals, the firstborn had to be &quot;redeemed.&quot; This meant they were paid for with money. Firstborn cows, sheep, and goats were sacrificed to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:14-Num18:17\">Numbers 18:14–17</a>).</p><p>The firstfruits were reserved for priests. The Bible mentions “the first of the firstfruits” at least three times. This could mean the first to ripen or the best of the harvest. These offerings were for the priests. Only the ritually clean could eat them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num18:12-Num18:13\">Numbers 18:12–13</a>). For other references to the firstfruits, see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod23:15-Exod23:19\">Exodus 23:15–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:22,Exod34:26\">34:22, 26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev2:14\">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:10-Lev23:17\">23:10–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num15:20-Num15:21\">Numbers 15:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num28:26-Num28:31\">28:26–31</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut26:1-Deut26:11\">Deuteronomy 26:1–11</a>.</p><p>To present the firstfruits, people brought their offerings to the priest at the tabernacle or, later, the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut26:2\">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>). The priest would take the offering and, on the first day of the week, wave it before the Lord with outstretched arms. On the same day, the person offered a male lamb, a grain offering of flour mixed with olive oil, and a wine offering. Fifty days later, a grain offering was made. Each family gave two loaves of bread to the Lord, along with animal, grain, and drink offerings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:9-Lev23:22\">Leviticus 23:9–22</a>).</p><h2>Firstfruits in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, Paul called Jesus&apos;s resurrection the firstfruits of the future resurrection of believers at his return (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20,1Cor15:23\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:20, 23</a>). The Holy Spirit, who lives in all believers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:9\">Romans 8:9</a>), is also called the firstfruits of full redemption to come. &quot;Firstfruits&quot; also referred to the first believers in a region (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:5\">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:15\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:15</a>). It symbolized a promise of a larger spiritual harvest.</p><p>Christian believers are firstfruits. They are God&apos;s unique, holy possession (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:18\">James 1:18</a>). In Revelation, the 144,000 are described as the firstfruits of God&apos;s people. They belong to both God and Jesus Christ, who is called the Lamb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:4\">Revelation 14:4</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Feasts and Festivals of Israel</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6630\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Offerings and Sacrifices</span>.</p>",
