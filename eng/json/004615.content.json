    "content": "<h1>QUADRATUS, Apology of</h1><p>Around AD 125 Quadratus wrote an early Christian defense (or apology) of Christianity to emperor Hadrian. The writings of Eusebius preserve the&nbsp;only surviving fragment of this apology. The fragment says the following:</p><p>“But the works of our Savior were always present (for&nbsp;they were genuine): namely, those who healed, those who rose from the dead; who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present; and not merely when the Savior was on earth, but after his departure as well, they lived for a considerable time; insomuch that some of&nbsp;them survived even to our own day.”</p><p>According to Eusebius, Quadratus wrote the apology to defend the church. Eusebius wrote, “Certain evil men tried to trouble those who belonged to us.” Quadratus also hoped to persuade Hadrian of the truthfulness of Christianity. If Quadratus could assure Hadrian of the pure&nbsp;intentions of the Christians, Hadrian might end the&nbsp;persecutions. The apology of Quadratus is sometimes mistakenly identified with the “Letter to Diognetus.”</p>",
