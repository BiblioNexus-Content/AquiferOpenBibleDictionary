The single biblical reference (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:3\">Acts 18:3</a>) is to Aquila and Priscilla of Corinth. They worked as tentmakers. The apostle Paul joined them because he had trained in the same craft. He made a regular living at this trade during his missionary journeys (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:7-2Cor11:10\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:7â€“10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess2:9\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:8\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:8</a>).</p>",
