    "content": "<h1>CONSUMPTION</h1><p>A medical term that in the past referred to tuberculosis of the lungs (an infection caused by bacteria). The word &quot;consumption&quot; appears twice in the Bible (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:16\">Leviticus 26:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:22\">Deuteronomy 28:22</a>, Revised Standard Version). However, it does not specifically mean tuberculosis. Instead, it refers to any long-lasting disease that causes the body to waste away. This could include cancer, diarrhea, poor nutrition, malaria, kidney failure, and other health problems. In the Bible, consumption is listed as one of many medical conditions that would affect those who do not follow God&apos;s commandments.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
