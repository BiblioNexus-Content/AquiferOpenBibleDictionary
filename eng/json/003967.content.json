The Israelites encamped near it on the last stage of their journey to the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:49\">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>). The mountain now identified as Nebo has two peaks. The Old Testament name of the peak of Nebo is &quot;Pisgah&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:1\">34:1</a>). From this high place, Moses saw the land God had promised to give to Israel (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:1-Deut34:5\">1â€“5</a>).</p>",
