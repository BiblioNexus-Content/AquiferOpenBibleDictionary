The capstone or keystone is the most important part of an arch and is the last stone put in place. This stone connects the two curving sides together and distributes the weight evenly through them to the foundation.</p><p>Arches were not used in ancient Israel and appear in the Bible only through mistranslation. A Hebrew word was translated “arches” throughout Ezekiel’s vision of the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek40:49\">Ezekiel 40</a>), but this word refers to porches rather than arches.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2888\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Architecture</span>.</p>",
