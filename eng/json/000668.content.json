During the celebration, Absalom got his revenge: he had Amnon killed.</p><p>Baal-hazor is not the Hazor in the tribal land of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:33\">Nehemiah 11:33</a>). It is also not the Hazor north of the Sea of Galilee in the tribal land of Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11\">Joshua 11:10</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11\">11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15\">1&nbsp;Kings 9:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</a>).
