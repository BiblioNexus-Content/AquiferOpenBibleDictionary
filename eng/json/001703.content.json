He was notable because he was left-handed (Hebrew “hindered in the right hand”). Before taking Israelite tribute to Eglon, he made an iron dagger, with which he assassinated the unsuspecting Eglon during a private audience. He then rallied the Israelites west of the Jordan to encircle the Moabite troops before they could return south to Moab. When the 18-year rule of Eglon over the Israelites ended, an 80-year period of peace began.</p><p>2. Bilhan’s son, a member of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:10\">1&nbsp;Chr 7:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:6\">8:6</a>).</p>",
