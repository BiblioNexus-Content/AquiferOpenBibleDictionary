According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:36\">John 3</a>, Nicodemus came to Jesus at night and acknowledged him as a teacher sent by God. He was convinced that Jesus could not perform such things if God were not with him. Following an exchange concerning the need to be born again, Jesus asked how Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish religious court, could fail to understand such things. At that time he evidently made no profession of faith, but later he did defend Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:50-John7:52\">7:50–52</a>). After Jesus’ death, Nicodemus openly assisted Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of his body (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:39-John19:42\">19:39–42</a>).</p><p>Some scholars suggest that Nicodemus was one of the Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus but did not confess him openly for fear of excommunication (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:42\">12:42</a>). Tradition subsequently held that he belonged to the household of faith, as one persuaded to believe through the message and deeds of Jesus, but remained intimidated by the religious establishment.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5576\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">John, Gospel of</span>.</p>",
