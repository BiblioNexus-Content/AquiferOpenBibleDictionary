    "content": "<h1>APPEAL</h1><p>A legal term for requesting a higher court to review a decision by a lower court. Old Testament law made no provision for appeals. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul appealed to Caesar for a hearing after his arrest in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts25:11\">Acts 25:11</a>). Because Paul was a Roman citizen, he could have his case removed from the Jewish courts. Paul feared an unfair trial in the Jewish courts. </p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3747\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Civil Law and Justice</span>.</p>",
