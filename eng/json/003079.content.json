The Greek and Syriac reading of “Jeshanah” as one of the towns between which Samuel erected the Ebenezer stone may be preferred to the Hebrew “Shen” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam7:12\">1&nbsp;Samuel 7:12</a>. Its location is perhaps near Burj el-Isaneh, four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Bethel.</p>",
