Joshua led the Israelites to defeat these five kings completely at the battle of Beth-horon. During this battle, God helped the Israelites by sending large hailstones and by making the sun stand still. Japhia and the four kings hid in a cave at Makkedah. But Joshua discovered them. He then had them killed and hung on trees (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:3-Josh10:27\">Joshua 10:3â€“27</a>).</p></li><li><p>A son born to David while he was king in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:15\">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:7\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr14:6\">14:6</a>).</p></li></ol>",
