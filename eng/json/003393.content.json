The exact location of Kub is unknown, and it is only mentioned once in the Bible. The name appears in the Hebrew text, but many Bible translations say “Libya” instead of Kub. This is because Kub may have been a region in North Africa.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5909\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Libya, Libyans</span>.</p>",
