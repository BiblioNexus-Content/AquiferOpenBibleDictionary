    "content": "<h1>PSALM 151</h1><p>A psalm that is accepted as Scripture by the Eastern Orthodox churches but not by Jews, Roman Catholics, or Protestants. <span>Psalm 151 was known only through ancient translations (Greek, Latin, and Syriac) until it was found in a manuscript&nbsp;at Qumran</span>. At Qumran, the psalm was included in the Hebrew Psalm Scroll (11Q). The Hebrew text includes two different poems. The first poem (called 151A) is a commentary on <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1-1Sam16:13\">1&nbsp;Samuel 16:1–13</a>. It relates how David watched his father’s flocks but was made king over God’s people because of his heart. The second poem (called 151B) is a commentary on <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</a> and discusses David and Goliath. Some think it shows the bravery of David rather than his humility as in 151A.</p>",
