Priest who served in the time of David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:12\">1&nbsp;Chr 9:12</a>).

KJV rendering of Hashabiah, another of Parosh’s sons, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:25\">Ezra 10:25</a>. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4860\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hashabiah #9</span>.</p><p>6. Harim’s son, who obeyed Ezra’s exhortation to divorce his pagan wife after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:31\">Ezr 10:31</a>, kjv “Malchiah”). He repaired part of the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:11\">Neh 3:11</a>).</p><p>7. Recab’s son and the ruler of Beth-hakkerem.

Royal prince who owned a cistern in which the prophet Jeremiah was imprisoned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:6\">Jer 38:6</a>). Malchijah’s son Pashhur (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer21:1\">21:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1\">38:1</a>) was one of those who, after hearing the harsh prophecies of Jeremiah, appealed to King Zedekiah to put Jeremiah to death. The princes attempted to do so by throwing him into Malchijah’s cistern.</p>",
