    "content": "<h1>PHICHOL, PHICOL</h1><p>The leader of Abimelech&apos;s army. He was present when Abimelech made peace agreements with Abraham and later with Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:22,Gen21:32\">Genesis 21:22, 32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:26\">26:26</a>). The presence of an army commander should have indicated that Abraham was vulnerable. But, the enemies acknowledged the superior power of the God of Abraham. So, they sought to live with him in peace.</p>",
