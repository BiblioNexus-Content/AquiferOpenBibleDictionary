Haggai’s name probably came from a word for “festival.” We have no information concerning his family or social background. He is referred to merely as Haggai the prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1\">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:1\">Ezr 5:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra6:14\">6:14</a>). His place in the postexilic community seems to have been a conspicuous one, and according to Jewish tradition, he was known as a prophet in Babylon during the exile. The major concern of his prophetic ministry was to encourage the people to rebuild the temple, which had been destroyed during the earlier years of the exile.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4754\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Haggai, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6999\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Prophet, Prophetess</span>.</p>",
