    "content": "<h1>HAGGADAH</h1><p>A method of Jewish interpretation that focuses on storytelling and moral teaching. It is often defined in contrast to Halakah, which provides specific rules and religious laws for Jews to follow. While Halakah offers concrete guidance on religious practices, Haggadah aims to educate and inspire piety and devotion, addressing all aspects of religion and ethics.</p><p>The term Halakah literally means “walking,” guiding Jews on how to live according to God&apos;s ways. In contrast, Haggadah means “narrative” or “storytelling,” and includes various artistic forms intended to teach moral and ethical principles. Haggadah seeks to touch the heart and inspire devotion, helping people connect with God and understand His ways.</p><p>Haggadah is considered more “popular” due to its engaging and relatable nature. Its goal is to make spiritual concepts accessible and to uplift individuals “so that one should recognize him who created the world, and so cling to his ways” (Sifrei-Deuteronomy 49). As one Jewish scholar has said, its purpose is “to bring Heaven down to earth and to elevate man to Heaven.”</p><p>In addition to moral teachings, Haggadah encompasses a range of topics, including metaphysics, historical and legendary tales of Israel, visions of the future, and even scientific subjects like astronomy and medicine. </p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4772\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Halakah</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7892\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Talmud</span>.</p>",
