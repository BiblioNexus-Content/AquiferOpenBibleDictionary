Beetles have different eating habits. Some beetles eat meat, while others mainly eat plants. Some beetles live in water. Some can cause skin blisters. Others can damage fabrics or crops. Some beetles are helpful because they eat harmful insects.</p><p>In ancient Egypt, the beetle, or sacred scarab, was an important symbol. It represented the sun god Ra. The Egyptians made scarab seals and amulets, which were very popular items.</p><p>The word &quot;beetle&quot; is used in the King James Version of the Bible as a translation for &quot;cricket&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:22\">Leviticus 11:22</a>. </p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3860\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cricket</span>.</p>",
