    "content": "<h1>Fear</h1><p>An emotional feeling of anxiety or dread about something bad that might happen in the future. Some people think fear is what drives others toward religion, but true religion involves a desire to draw near to God, not just fear. People do not usually want to get close to someone or something they are afraid of.</p><p>In the Bible, fear means more than just feeling scared or terrified. While this is part of its meaning, especially when talking about the fear of God, it also includes a sense of awe and deep respect for God.</p><p>There is a place for fear in the sense of being anxious or concerned, especially in relation to God. The Bible says, &quot;<span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:31\">Hebrews 10:31</a>). Jesus taught that we should fear God because He has the power to punish sin and destroy people completely (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:4-Luke12:5\">Luke 12:4–5</a>). </p><p>Fear can help people understand how deeply flawed their souls are and how much they need God&apos;s forgiveness. The first example of this kind of fear is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24\">Genesis 3</a>, where Adam and Eve hid from God after they disobeyed Him. Their fear made sense because they knew they deserved judgment for what they did. Fear naturally comes as a result of sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:10\">Genesis 3:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:13-Gen4:14\">4:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov28:1\">Proverbs 28:1</a>). </p><p>The Bible gives many examples of deeply anxious people, like Cain, Saul, Ahaz, and Pilate. Fear grabs hold of the wicked (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job15:24\">Job 15:24</a>), surprises hypocrites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa33:14\">Isaiah 33:14</a>), and overwhelms evildoers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps73:19\">Psalm 73:19</a>). Their lives, lacking faith, are full of fear (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:8\">Revelation 21:8</a>). When God moved against Pharaoh’s army, they were paralyzed by fear (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:16\">Exodus 15:16</a>). Job’s friend Bildad described people as being driven to their knees by God’s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job18:11\">Job 18:11</a>).</p><p>Fear can either stop people from acting or make them behave in ways they would not otherwise. This is especially true for people who are not fully committed to God. </p><ul><li><p>Saul disobeyed God because he was afraid of what the people would think (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:24\">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:24</a>)</p></li><li><p>The parents of the blind man Jesus healed were afraid to speak up for Jesus because they feared the Jewish leaders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:22\">John 9:22</a>)</p></li><li><p>In the parable of the talents, a man’s fear kept him from doing his duty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:25\">Matthew 25:25</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Jesus Christ, through His death, resurrection, and ongoing work for believers in heaven, is the one who frees people from fear. The apostle Paul told the Romans (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:15\">Romans 8:15</a>) that when they became Christians, they received the Holy Spirit, not as a spirit of fear and slavery, but as the spirit of adoption. This means they could now call God “Abba” (an Aramaic term used by Jewish children to address their fathers). This is the same word Jesus used to speak to His Father and Christians because they are part of God’s family, can also use this word when speaking to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:6\">Galatians 4:6</a>). Those who receive God’s love have a powerful force to drive away their fears (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:18\">1&nbsp;John 4:18</a>).</p><p>Unnecessary fear can harm the work of God’s people. God warned Jeremiah not to be afraid of his opponents (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer1:8\">Jeremiah 1:8</a>) because if he gave in to fear, God would allow trouble to come upon him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer1:17\">Jeremiah 1:17</a>). God gave similar commands for courage to Ezekiel, who lived at the same time as Jeremiah, and to many others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:7-Josh1:9\">Joshua 1:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek2:6\">Ezekiel 2:6</a>). Even godly people can be tempted to fear and may sometimes feel overwhelmed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps55:5\">Psalm 55:5</a>). That is why God often tells His people not to give in to fear (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:12\">Isaiah 8:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:1\">John 14:1, 27</a>). Instead, they are encouraged to place their worries in the hands of their Redeemer, who cares deeply for His people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:7\">1&nbsp;Peter 5:7</a>). Faith is the key to overcoming fear, as Isaiah says: “<span>You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, because he trusts in You</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:3\">Isaiah 26:3</a>). The psalmists also emphasize the role of faith in defeating fear (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:1\">Psalms 37:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps46:2\">46:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps112:7\">112:7</a>).</p><p>True faith involves deep respect for God, known as &quot;fear of God&quot; in the Bible. Understanding God&apos;s power is key to meaningful faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps5:7\">Psalms 5:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:7\">89:7</a>). Christians are free from fearing: </p><ul><li><p>People (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:6\">Hebrews 13:6</a>)</p></li><li><p>Death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:15\">2:15</a>)</p></li><li><p>Life in general (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6-2Tim1:7\">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:6–7</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Yet, they should always respect God. This respect brings wisdom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps111:10\">Psalm 111:10</a>) and guidance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:21\">Ephesians 5:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:12\">Philippians 2:12</a>). Loving God leads to this fear through Scripture study (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov2:3-Prov2:5\">Proverbs 2:3–5</a>). </p><p>Ancient Israelites showed reverence by following God&apos;s commands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:2\">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>). Cornelius and his family were called &quot;God-fearers&quot; for their respect (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:2\">Acts 10:2</a>). True reverence leads to good deeds and holy living (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor7:1\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 7:1</a>). This fear brings joy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:11\">Psalm 2:11</a>) and life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov14:27\">Proverbs 14:27</a>). It is more valuable than riches (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov15:16\">Proverbs 15:16</a>). God delights in those who respect Him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps147:11\">Psalm 147:11</a>).</p>",
