    "content": "<h1>BROTHER</h1><p>The term &quot;brother&quot; can refer to:</p><ul><li><p>A man or boy in relation to his siblings</p></li><li><p>A close male friend</p></li><li><p>A fellow member of the same race, creed, profession, or organization.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>What Does &quot;Brother&quot; Mean in the Old Testament?</strong></h2><p>In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for “brother” refers to male children who share at least one parent. Joseph and Benjamin were both children of Jacob and Rachel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:24\">Genesis 35:24</a>). Still, Jacob&apos;s other sons were also Joseph’s brothers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen42:6\">Genesis 42:6</a>). </p><p>The love Joseph had for Benjamin was special and is not always shared between brothers. Cain killed his brother Abel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:8\">Genesis 4:8</a>). Esau hated his brother, Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:41\">27:41</a>). A brother can be a bad influence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:7\">Deuteronomy 13:6</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:7\">7</a>), but ideally he helps in times of need (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov17:17\">Proverbs 17:17</a>). The law of levirate marriage meant that if a man died leaving a childless widow, his brother had to marry her and have children to continue his brother&apos;s family name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:5\">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>).</p><p>David called Jonathan his “brother” even though they were not related (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:26\">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:26</a>). A fellow Israelite could be called brother. The relationship came with certain duties: no one could charge interest on their brother nor enslave him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:43\">Leviticus 25:35</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:43\">43</a>).</p><h2>What Does &quot;Brother&quot; Mean in the New Testament?</h2><p>In the New Testament, the Greek word describes natural brothers, like Andrew and Peter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:41\">John 1:41</a>). Jesus had four brothers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:3\">Mark 6:3</a>). (Roman Catholics believe they were Jesus&apos;s cousins, but the Greek does not use the word for cousin.) Jesus’s brothers did not believe in him at first (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:5\">John 7:5</a>). Still, after the resurrection, they joined the Christian community (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:14\">Acts 1:14</a>). Jesus taught that his disciples had one Father (God) and were all brothers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:9\">Matthew 23:8</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:9\">9</a>). He also was their brother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:10\">Matthew 28:10</a>).</p><p>Early Christians called each other &quot;brother&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:17\">Acts 9:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:1\">Colossians 1:1</a>). Twice, the Christian community is called “the brotherhood” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:17\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:9\">5:9</a>). Being a part of the Christian brotherhood comes with certain duties:</p><ul><li><p>Controlling sexual desires (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:6\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:6</a>)</p></li><li><p>Providing material help when needed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:15-Jas2:16\">James 2:15</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:15-Jas2:16\">16</a>)</p></li><li><p>Avoiding cause for offence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:13\">Romans 14:13</a>). </p></li><li><p>Christians should not “go to law” or sue their brothers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:5-1Cor6:6\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:5</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:5-1Cor6:6\">6</a>)</p></li><li><p>They must resolve their problems either personally in the church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:17\">Matthew 18:15</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:17\">17</a>) </p></li></ul><p>A Christian&apos;s relationship with their brother is significant because they cannot worship God if he is not in harmony with his brother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24\">Matthew 5:23</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24\">24</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4403\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Family Life and Relations</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3519\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Brothers (and Sisters)</span>.</p>",
