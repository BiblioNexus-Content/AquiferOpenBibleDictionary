    "content": "<h1>JUDAS MACCABEUS</h1><p>Judas Maccabeus was the third son of Mattathias. He led a Jewish revolt (a fight for freedom) against foreign rulers in 166 BC.</p><p>His family name, Maccabeus, may come from an Aramaic word that means “the Hammerer.” Later, people used this name for his whole family. His family is also called the Hasmoneans. They helped lead the Jewish people during this time.</p><h2><strong>A Strong Leader Against Syria</strong></h2><p>Judas Maccabeus was one of the great military leaders in Jewish history. He had only a few thousand followers, but they fought against a much larger army from Syria. These armies were sent by a ruler named Lysias, under the command of generals Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias. They followed orders from Antiochus IV Epiphanes. He said to, “wipe out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem; … to banish the memory of them from the place, settle aliens in all their territory, and distribute their land” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:35-1Macc3:36\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 3:35–36</a>, Revised Standard Version). </p><p>Even though the Syrians had over 40,000 foot soldiers and 7,000 horse riders, the Jewish fighters did not give up. They said, “It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary. But as his will in heaven may be, so he will do” (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:59-1Macc3:60\">59–60</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc4:1-1Macc4:25\">First Maccabees 4:1–25</a> records their decisive victory over Gorgias, “Israel had a great deliverance that day” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc4:25\">25</a>).</p><h2><strong>Cleansing the Temple and Honoring God</strong></h2><p>Judas won peace from Lysias in 165 BC. In 164 BC, his army took control of Jerusalem. They cleaned the temple, removing everything used for the worship of Zeus. They also restarted the daily Jewish sacrifices. This important event is remembered during the Jewish festival called Hanukkah. It is also known as the Feast of Dedication (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:22\">John 10:22</a>). </p><p>Judas did not stop fighting. He protected Judea from nearby enemies and became a stronger leader. He also extended Jewish control north to Galilee and east to Gilead. In 163 BC, Syria gave official recognition to the religious freedom of the Jews. As 1&nbsp;Maccabees says,  Lysias told his people: “Let us come to terms with these men, … and agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws which we abolished that they became angry and did all these things” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc6:58-1Macc6:59\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 6:58–59</a>).</p><h2><strong>From Religious Freedom to Political Independence</strong></h2><p>The fight that began with Judas’s father, <strong>M</strong>attathias, started as a protest against religious oppression. Over time, it became a war for political freedom. To help his cause, Judas made a friendship agreement with Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc8:1-1Macc8:32\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 8:1 </a>and following). </p><p>But things changed when <strong>Demetrius I</strong> became the new king of Syria. A Jewish man named <strong>Alcimus</strong> wanted to become high priest. He did not support Judas and brought false charges against him to Demetrius.</p><p>In response, Demetrius sent Bacchides and Alcimus with an army to attack Judas (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc7:1-1Macc7:53\">7:1 </a>and following). They tried to trick Judas and his supporters, but their plan failed. Instead, they killed 60 innocent men from a faithful group called the Hasidim.</p><h2><strong>Judas’s Final Battles and Death</strong></h2><p>So they sent Nicanor, “who hated and detested Israel” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc7:26\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 7:26</a>), with another Syrian army. Judas also defeated Nicanor and his army in 161 BC and “the land of Judah had rest for a few days” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc7:50\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 7:50</a>). </p><p>Later, Bacchides and Alcimus returned with another Syrian army. Judas and his men fought them again. But this time, most of his army had left him. The Jews were outnumbered 20 to 1. Judas was killed in the battle at Alasa (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc9:1-1Macc9:41\">9:1 </a>and following). Israel was deeply sad. They people cried, “How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc9:21\">21</a>). After Judas died, his brothers Jonathan and Simon became the new leaders of the Maccabees.</p>",
