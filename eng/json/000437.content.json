    "content": "<h1>ARAM-NAHARAIM</h1><p>A Hebrew word meaning “Aram of the two rivers.” It refers to the area bounded by the upper Euphrates and the Habur Rivers. It is sometimes translated “Mesopotamia” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut23:4\">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, Revised Standard Version). </p><p>The major city of that area was Haran, where Terah and Abram stopped. It was also where Terah died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen11:32\">Genesis 11:31–32</a>). A servant of Abram (later called Abraham) returned to the same region to seek a wife for Abraham’s son Isaac (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:10\">Genesis 24:1–10</a>). Isaac’s son Jacob also returned to Haran to seek a wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:1-Gen28:5\">Genesis 28:1–5</a>) Paddan-aram is another name for Aram-naharaim. Aram-naharaim was the home of Balaam, who was a pagan prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut23:4\">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). </p><p>One oppressor of Israel during the period of the judges was Cushan-rishathaim, king of Aram-naharaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:8-Judg3:11\">Judges 3:8–11</a>). Later, in King David’s wars with Ammon, he had to confront mercenary charioteers hired from the Aramean centers of Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:6</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps60:1\">Psalm 60 title</a>). <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7853\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Syria, Syrians</span>.</p>",
