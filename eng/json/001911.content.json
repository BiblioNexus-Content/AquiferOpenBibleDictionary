    "content": "<h1>ETHAN</h1><p>1. Wise man comparable to Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:31</a>) and probably the author of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52\">Psalm 89</a>. It is uncertain whether he was a contemporary of Solomon.</p><p>2. Descendant of Judah and son of Zerah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6\">1&nbsp;Chr 2:6</a>), perhaps the same as #1 above. However, they are ascribed different fathers in the two passages.</p><p>3. Son of Zimmah, a descendant of Gershon, Levi’s oldest son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:42\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:42</a>).</p><p>4. Descendant of Levi through his son Merari, and the son of Kishi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:44\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:44</a>) or Kushaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17\">15:17</a>). He was&nbsp;one of three outstanding musicians, along with Heman and Asaph, appointed by David (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:16-1Chr15:19\">16–19</a>). It&nbsp;was probably this Ethan whose name is ascribed in the title to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps39:1-Ps39:13\">Psalm 39</a> (as “Jeduthun,” which he is called in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:41\">1&nbsp;Chr 16:41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1\">25:1</a>) as “chief musician”; it is likely that he composed the music for the psalm.</p>",
