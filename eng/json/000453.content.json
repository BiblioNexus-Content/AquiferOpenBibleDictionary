The Archevites were moved to Samaria by Asnappar, the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9-Ezra4:10\">Ezra 4:9–10</a>). The Archevites were local residents. They wrote to Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem by the Jews who had returned from exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:16\">Ezra 4:7–16</a>).</p>",
