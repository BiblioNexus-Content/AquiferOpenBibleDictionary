Some plants grow thorns to protect themselves.</p><p>The Bible often mentions thorns. They can be part of the land’s natural plants, or they can be a symbol of pain, trouble, or punishment. For example, after Adam and Eve sinned, God said the ground would grow thorns and thistles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:18\">Genesis 3:18</a>).</p><p>People also used thorns to make a crown and put it on Jesus’s head to mock him before his death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:29\">Matthew 27:29</a>).</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7988\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Thistle, Thorn</span>.</p>",
