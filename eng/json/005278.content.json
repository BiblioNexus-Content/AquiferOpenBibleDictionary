    "content": "<h1>SLEEP</h1><p>The natural state of rest for the body and mind. In the Bible, sleep can mean three things:</p><ol><li><p>physical rest </p></li><li><p>moral or spiritual inactivity</p></li><li><p>death</p></li></ol><h2>Sleep as Physical Rest</h2><p>The sleep that the human body needs is seen as a precious gift of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps4:8\">Psalms 4:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps127:2\">127:2</a>). Sleep may be withheld, as God chooses and to serve his purposes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth6:1\">Esther 6:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan6:18\">Daniel 6:18</a>). God may also, give people deep sleep (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:21\">Genesis 2:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:12\">15:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:12\">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:12</a>). When a person is sleeping, God may make his will known in dreams or visions (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">Genesis 28:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:13-Job4:17\">Job 4:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:13-Job4:17\">17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:20-Matt1:24\">Mt 1:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:20-Matt1:24\">24</a>).</p><p>The book of Proverbs warns against a lack of discipline of life shown in too much love of sleep. For example, one proverb says, &quot;<span>Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of food.</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov20:13\">Proverbs 20:13</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov6:9-Prov6:11\">6:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov6:9-Prov6:11\">11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov10:5\">10:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov24:32-Prov24:34\">24:32</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov24:32-Prov24:34\">34</a>).</p><h2>Sleep as Moral or Spiritual Inactivity</h2><p>In a symbolic way, sleep is used to mean laziness, carelessness, or inactivity. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa56:10\">Isaiah 56:10</a> speaks of those who failed in their responsibility as leaders of God’s people: &quot;<span>They are dreamers lying around, loving to slumber.&quot;</span> In the New Testament, those who are the Lord’s servants are called to be alert, so that when their Master comes he will not find them sleeping (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:35-Mark13:37\">Mark 13:35</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:35-Mark13:37\">37</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13\">Matthew 25:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:13\">13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:40-Matt26:46\">26:40</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:11-Gen28:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:40-Matt26:46\">46</a>).  The challenge to be spiritually alert comes occurs in the New Testament letters: </p><ul><li><p><span>&quot;Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:14\">Ephesians 5:14</a>). </p></li><li><p><span>&quot;So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:6\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:6)</a>.</p></li></ul><h2>Sleep as Death</h2><p>The Bible often speaks of death as sleep. Commonly in the Old Testament, when a person dies, he is said to go to sleep with his fathers (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:16\">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:12</a>). </p><p>Jesus spoke of death as sleep (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:24\">Matthew 9:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:11\">John 11:11</a>). So did the apostle Paul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:30\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20,1Cor15:51\">15:20, 51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:14\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:13–14</a>). Some of these statements show that there is a temporary nature to death. This is why it is called sleep. Even <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:2\">Daniel 12:2</a> says that death is a sleep, until the dead &quot;<span>awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt.&quot;</span> </p><p>Other passages in the New Testament are more specific. The full teaching of the Bible on the meaning of death should include the context <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:43\">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:8\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:8</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:23\">Philippians 1:23</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:13-1Thess5:14\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:13–14</a>. In the first of these, Jesus says to the dying thief on the cross, &quot;Today you will be with me in paradise.&quot; In the second, Paul speaks of death for him as going to be &quot;<span>at home with the Lord</span>.&quot;</p>",
