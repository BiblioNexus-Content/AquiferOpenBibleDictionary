    "content": "<h1>TALITHA CUMI</h1><p>Jesus spoke these Aramaic words as recorded by Mark in his Gospel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:41\">Mark 5:41</a>). Jairus, a synagogue official in the Galilean region, called on Jesus to heal his sick daughter. The girl died before Jesus arrived. When he arrived, Jesus took the girl&apos;s hand and said, <em>&quot;Talitha cumi,&quot;</em> meaning &quot;Little girl, arise.&quot; <em>&quot;Talitha&quot;</em> is a term of affection meaning &quot;lamb&quot; or &quot;youth.&quot; <em>&quot;Cumi&quot;</em> is a command to rise up. Mark translated the word as &quot;I say to you, arise!&quot;</p><p>In his Gospel, Mark includes other Aramaic phrases Jesus spoke (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:17\">Mark 3:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:41\">5:41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:11,Mark7:34\">7:11, 34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:9-Mark11:10\">11:9â€“10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:36\">14:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:22,Mark15:34\">15:22, 34</a>). Matthew only records two Aramaic phrases (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:33,Matt27:46\">Matthew 27:33, 46</a>). Luke&apos;s gospel includes none of these phrases.</p>",
