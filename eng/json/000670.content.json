God chose to be called <em>’ishi,</em> “my husband.” The meaning of the two terms were similar but was not associated with pagan practices. In a prophetic play on words, God stressed his covenantal love for his people and rejected any implication that he the same for Israel as Baal was for the Canaanites. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3105\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Baal (Idol)</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4667\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">God, Names of</span>.</p>",
