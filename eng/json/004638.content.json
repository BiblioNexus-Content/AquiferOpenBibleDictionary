    "content": "<h1>RACA</h1><p>A derogatory expression used by Jews of the first century AD to show open contempt for another. <em>Raca</em> is derived from an Aramaic and Hebrew term meaning “empty” or “worthless.” Raca means &quot;empty-headed.&quot; It likely insults one&apos;s intellect, not morals. </p><p>In the Old Testament, it is comparable to: </p><ul><li><p>The worthless lot that Abimelech hired to follow him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:4\">Judges 9:4</a>)</p></li><li><p>The idle men who gathered around Jephthah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg11:3\">Judges 11:3</a>)</p></li><li><p>The scoundrels who joined Jeroboam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr13:7\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:7</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Michal accused David of acting like a vulgar fellow [<em>raca</em>] who shamelessly exposed himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:20\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:20</a>). Rabbinic literature used this term to describe an immoral, untrained person.</p><p>Jesus warned against calling a brother <em>“Raca!”</em> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:22\">Matthew 5:22</a>). Jesus said to judge the insulter and punish them with the highest penalty. The commandment against murder (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:13\">Exodus 20:13</a>) banned the act, angry thoughts, and contempt.</p>",
