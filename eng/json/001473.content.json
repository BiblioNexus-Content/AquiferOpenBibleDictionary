The name appears also in Assyrian and Babylonian sources. In 1881 Hormuzd Rassam identified Cuthah as an ancient city whose towering ruins are located at modern Tell Ibrahim, about 20 miles (32.2&nbsp;kilometers) northeast of Babylon. Cuthah was the location of a temple dedicated to Nergal, its patron deity (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:30\">30</a>).</p><p>The Cuthans seem to have been a predominant segment of the population of postexilic Samaria, since Jews in later centuries applied that name to Samaritans in general. The religious syncretism of which the Cuthans were a part produced hostilities between Judah and Samaria following the Jews’ return from their exile. That animosity between Jews and Samaritans continued across the centuries to Jesus’ day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:7-John4:9\">Jn 4:7–9</a>).</p>",
