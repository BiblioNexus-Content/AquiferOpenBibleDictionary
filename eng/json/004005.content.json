The king respected him for his character and military successes even though he had leprosy. This did not exclude him from society, as it would have done in Israel (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:1-Lev14:57\">Leviticus 13–14</a>). Ben-hadad&apos;s allowed him to bring gifts to the court of his very suspicious neighboring king. This king was probably Jehoram. </p><p>Elisha, the prophet, intervened and required an unlikely method of healing. The reluctant Naaman followed through. His servants said, &quot;If the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?&quot; Naaman then confessed that the one true God is in Israel. He returned home with two mule-loads (the amount one mule can carry) of earth, thinking he could only worship this God on his ground (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:24\">Exodus 20:24</a>). </p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:27\">Luke 4:27</a>, Jesus reminds his synagogue listeners of how Naaman, a non-Israelite, was the only one of his time to be cleansed of leprosy.</p></li></ol>",
