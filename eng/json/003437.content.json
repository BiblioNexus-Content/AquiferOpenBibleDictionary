    "content": "<h1>LAVER</h1><p>A laver is a large basin filled with water that the priests used to wash their hands and feet before entering the Holy Place and before serving at the altar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:17-Exod30:21\">Exodus 30:17–21</a>).  In Solomon&apos;s temple, a large laver called the &quot;molten sea&quot; was between the altar of burnt offerings in the courtyard and the inner temple&apos;s entrance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:23\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:23</a>). The laver was the large basin and the pedestal it sat on (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:18\">Exodus 30:18</a>). It was made of bronze or brass, melted and shaped from mirrors of highly polished metal given by Israelite women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod38:8\">Exodus 38:8</a>).</p><p>In Solomon’s temple, in addition to the molten sea, there were ten smaller lavers, five on each the&nbsp;north and south sides of the sanctuary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:38-1Kgs7:39\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:38–39</a>). Each held 40 baths (1,211.2–1,665.4 liters, or 320–440 gallons), one-fiftieth the capacity of the large laver. The priests used the molten sea for their ritual washing. The ten lavers were for the sacrifices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:6\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:6</a>).  Later, King Ahaz, for religious or financial reasons, severed the lavers and the sea from their bases. He placed them on a stone pediment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:17\">2&nbsp;Kings 16:17</a>). The prophet Jeremiah, during King Jehoiakim’s reign, predicted that the molten sea and the bases would be carried into Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer27:19-Jer27:22\">Jeremiah 27:19–22</a>). This indeed happened, as recorded in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer52:17\">Jeremiah 52:17</a>. The text does not mention what happened to the ten small lavers. They were perhaps already melted down and sold.</p><p>In Ezekiel’s description of the future temple, there is no mention of a laver or molten sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek42:20\">Ezekiel 40–42</a>). However, the apostle John in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:6\">Revelation 4:6</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev15:2\">15:2</a> mentions a &quot;sea of glass.&quot; This &quot;sea of glass&quot; might be similar to or bring to mind Solomon&apos;s molten sea.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3511\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bronze Sea</span>.</p>",
