Levite who opposed Ezra’s suggestion that the sons of Israel should divorce the foreign women they had married upon returning to Palestine from exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:15\">Ezr 10:15</a>). He explained the law to the people at Ezra’s reading (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:7\">Neh 8:7</a>).</p><p>2. One of the chiefs of the Levites who oversaw the outside work of the sanctuary during the postexilic period (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:16\">Neh 11:16</a>). He is perhaps identical with #1 above.</p>",
