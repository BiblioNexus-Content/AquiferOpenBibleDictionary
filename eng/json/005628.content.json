    "content": "<h1>TOBIAH</h1><ol><li><p>The ancestor of a family of people who returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem after the exile in Babylon. This family was not able to prove their Jewish heritage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:60\">Ezra 2:60</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:62\">Nehemiah 7:62</a>).</p></li><li><p>An Ammonite who opposed Nehemiah when he arrived in Jerusalem about 445 BC. Tobiah is called “the Ammonite official” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:10,Neh2:19\">Nehemiah 2:10, 19</a>, a term describing an important person with power, like a governor. He, Sanballat, and Geshem were the main opponents of the wall&apos;s reconstruction. They were high-ranking Persian Empire officers. He was connected by marriage with the Jews in two ways. He married Shecaniah&apos;s daughter, the son of Arah. His son Jehohanan married Meshullam&apos;s daughter, the son of Berekiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:18\">Nehemiah 6:18</a>). His marriage to a prominent Jerusalem family gave him strong ties with the city&apos;s aristocracy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:17\">Nehemiah 6:17</a>).</p><p>Nehemiah had to face the threat posed by Tobiah and his influential allies. Nehemiah was accused of leading the people of Jerusalem in a revolt against King Artaxerxes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:19\">Nehemiah 2:19</a>). As the wall was rebuilt, Tobiah planned to besiege Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:8\">Nehemiah 4:8</a>). Nehemiah ordered the Jews to defend themselves. They continued to repair the wall, protected by armed guards. As the enemy forces drew closer, every worker held a weapon, along with his trowel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:17-Neh4:19\">Nehemiah 4:17–19</a>). They believed that “<span>Our God will fight for us</span>” and were encouraged (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:20\">Nehemiah 4:20</a>). Tobiah also joined in the plot to assassinate Nehemiah after the walls were rebuilt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:2-Neh6:4\">Nehemiah 6:2–4</a>). Nehemiah was accused of false reports of rebellion. A Jerusalemite, hired by the allies, tried to tempt him into entering the temple. This would discredit his standing among the faithful (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:5-Neh6:13\">Nehemiah 6:5–13</a>).</p><p>After Nehemiah left Jerusalem to meet Artaxerxes, Tobiah regained his followers. The priest Eliashib, related to Tobiah, then converted a temple offering room for him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:4-Neh13:5\">Nehemiah 13:4–5</a>). Tobiah used these quarters when visiting Jerusalem. One of Nehemiah’s first actions, upon his return, was to evict Tobiah from the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:8-Neh13:9\">Nehemiah 13:8–9</a>) and then restore the room for its proper use.</p></li></ol>",
