It means “the lodging place of Kimham.” Geruth-kimham was possibly given to Kimham because of the service that his father, Barzillai the Gileadite, had provided to King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:31-2Sam19:40\">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:31–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:7\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:7</a>). </p><p>After Jerusalem fell in 586 BC, Geruth-kimham became the camp where Johanan son of Kareah and his men stayed. This is where they prepared to escape to Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:17\">Jeremiah 41:17</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5752\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Kimham</span>.</p>",
