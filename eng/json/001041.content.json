    "content": "<h1>BOOK OF LIFE</h1><p>A term used to refer to a record kept in heaven. </p><p>The phrase appears seven times in the New Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:3\">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:5\">Revelation 3:5</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:5\"> </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:8\">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:8\">Revelation 17:8</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:8\"> </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:12,Rev20:15\">Revelation 20:12</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:12,Rev20:15\"> Revelation 20:15</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:12,Rev20:15\"> </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:27\">Revelation 21:27).</a></p><p>The idea comes from the Old Testament, where several passages descrtibe God keeping a record of his people. Examples include <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod32:32\">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps87:6\">Psalm 87:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:10\">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:1\">12:1</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:16\">Malachi 3:16</a>. These passages show that God records both the faithful actions and disobedience of his people. Some passages suggest God might also keep records of other nations (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps87:6\">Psalm 87:6</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps69:28\">Psalm 69:28</a>, we find the phrase “Book of Life,” and the surrounding poetic lines refer to physical life.</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:10\">Daniel 7:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:1\">12:1</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:16\">Malachi 3:16</a> connect divine records with final judgment and end-time events. These passages describe names and deeds as evidence before a judge. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:20\">Luke 10:20</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:23\">Hebrews 12:23</a> share this idea but do not mention a “book.” However, a heavenly record is assumed. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:3\">Philippians 4:3</a>, Paul uses the term “Book of Life” to give them hope about their future with God.</p><p>In the book of Revelation, the &quot;Book of Life&quot; is a heavenly record that contains the names of people who stay faithful to God. It first appears in Revelation in the letter to the church in Sardis (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:5\">Revelation 3:5</a>). Jesus, who is called &quot;the Lamb,&quot; keeps this book (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:8\">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:7\">21:7</a>). If a person’s name is found in the book, they are allowed to enter the new Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:15\">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:27\">21:27</a>). If one’s name is not written there, their judgment is final destruction. Revelation tells us these names were “written from the foundation of the world” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:8\">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev17:8\">17:8</a>). This shows that God has always known and cared for his people.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3468\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Book of Remembrance</span>.</p>",
