The correct name is preserved in the Assyrian annals of Sennacherib as Mahalliba; another text has Mahalab. The town is sometimes identified with Khirbet el-Mahalib, northeast of Tyre.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2630\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Ahlab</span>.</p>",
