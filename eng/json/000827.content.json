The Masoretic Text <span>(the Old Testament written in Hebrew, with notes added by Jewish scholars during the Middle Ages)</span> and the King James Version include the name Ben. Still, the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) and modern versions do not include it because it is not used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:20\">1 Chronicles 15:20</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:21\">21</a>. Since the Masoretic Text also does not include it in the later verses, the addition of Ben in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:18\">1 Chronicles 15:18</a> may be a scribal error.</p>",
