    "content": "<h1>UZZIEL</h1><ol><li><p>The youngest son of Kohath from the tribe of Levi. Uzziel became the leader of the Uzzielite family group within the larger Kohathite clan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:18\">Exodus 6:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num3:19,Num3:27,Num3:30\">Numbers 3:19, 27, 30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:23\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:23</a>). He was the uncle of Aaron, and his sons Mishael and Elzaphan carried the bodies of Nadab and Abihu outside the camp after they disobeyed Aaron&apos;s authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:22\">Exodus 6:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:4\">Leviticus 10:4</a>).  Several of his descendants were important in Israel&apos;s history. Amminadab led the ceremony when David moved the ark to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:10\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:10</a>). Micah and Isshiah were leaders among the Levites during King Solomon&apos;s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr23:20\">1 Chronicles 23:20</a>)</p></li><li><p>The son of Ishi who was one of the leaders of the Simeonite warriors. These warriors defeated the Amalekites at Seir during the time when Hezekiah was king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:42\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:42</a>). This was an important victory because the Amalekites had not been completely defeated earlier by King Saul or King David. As a result of this victory, the Simeonites were able to take over and live in that land. </p></li><li><p>A Benjaminite clan chief who is listed as the son of Bela, the son of Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:7\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:7</a>).</p></li><li><p>The son of Heman of the Levite clan of Asaph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:4\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 25:4</a>). He is also called Azarel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:18\">1 Chronicles 25:18</a>).</p></li><li><p>A Levite who helped with the reconsecration (the ceremony to make holy again) of the temple during King Hezekiah&apos;s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 29:14</a>). He is listed as the son of Jeduthun.</p></li><li><p>A goldsmith who worked on rebuilding the gates of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:8\">Nehemiah 3:8</a>). His name suggests he was probably a priest who had the job of making and repairing the instruments and containers used in the temple (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:29\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 9:29</a>).</p></li></ol>",
