    "content": "<h1>RICHES</h1><p>Riches are a large amount of wealth. This can include money, land, buildings, animals, or slaves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:8-Isa5:10\">Isaiah 5:8–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:2-1Sam25:3\">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:18\">8:11</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:18\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam8:11-1Sam8:18\">18</a>). People with great riches often had great power and influence. The Hebrew word for wealth includes the idea of strength and power.</p><p>The Bible has mixed views on wealth. Sometimes, it describes material wealth as a sign of God’s blessing (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:35\">Genesis 24:35</a>), but at other times, it associates being rich with wickedness (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:7,Ps37:16\">Psalm 37:7, 16</a>).</p><p>God made all things for people to enjoy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:17\">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:17</a>). People who are rich should thank God, not be proud or trust in their wealth. Everything in the world belongs to God, the Creator (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps24:1\">Psalm 24:1</a>). But the Bible also warns that some wealth comes from injustice and is not a blessing from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:9-Hab2:11\">Habakkuk 2:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos8:4-Amos8:6\">Amos 8:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer22:13\">Jeremiah 22:13</a>).</p><p>When wealth is gained in a right way, it can be seen as a gift from God. King David showed this when he prayed, “<span>Both riches and honor come from You</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr29:12\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 29:12</a>). Even when wealth is earned through hard work, the Bible teaches that God gives us both our talents and resources. Jesus taught this truth in the parables of the 10 talents (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:14-Matt25:30\">Matthew 25:14</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:14-Matt25:30\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:14-Matt25:30\">30</a>) and the 10 minas (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:11-Luke19:26\">Luke 19:11</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:11-Luke19:26\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:11-Luke19:26\">26</a>).</p><p>The Bible does not say that having wealth is wrong. The Ten Commandments would not forbid stealing and envy if owning things was wrong. Jesus never said it was a sin to be rich.</p><p>However, Jesus warned that riches can make it hard to enter the kingdom of God: “<span>How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:23\">Mark 10:23</a>). Jesus taught that wealth:</p><ul><li><p>Can destroy peace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:24-Matt6:34\">Matthew 6:24</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:24-Matt6:34\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:24-Matt6:34\">34</a>)</p></li><li><p>Blind people to the needs of others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">Luke 16:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">31</a>)</p></li><li><p>Block the way to eternal life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:27\">Mark 10:17</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:27\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:27\">27</a>)</p></li><li><p>Bring God’s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:16-Luke12:21\">Luke 12:16</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:16-Luke12:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:16-Luke12:21\">21</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Jesus told His followers not to store up personal wealth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:19\">Matthew 6:19</a>), and he praised those who gave up their possessions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:29\">Matthew 19:29</a>).</p><p>Jesus&apos;s warnings are not against wealth itself but against the wrong attitudes and uses of it. A desire for wealth, rather than the possession of riches, can choke spiritual growth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:22\">Matthew 13:22</a>). Greed led to the downfall of the unforgiving servant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35\">Matthew 18:23</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:35\">35</a>), and the rich man’s selfishness, not his wealth, led to his doom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:26\">Luke 16:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:26\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:26\">26</a>). Paul summed it up by saying, “<span>The <em>love</em> of money is the root of all kinds of evil</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:10\">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:10</a>, emphasis added).</p><p>The biggest danger is when wealth controls a person’s life. The Bible warns against making material things an idol (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:17-Deut8:18\">Deuteronomy 8:17</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:17-Deut8:18\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:17-Deut8:18\">18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24\">Luke 14:15</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24\">24</a>). Satan tempted Jesus to choose wealth and power instead of obeying God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:9\">Matthew 4:8</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:9\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:9\">9</a>). But Jesus warned against serving money as a master (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:24\">Matthew 6:24</a>). Jesus told a rich young man to sell everything (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:22\">Mark 10:17</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:22\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:22\">22</a>). The wealthy man had allowed his possessions to rule over him. Jesus wanted him to realize that his riches were controlling him, so he could let go and follow God. But the man chose to keep his riches and walked away. This shows how strong the desire for wealth can be.</p><p>Jesus’s teachings on wealth include not only warnings but also guidance on the right attitudes. Those who see themselves as stewards of their possessions, not owners, will find many ways to use their wealth for God’s service (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:42-Luke12:44\">Luke 12:42</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:42-Luke12:44\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:42-Luke12:44\">44</a>). Instead of making them greedy, their riches should allow them to express love in many practical ways (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:2\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:2</a>). Their riches should lead them to trust in God rather than being anxious (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:29-Luke12:31\">Luke 12:29</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:29-Luke12:31\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:29-Luke12:31\">31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:17\">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:17</a>).</p><p>The Bible teaches that the morality of wealth depends on one’s attitude. People who make money their main goal in life have the wrong values. Even if they seem rich, they are poor in God’s eyes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:26\">Matthew 16:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:17\">Revelation 3:17</a>). In his view, the truly rich are the people who serve Christ as King (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:44-Matt13:46\">Matthew 13:44</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:44-Matt13:46\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:44-Matt13:46\">46</a>). True wealth is about serving God and living a life of faith and good deeds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim6:18\">1&nbsp;Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:5\">James 2:5</a>)—a wealth that nothing can get rid of: “<span>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:21\">Matthew 6:21</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6362\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Money</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6945\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Poor, The</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8193\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wages</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8211\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wealth</span>.</p>",
