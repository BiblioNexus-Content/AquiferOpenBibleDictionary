So, it would have been natural for Christians to refer to themselves as &quot;the friends of Christ.&quot; Some philosophical groups in the Greek world used terms of friendship to describe close relationships between their members. However, early Christians chose to use other words to describe themselves, such as &quot;followers of Jesus&quot; or &quot;disciples.&quot;</p>",
