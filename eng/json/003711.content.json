His descendants inhabited northwestern Arabia. Tiglath-pileser III mentions these people, along with the inhabitants of Tema (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:15\">Gn 25:15</a>) and others who were ruled by him and paid tribute to him. The people of Tema probably were descendants of Massa’s brother Tema.</p><p>Massa forms part of the titles of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov30:1\">Proverbs 30:1</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov31:1\">31:1</a>. The definite article precedes it in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov30:1\">30:1</a> and can be translated “the burden” or “the oracle.” It is frequently used in prophetic passages in the ominous sense of God’s impending judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa13:1\">Is 13:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah1:1\">Na 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab1:1\">Hb 1:1</a>).</p>",
