    "content": "<h1>Wild Gourd</h1><p>The wild gourd appears in the Bible in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:39\">2&nbsp;Kings 4:39</a>, where one of Elisha&apos;s followers unknowingly gathered its fruit and added it to a stew during a famine. When people tasted it, they cried out, &quot;There is death in the pot!&quot; because of its extreme bitterness and potential toxicity. Most scholars identify this plant as <em>Citrullus colocynthis</em> (colocynth or bitter apple), a vine that spreads along the ground or climbs over shrubs and fences.</p><p>The colocynth fruit looks like a small, round gourd and contains a spongy, bitter pulp. In large amounts, it can cause severe stomach distress and act as a strong laxative.</p><p>Some scholars suggest that the bitterness of colocynth may explain why the Bible sometimes uses the word &quot;gall&quot; (<em>rosh</em> in Hebrew) as a symbol of extreme bitterness or poison (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps69:21\">Psalm 69:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam3:5,Lam3:19\">Lamentations 3:5, 19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:34\">Matthew 27:34</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4687\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Gourd</span>.</p>",
