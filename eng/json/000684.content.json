    "content": "<h1>BAASHA</h1><p>Baasha was the third king of the northern kingdom of Israel, ruling from 908 to 886 BC. He was a fierce leader who started the second of Israel&apos;s nine dynasties. Baasha was the son of Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar. The Lord chose him from among the common people to lead the army (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:2\">1&nbsp;Kings 16:2</a>). While the Israelite army was attacking Gibbethon, where Philistines were living, Baasha killed King Nadab. He also wiped out all the family members of the former king, Nadab&apos;s father Jeroboam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27-1Kgs15:29\">1 Kings 15:27</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27-1Kgs15:29\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27-1Kgs15:29\">29</a>). </p><p>During his 24-year rule, Baasha fought against Asa, the king of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:16,1Kgs15:32\">1 Kings 15:16, 32</a>).The conflict was mainly about controlling trade routes between Israel and Judah. To block trade with Jerusalem, Baasha built a stronghold at Ramah, which was north of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:17,1Kgs15:21\">1 Kings 15:17, 21</a>)To counter this, Asa took all the silver and gold from the temple and his own palace and bribed King Ben-hadad of Syria to turn against Baasha (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:18-1Kgs15:20\">1 Kings 15:18</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:18-1Kgs15:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:18-1Kgs15:20\">20</a>). Ben-hadad then attacked several of Israel&apos;s northern cities and took land near the Jordan River. This made Baasha lose his resolve, and he withdrew from Judah’s borders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20-1Kgs15:21\">1 Kings 15:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20-1Kgs15:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20-1Kgs15:21\">21</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5757\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Kings, Books of First and Second</span>.</p>",
