    "content": "<h1>OBED-EDOM</h1><ol><li><p>A man who took care of the ark of the covenant when David was moving it from Gibeah to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:10-2Sam6:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:10–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr13:5-1Chr13:14\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:5–14</a>). The Bible calls him a<span> </span>Gittite, which indicates that his birthplace was Gath. This was probably not the Philistine city of Gath, but a Levitical town called Gath-rimmon in the land of Dan. It is the same place as “Gath-rimmon” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:45\">Joshua 19:45</a>). Obed-edom was likely a Levite, which made him able to care for the ark.</p><p>Earlier, a man named Uzzah had touched the ark to keep it from falling. Because this broke the law, he died right away. David became afraid and decided not to move the ark to Jerusalem yet. Obed-edom lived nearby, so David left the ark in his house.</p><p>After three months, David heard that God had blessed Obed-edom’s family. David realized that Uzzah had died because the ark was not being carried in the right way according to the law of Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num4:15\">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:9\">7:9</a>). IIt was not because God was angry with Uzzah as a person. David then had the ark moved the right way to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:25-1Chr15:28\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:25–28</a>). Later, Obed-edom may have become a gatekeeper for the ark in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:24\">15:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:4,1Chr26:8,1Chr26:15\">26:4, 8, 15</a>). Some scholars think this may have been a different man with the same name.</p></li><li><p>A Levite musician who played music in front of the ark (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:21\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5,1Chr16:38\">16:5, 38</a>). He was the son of Jeduthun, one of David’s lead singers. Some scholars think this Obed-edom was a different person from the man who cared for the ark.</p></li><li><p>A Levite who guarded the of the holy items in the temple. King Joash later took these items during a raid (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:24\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:24</a>).</p></li></ol>",
