It was assigned as one of the four Levitical cities for the Kohathites in Dan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:24\">21:24</a>). Lost to the Canaanites, Gath-rimmon was later regained by Ephraim and included as one of its cities for the sons of Levi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:69\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:69</a>). Its site is identifiable with the modern Tell el-Jerisheh.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5900\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Levitical Cities</span>.</p><p>2. One of two cities given to the Levites in Manasseh west of the Jordan River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:25\">Jos 21:25</a>), suggesting a possible transcription mistake, which is better read as Bileam (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:70\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:70</a>).</p>",
