Some suggest that this time indicator was not a sundial but a stairway. The time of day was determined by the position of the shadow of some object cast on the stairs. At Isaiah’s command, the Lord miraculously caused the shadow to recede ten steps, divinely confirming to King Hezekiah of Judah (715–686 BC) that he would recover from his illness, live 15 more years, and be delivered from the Assyrian threat (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:7-2Kgs20:11\">2&nbsp;Kgs 20:7–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa38:7-Isa38:8\">Is 38:7–8</a>).</p>",
