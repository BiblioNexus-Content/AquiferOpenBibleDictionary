The parallel verse in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:18\">1&nbsp;Kings 9:18</a> reads “Tamar” in some Hebrew manuscripts and it is uncertain if the same city was intended.</p><p>Solomon built or rebuilt a number of cities, including store cities and cities for his horses and chariots. Among the cities mentioned is “Tadmor in the desert.” Tadmor, situated some 140 miles (225.3&nbsp;kilometers) northeast of Damascus, is mentioned in the records of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I (c. 1114–c. 1076 BC).</p><p>In Greek and Roman times, the city was known as Palmyra, whose ruins may be seen today. The oasis city was an important stopping place on the caravan route, and therefore could have been valuable to Solomon in his extensive trading ventures. It gained its greatest prominence during the reign of Queen Zenobia. The Roman Aurelian destroyed it in AD 273. Though rebuilt, it never regained its former position.</p>",
