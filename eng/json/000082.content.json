Even though David had killed Goliath, Gath’s champion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17</a>), David ran from Saul to Achish’s court. When he realized his mistake, David pretended to be crazy to save his life. This caused Achish to throw him out (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:10</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15\">15</a>). Later, when David came back to Gath with 600 fighters, Achish gave him the city of Ziklag to use as a base (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1-1Sam27:7\">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1-1Sam27:7\">7</a>). Achish thought David’s men were attacking the Israelites. Instead, they were destroying Philistine towns (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8-1Sam27:12\">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:8</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8-1Sam27:12\">12</a>).</p>",
