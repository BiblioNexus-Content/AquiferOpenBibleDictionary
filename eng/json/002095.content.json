    "content": "<h1>GALBANUM</h1><p>Galbanum is a sticky, aromatic resin that comes from a tall plant in the <em>Apiaceae</em> family, which also includes carrots and parsley. It was one of the ingredients in the special incense used in the tabernacle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod30:34\">Exodus 30:34</a>). </p><p>The galbanum plant (<em>Ferula galbaniflua</em> or <em>Ferula gummosa</em>) grows naturally in regions such as Syria and Persia. It has small, greenish-white flowers and fruit that grow in clusters at the top of its stem. Its leaves are divided into many small parts, resembling those of parsley or carrot plants.</p><p>To collect galbanum, people cut the plantâ€™s stem near the ground. This releases a milky liquid. This liquid hardens into a waxy, brownish resin. Today, galbanum is sometimes used in making varnish and perfumes.</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Sir24:15\">Sirach 24:15</a> describes galbanum as having a pleasing aroma. By itself, galbanum has a strong, pungent smell when burned. But it was evidently mixed with other substances to make a pleasant-smelling ointment.</p>",
