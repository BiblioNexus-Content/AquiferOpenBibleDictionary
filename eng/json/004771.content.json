    "content": "<h1>RIDDLE</h1><p>A riddle is a word puzzle that asks people to find a hidden meaning. People in the ancient world enjoyed riddles both for fun and as a way to test wisdom. Unlike fables (stories that teach obvious lessons), riddles were meant to be challenging to solve.</p><h2>Riddles in the Old Testament</h2><p>Fables in the Bible often used stories about plants or animals to teach clear lessons. For example, Jotham told a story about plants choosing a king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:7-Judg9:15\">Judges 9:7–15</a>). The meaning of his story was easy to understand. Sometimes, it can be hard to tell if something is a riddle or a fable. For instance, Ezekiel wrote what some people call a riddle about plants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek17:1-Ezek17:24\">Ezekiel 17</a>), but others think it is more like a fable because its meaning is clearer than most riddles.</p><p>Samson’s riddle at his wedding feast is the most famous riddle in the Bible (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:1-Judg14:20\">Judges 14</a>). People often shared riddles at celebrations like this (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:12-Judg14:13\">12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:7-Judg9:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:12-Judg14:13\">13</a>). Samson&apos;s riddle had two lines (called a couplet): &quot;From the one who eats came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet&quot; (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:14\">14</a>). The answer came from an earlier event when Samson had killed a lion and later found honey in its body. The thirty young men at the feast threatened Samson&apos;s future wife to get her to find out the answer from him. They answered his riddle by asking: &quot;What is&nbsp;sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?&quot; (verse&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:18\">18</a>).</p><p>King Solomon’s wisdom was demonstrated by his ability to answer the queen of Sheba&apos;s &quot;difficult questions&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:1-1Kgs10:4\">1&nbsp;Kings 10:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:7-Judg9:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:1-1Kgs10:4\">4</a>). A Jewish text called Sirach (also known as Ecclesiasticus) praises Solomon, saying: &quot;Your soul covered the earth, and you filled it with parables and riddles&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Sir47:15\">Sirach 47:15</a>).</p><p>A Jewish historian named Josephus wrote about a contest between Solomon and King Hiram where they exchanged riddles. Solomon won most of the time, but Hiram finally won one round by getting help from others (<em>Antiquities</em> 8.5.5). The wise people of Israel often claimed they could solve riddles (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps49:4\">Psalms 49:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov1:6\">Proverbs 1:6</a>). The book of Daniel mentions riddles several times. It describes a future ruler as &quot;<span>skilled in intrigue</span>&quot; (literally, &quot;one who understands riddles&quot;) who would rise to power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:23-Dan8:24\">Daniel 8:23</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:7-Judg9:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan8:23-Dan8:24\">24</a>). Daniel could also &quot;interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan5:12\">Daniel 5:12</a>).</p><h2>Riddles in the New Testament</h2><p>The New Testament has fewer riddles. The various &quot;hard sayings&quot; of Jesus (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:60\">John 6:60</a>) are difficult to accept and just as hard to understand. Perhaps the only true riddle is the number of the beast, 666 (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev13:18\">Revelation 13:18</a>). Many scholars think this number might refer to the Roman Emperor Nero, as this kind of number code was common in ancient writing.</p>",
