    "content": "<h1>BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD</h1><p>A document mentioned once in the Old Testament. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:14\">Numbers 21:14 </a>mentions it in a description of the border of Moab at the Arnon River. Although we no longer have this book today, ancient writers used it as a source of information. The book probably contained records of how Israel conquered the land east of the Jordan River (called Transjordan). </p><p>It may be the same as “the Book of Jashar” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:13\">Joshua 10:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:18\">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:18</a>). The passage in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:1-Num21:35\">Numbers 21</a> is written like poetry and talks about Israel&apos;s battles and victories. Scholars disagree about which verses come from the Book of the Wars of the Lord. Some think it is only verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:14\">14</a>, while others include verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:15\">15</a>, and still others include verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:27-Num21:30\">27–30</a>.</p>",
