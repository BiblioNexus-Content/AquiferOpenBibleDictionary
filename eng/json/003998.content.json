In 133 BC, Mysia became part of the Roman Empire within the province of Asia. For about 150 years before joining the Roman Empire, Mysia was part of the kingdom of Pergamum. The travel account in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:7-Acts16:8\">Acts 16:7â€“8</a> indicates that the apostle Paul passed through this region. This was on his second missionary journey but he did not preach there.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6835\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pergamos, Pergamum</span>.</p>",
