Basemath may be the same as Elon’s daughter Adah, or perhaps was her sister (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:2\">36:2</a>).</p><p>2. Ishmael’s daughter, who married Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:3\">Gn 36:3</a>) and bore Reuel to him (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:4,Gen36:10\">4, 10</a>). This Basemath is probably the same as Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:9\">28:9</a>). Since Ishmael was the son of the patriarch Abraham, this marriage would have been more acceptable to Isaac and Rebekah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:6-Gen36:8\">36:6–8</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6034\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mahalath (Person) #1</span>.</p><p>Identifications of #1 and #2 above are somewhat confused. Most scholars suspect that Esau married Elon’s daughter Adah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:2-Gen36:4\">Gn 36:2–4</a>), who was also called Basemath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:34\">26:34</a>). Later, Esau married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:9\">28:9</a>), who was likewise called Basemath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:3-Gen36:4\">36:3–4</a>). That two of Esau’s wives should be named Basemath could be because Esau chose to give both the same affectionate name, which means “fragrant.”</p><p>3. King Solomon’s daughter who married Ahimaaz, the king’s administrator in Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:15\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:15</a>).</p>",
