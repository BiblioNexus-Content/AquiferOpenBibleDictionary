    "content": "<h1>NIGHT HAWK</h1><p>The night hawk, also called the goatsucker, is a migratory bird that hunts insects at night. It is dark in color and has short legs. It is similar to the American whippoorwill.</p><p>Night hawks belong to the genus <em>Caprimulgus</em>. They look like owls, with flat heads, large eyes, and soft feathers. They fly quietly. During the day, they rest on branches. At night, they catch insects while flying.</p><p>The name “goatsucker” comes from an ancient belief that these birds drank milk from goats, which is not true.</p><p>The Bible lists the night hawk as an unclean bird in the law of Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:16\">Leviticus 11:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut14:15\">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>). Some scholars think the text refers to an owl. The Berean Standard Bible the word is translated &quot;screech owl.&quot; But many accept the translation “night hawk.”</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3418\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Birds</span>.</p>",
