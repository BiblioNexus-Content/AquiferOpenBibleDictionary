    "content": "<h1>PHILEMON (Person)</h1><p>Philemon was a Christian known only from the letter the apostle Paul wrote to him. The New Testament does not mention him anywhere else. </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:17\">Colossians 4:17</a> lists Archippus, a man of Colossae, along with Philemon in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:2\">Philemon 1:2</a>. Archippus may have been the son of Philemon. Although Paul had never visited Colossae, it is clear he knew Philemon well (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col2:1\">Colossians 2:1</a>). Paul called him “our beloved co-worker” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:1\">Philemon 1:1</a>). Perhaps Philemon had worked with Paul during Paul&apos;s three-year mission in Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:8-Acts19:10\">Acts 19:8–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:31\">20:31</a>). </p><p>Paul knew he could appeal to Philemon on behalf of Onesimus, who was Philemon&apos;s runaway slave. The letter to Philemon focuses on Paul&apos;s request that Philemon accept Onesimus back, not just as a slave, but as a Christian brother.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6875\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Philemon, Letter to</span>.</p>",
