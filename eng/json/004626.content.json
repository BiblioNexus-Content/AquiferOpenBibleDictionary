He was the father of Sheba and Dedan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:7\">Gn 10:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:9\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:9</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:22\">Ezekiel 27:22</a> mentions the people of Sheba and Raamah trading spices and precious stones with the merchants of Tyre. Raamah’s name was later given to a town perhaps identifiable with Ma’in in southwest Arabia.</p>",
