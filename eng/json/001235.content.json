It is mentioned in 1 and 2 Maccabees.</p><p>Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus led their army into the region of Transjordan. They captured Chaspho, along with Maked, Bosor, and other cities in Gilead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:36\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:36</a>). </p><p>Most scholars think that Chaspho is the same place called <em>Caspin</em> in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc12:13\">2&nbsp;Maccabees 12:13</a>. Some believe Chaspho was located at el-Muzeirib in the Hauran plain or at Tell el-Jamid by the Yarmuk River. But today, most scholars place it at Khisfin, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of the Sea of Galilee.</p>",
