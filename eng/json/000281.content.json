He was, therefore, David’s nephew. Amasa was a captain who supported Absalom in his rebellion against his father, David. After David&apos;s general Joab killed Absalom, David pardoned Amasa and replaced Joab with him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:13\">2&nbsp;Samuel 19:13</a>). This greatly offended Joab. He awaited his revenge. When given the opportunity, he killed his unsuspecting rival (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:4-2Sam20:13\">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:4–13</a>). David could not punish Joab but instructed his son Solomon to see that Joab was executed for murdering Amasa and another of David’s generals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6,1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:5–6, 28–34</a>).</p></li><li><p>Hadlai’s son from Ephraim’s tribe. Amasa supported the prophet Oded. Oded opposed making slaves of women and children captured from the southern kingdom of Judah in the time of King Ahaz (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:8-2Chr28:13\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 28:8–13</a>).</p></li></ol>",
