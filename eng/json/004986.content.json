    "content": "<h1>SEX, SEXUALITY</h1><h2>The Bible&apos;s Positive View of Sex and Sexuality</h2><p>Unlike some religions and philosophies, the Bible views human sexuality positively. According to the Old Testament, God made people as sexual beings. Being male or female is part of what it means to be made in the image of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28\">Genesis 1:26</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28\">28</a>). So, sexuality is an important part of who a person is<em>,</em> not just what they<em> </em>do<em>.</em></p><p>The Old Testament shows that nothing is embarrassing about the differences between male and female bodies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:25\">Genesis 2:25</a>). There is also nothing shameful about sexual activity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov5:18-Prov5:19\">Proverbs 5:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov5:18-Prov5:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl9:9\">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). In particular, the Song of Songs is a beautiful poem about love. It speaks about physical passion and should not be understood as only about spirituality.</p><p>Paul is also positive in the books of 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy. Sexual immorality was common in both Corinth and Ephesus, where these letters were sent. In response, some Christians were choosing to abstain from all sex. Marriage was being forbidden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:3</a>). Married couples stopped having sex. They believed this would make them more spiritually mature (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:5\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:5</a>).</p><p>Paul rejected these ideas. Appealing to Genesis, he reminded them to be thankful for God’s gifts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3-1Tim4:5\">1&nbsp;Timothy 4:3–5</a>). Paul wrote that husbands and wives should satisfy each other’s sexual needs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:3-1Cor7:4\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:3–4</a>).</p><p>God made sex for procreation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:28\">Genesis 1:28</a>). But sex also strengthens relationships. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:1-Gen2:25\">Genesis 2</a> describes how God made woman to provide companionship for man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:24\">2:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:24\">24</a>). Human sexuality is more than just physical intercourse. Being male or female is a way God helps us make all sorts of relationships, including some not normally thought of as sexual at all.</p><h2>The Impact of Sin on Human Sexuality</h2><p>The Bible acknowledges the negative side of human nature. After describing the goodness of sex in God&apos;s perfect plan, Genesis explains how sex, like everything else, was spoiled by sin:</p><ul><li><p>Nudity became embarrassing and scary</p></li><li><p>Men and women viewed each other as sexual objects instead of as people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:7-Gen3:10\">Genesis 3:7</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:7-Gen3:10\">10</a>)</p></li><li><p>Trust and tenderness were replaced by betrayal and harshness</p></li></ul><p>This is the root of discrimination and abuse that motivate modern feminist protests. Procreation was also spoiled as it became painful and distressing.</p><p>This is the context for the Bible’s ban on sex outside of marriage. It prohibits adultery (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:14\">Exodus 20:14</a>). It also prohibits any kind of sex outside of marriage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:18\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:3</a>). The Bible does not often explain why certain actions are forbidden. But, when it does provide reasons for banning extramarital relationships, these reasons are very informative. It does not focus on the consequences, like disease or unwanted pregnancies, or on the intentions behind the actions.</p><p>All sex outside of marriage is wrong because the body is not meant for sexual immorality and those who commit sexual sins harm their own bodies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:13,1Cor6:18\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:13, 18</a>). Sexual intercourse is a special way of communicating physically that God designed to show and confirm the unique, lifelong relationship between a man and a woman, which the Bible calls “marriage.”</p><p>The Bible prohibits homosexuality (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:22\">Leviticus 18:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:26-Rom1:27\">Romans 1:26</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:26-Rom1:27\">27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:9</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10\">10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:9-1Tim1:10\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:9-1Tim1:10\">10</a>). The only explanation for this prohibition is found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:24-Rom1:27\">Romans 1:24</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:24-Rom1:27\">27</a>. These verses suggest that God turned away from people who turned away from him by worshiping created things instead of the Creator. They abandoned God and gave in to their own sinful desires, including homosexuality. In this view, homosexuality is seen as going against the natural order God established for men and women to create life.</p><h2>Overcoming Sexual Temptation</h2><p>The Bible offers practical advice for dealing with sexual temptation: avoid it. For example, when Joseph was tempted by another man&apos;s wife, he ran away, leaving his cloak behind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen39:12\">Genesis 39:12</a>). Paul tells his Christian readers to follow Joseph’s good example (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:18\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:22\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:22</a>). This recognizes the strong desire for sex that many human beings experience, but it is not meant to be hopeless. Paul taught that the Holy Spirit gives believers the strength to overcome sexual temptation. He knew Christians who used the Spirit’s power to gain self-control and overcome their most difficult habits (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:11\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:9</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:11\">11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23\">Galatians 5:22</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23\">23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:7\">2&nbsp;Timothy 1:7</a>).</p><h2>The Future of Human Sexuality</h2><p>The New Testament hints that God will end human sexuality just as he began it. Jesus taught that there will be no marriage in heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:30\">Matthew 22:30</a>). This is an unexpected but appropriate conclusion to the Bible’s teachings on sex and sexuality. When there is no more death, the need for procreation will end. And when relationships are perfectly loving, there will not be a need for sex to strengthen them. Thus, both of God’s main purposes for human sexuality will be fully realized in eternity.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4039\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Divorce</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4403\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Family Life and Relations</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6099\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Man</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6123\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Marriage, Marriage Customs</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8186\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Virgin</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8254\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Woman</span>.</p>",
