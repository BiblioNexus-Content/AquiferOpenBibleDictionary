One of 14 cities in the lowland region of the territory allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance, listed between Azekah and Adithaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:36\">Jos 15:36</a>). Shaaraim was in the direction in which the Philistines tried to escape from the pursuing Israelites following David’s slaying of Goliath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:52\">1&nbsp;Sm 17:52</a>).</p><p>2. One of 14 cities where the sons of Shimei, a descendant of Simeon, lived until David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:31\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:31</a>). It is possibly the same city as Sharuhen (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:6\">Jos 19:6</a>), mentioned in a parallel passage, and Shilhim, located in the southern portion of Judah near Edom’s border (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:32\">15:32</a>).</p>",
