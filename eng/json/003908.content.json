Misrephoth-maim, meaning “burning of water,” defined part of the boundary of land remaining yet to be possessed by Israel during the days of Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:6\">13:6</a>). In all probability, Misrephoth-maim is identical with the cluster of springs at Khirbet el-Musheirifeh near the Mediterranean Sea, 20 miles (32.2&nbsp;kilometers) south of Sidon and 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) north of Tyre, at the base of Ras en-Nakurah.</p>",
