Abraham erected an altar under the oak of Mamre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:18\">13:18</a>). Abraham was sitting by the sacred tree when he welcomed three mysterious guests (ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:33\">18</a>). Mamre is also a possible site for the scene of Abrahamic covenant ceremonies (ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21\">15</a>). Isaac and Jacob also lived there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:27\">35:27</a>).</p>",
