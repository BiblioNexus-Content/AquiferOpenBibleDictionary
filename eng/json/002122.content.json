    "content": "<h1>GATH</h1><p>Gath was a walled city in the land of the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:6</a>). It was one of five main Philistine cities. The other cities were Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:3\">Joshua 13:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:17\">1&nbsp;Samuel 6:17</a>). These cities were located on or near the southern coast of what is now Israel and Palestine.</p><p>Gath often fought with the Israelites. But Israel did not take control of the city until the time of David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:1\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:1</a>). Gath was a Canaanite city. It was the hometown of Goliath, a giant who fought David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:4\">1&nbsp;Samuel 17:4</a>). Other very tall warriors also came from Gath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:18-2Sam21:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:18–22</a>). Some of the Anakim (a group of giants) still lived there, even after Joshua’s battles to take the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:36-Josh10:39\">Joshua 10:36–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:21-Josh11:22\">11:21–22</a>).</p><p>The Philistines once captured the ark of God. They took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, then to Gath, and finally to Ekron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:8\">1&nbsp;Samuel 5:8</a>). Many Philistines died or got tumors after taking the ark. So they sent it back to Israel. It first went to Beth-shemesh, then to Kiriath-jearim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:14\">6:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam7:1\">7:1</a>). Later, when David was running away from King Saul, he went to Gath. He pretended to be insane in front of King Achish so they would not harm him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15\">21:10–15</a>). </p><p>During Absalom’s rebellion, 600 men from Gath (called Gittites) served as soldiers in David’s army (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:18\">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:18</a>). Rehoboam, a king of Judah, made the walls of Gath stronger (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:8\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 11:8</a>). In the 800s BC, King Hazael of Syria captured Gath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:17\">2&nbsp;Kings 12:17</a>). But later, the Philistines seemed to rule it again. King Uzziah of Judah broke down the walls of Gath during his reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:6\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:6</a>). </p><p>In the 700s BC, Gath was destroyed by Sargon II of Assyria. After that, it disappeared (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos6:2\">Amos 6:2</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6881\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Philistia, Philistines</span>.</p>",
