    "content": "<h1>TAHPANHES</h1><p>Important Egyptian center in the eastern Delta. Listed with Memphis among Israel’s enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer2:16\">Jer 2:16</a>), it is the place to which Jews fled after the murder of Gedaliah in 586 BC when Jeremiah was taken to Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer43:7-Jer43:9\">43:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer44:1\">44:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer46:14\">46:14</a>). Ezekiel prophesied doom against this city (alternately spelled Tehaphnehes in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek30:18\">Ez 30:18</a>, rsv).</p><p>Today the site is identified with Tell Dephneh (Defenneh), 26 miles (41.8 kilometers) southwest of Port Said. There is little evidence of occupation here before the time of Psammetichus I (664–610 BC), who established a fortress at the site and left a garrison of Greek mercenaries. Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, where Jeremiah buried stones as a promise of Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer43:9\">Jer 43:9</a>), has been identified with the fortress of Psammetichus. A fragmentary Neo-Babylonian text of the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar refers to operations against Pharaoh Amasis and a Greek garrison.</p>",
