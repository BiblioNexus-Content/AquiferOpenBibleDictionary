The Dehavites, whom some scholars associate with the Daoi (a Persian tribe originating near the Caspian Sea), wrote to Artaxerxes to protest the rebuilding of Jerusalem by the returning Jewish exiles. Some interpreters suggest that the word translated “Dehavites” could mean “that is,” so that the phrase would read “the men of Susa, that&nbsp;is, the Elamites” (rsv).</p>",
