It seems it was near Baal-perazim, which means “Baal of Breaches.” Baal-perazim is where King David defeated the Philistines. From the context of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:20\">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:20</a>, it appears that this battleground was in the valley of Rephaim, which is southwest of Jerusalem.</p>",
