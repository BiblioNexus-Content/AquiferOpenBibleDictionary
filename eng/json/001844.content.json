Through him Paul learned of the progress of the Colossian church and thus wrote his letter to the Colossians. Paul’s high regard for Epaphras was evidenced by his use of such terms as “beloved fellow servant,” “faithful minister of Christ” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:7\">Col 1:7</a>), and “servant of Christ” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:12\">4:12</a>), a title of esteem Paul bestowed only on one other person—Timothy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:1\">Phil 1:1</a>). Epaphras was in prison with Paul at the time the letter to Philemon was written (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:23\">Phlm 1:23</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3783\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Colossians, Letter to the</span>.</p>",
