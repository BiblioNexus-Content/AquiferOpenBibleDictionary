The references to beans in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27-2Sam17:28\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:27â€“28</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek4:9\">Ezekiel 4:9</a> are generally thought to refer to the broad bean (<em>Faba vulgaris</em>). This species is an annual plant, which means it completes its life cycle in one year. The broad bean is believed to have originally grown in northern Persia, but it was widely grown as a food plant in western Asia from very early times. </p><p>Beans have been discovered in Egyptian tombs alongside mummies, showing they were important in ancient Egyptian culture. The Greeks and Romans also grew beans as a crop.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2592\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Agriculture</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4454\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Food and Food Preparation</span>.</p>",
