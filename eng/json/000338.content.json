    "content": "<h1>ANATHOTH (PLACE), ANATHOTHITE</h1><p>A town in Benjamin’s territory given to the Levites to live in (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:18\">Joshua 21:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:60\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:60</a>). Anathoth may have been named by the Canaanites for their goddess Anath or later by the Israelites for one of Benjamin’s descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:8\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:8</a>). </p><p>The town was probably located at Ras el-Karrubeh near the modern town of Anata 4.8 kilometers (three miles) north of Jerusalem. Its&nbsp;residents were sometimes called Anethothites or Anetothites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:27\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:12\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:12</a>). </p><p>One of David’s military leaders, Abiezer, was from Anathoth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:28\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:28</a>, King James Version “Antothite”). The soldier Jehu (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:3\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:3</a>) and the priest Abiathar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:26</a>) were also from Anothoth. </p><p>It was also the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer1:1\">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). Some of its <span>residents </span>violently opposed him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:21\">Jeremiah 11:21</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:23\">23</a>). Just before Judah fell to Babylon, Jeremiah bought a field in Anathoth as a sign that Israel would be restored to her land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer32:7-Jer32:9\">Jeremiah 32:7–9</a>). Years later, 128 men of Anathoth returned from the exile. They resettled the town (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:32\">Nehemiah 11:32</a>).</p>",
