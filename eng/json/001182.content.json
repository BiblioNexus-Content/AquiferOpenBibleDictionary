Paul instructed his disciple Timothy to bring the cloak when he visited him in prison (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:13\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:13</a>). It is possible that Carpus was one of the converts of Paul. According to tradition, Carpus became the bishop of Berytus (Beirut) in Thrace. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",
