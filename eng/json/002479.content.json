During the time of Abraham, it was inhabited by Amorites who were subdued by Kedorlaomer as he and other eastern kings swept through the area (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:7\">Gn 14:7</a>). It has been suggested that it may be the Tamar that Solomon fortified (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:18\">1&nbsp;Kgs 9:18</a>), placed by Ezekiel southeast of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek47:18-Ezek47:19\">Ez 47:18â€“19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:28\">48:28</a>). Wadi Hasasa has apparently been named after the ancient site.</p>",
