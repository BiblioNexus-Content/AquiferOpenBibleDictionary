He was the firstborn son of Manasseh through his Aramean concubine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:23\">Genesis 50:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:14\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:14</a>). Machir was the father of Gilead and the founder of the Machirite clan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:29\">Numbers 26:29</a>). His descendants defeated the Amorites who lived in the land of Gilead east of the Jordan River during the time of Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:39\">Numbers 32:39</a>). Later, Joshua assigned them this land along with Bashan for an inheritance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:15\">Deuteronomy 3:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh17:1-Josh17:3\">Joshua 17:1–3</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14\">Judges 5:14</a>, the whole tribe of Manasseh is called by this name.</p></li><li><p>A son of Ammiel who lived in Lo-debar. Lo-debar was a town east of the Jordan River. Machir provided shelter for Mephibosheth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam9:4-2Sam9:5\">2&nbsp;Samuel 9:4–5</a>).
