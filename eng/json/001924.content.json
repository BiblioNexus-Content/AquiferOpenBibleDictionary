Eunice was a Jewish Christian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1\">Acts 16:1</a>). She taught Timothy the Old Testament Scriptures “from infancy” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:15\">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:15</a>). Eunice converted to Christianity during the first trip of the apostle Paul to her home in Lystra. This happened sometime before his visit mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1\">Acts 16:1.</a></p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8023\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Timothy (Person)</span>.</p>",
