    "content": "<h1>SYNAGOGUE</h1><p>A synagogue is a building where Jewish people gather to worship, pray, and study their sacred writings. The transliteration of the Greek word <em>sunagoge,</em> which means &quot;a gathering together.&quot; It appears over 50 times in the New Testament, mainly referring to Jewish community gathering places in Palestine and the Diaspora (areas outside Israel where Jews lived). In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, <em>sunagoge</em> often translates Hebrew words that describe the assembly of people.</p><h2>Origins and Early History</h2><p>We are not certain exactly when synagogues first began. They may have started after the Babylonians destroyed the temple in Jerusalem in 586 BC. The people who stayed nearby wanted to continue practicing their faith. They likely felt the need to meet for worship, to teach the law, and to share the prophets&apos; messages. Some believe synagogues began in this context. </p><p>Jewish people in different areas of the Dispersion likely felt a similar need. Jewish elders met with Ezekiel while in exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1\">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek14:1\">14:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek20:1\">20:1</a>). However, there is no clear evidence of synagogues at this early time. After the exile, when the people returned to Jerusalem, Ezra the scribe read and explained God&apos;s law to the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:1-Neh8:8\">Nehemiah 8:1–8)</a>. The people listened, and when Ezra praised God, they bowed their heads to worship. These were the basic elements of synagogue worship. </p><p>The first clear evidence of a synagogue is from Egypt in the third century BC. By the first century BC, there were many synagogues in different places.</p><h2>Synagogues in New Testament Times</h2><p>The Gospels suggest that many synagogues existed throughout Palestine. Jesus often taught in synagogues (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:23\">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:35\">9:35</a>), especially during his Galilean ministry, and likely in Judea too. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:20\">John 18:20</a>, during his trial before the high priest, Jesus said, “<span>I have spoken openly to the world… I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together</span>.&quot;</p><p>The Acts of the Apostles mentions synagogues in: </p><ul><li><p>Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:9\">Acts 6:9</a>)</p></li><li><p>Damascus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:2\">Acts 9:2</a>)</p></li><li><p>Cyprus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:5\">Acts 13:5</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Roman province of Galatia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:14\">Acts 13:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:1\">14:1</a>)</p></li><li><p>Macedonia and Greece (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:1,Acts17:10,Acts17:17\">Acts 17:1, 10, 17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:4\">18:4</a>)</p></li><li><p>Ephesus in the Roman province of Asia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:8\">acts 19:8</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Paul usually went straight to the synagogue to preach as long as he was allowed.</p><h2>Synagogue Worship</h2><p>The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles show that Jewish people gathered on the Sabbath to worship in the synagogue. They also met for worship on the second and fifth days of the week. Luke gives us the earliest description of a synagogue service (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:16-Luke4:22\">Luke 4:16–22</a>). The Mishnah (a written collection of Jewish oral laws and teachings) outlines the synagogue service pattern: </p><ul><li><p>The confession of faith called the Shema was recited (which included reading <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9\">Deuteronomy 6:4–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut11:13-Deut11:21\">11:13–21</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num15:37-Num15:41\">Numbers 15:37–41</a>).</p></li><li><p>The people prayed together, including a set of special prayers called the 18 Benedictions.</p></li><li><p>The people read from Scripture. They always read from the Law (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:21\">Acts 15:21</a>). They followed a three-year schedule to read through the entire Law (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, also called the Pentateuch). They also read from the Prophets, though these readings were chosen more freely.</p></li><li><p>The people interpreted the readings. Since fewer people understood biblical Hebrew in Palestine, an Aramaic translation was given after the Hebrew reading, and a Greek translation in the Diaspora.</p></li><li><p>People would teach about the readings. After the reading, anyone qualified could speak to the people, as Jesus and the apostle Paul often did.</p></li><li><p>A blessing was given at the end of the service.</p></li></ul><h2>Legal Matters</h2><p>The synagogue also helped resolve disputes and deal with legal matters in the community. The community brought those who disobeyed the law and those acting against Jewish religion before the elders. These elders acted like local judges. In extreme cases, they could ban someone from the synagogue, which meant the person could not join in worship or community life. They could also order physical punishment, usually whipping (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:22,John9:34-John9:35\">John 9:22, 34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:42\">12:42</a>). Jesus warned his disciples to be ready for either outcome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:17\">Matthew 10:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:2\">John 16:2</a>). </p><p>Saul, who persecuted Christians, had letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus. These letters allowed him to arrest Christians and take them to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:2\">Acts 9:2</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:19\">Acts 22:19</a>, Paul mentions causing them to be beaten and imprisoned. Paul himself received the 39 lashes given in the synagogues (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:24\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:24</a>).</p><h2>Teaching the Law</h2><p>Reading the Law was very important in synagogue worship. Teaching the Law to people, especially children, was closely linked to the synagogue. They used either the synagogue building or a school for this purpose.</p><h2>Leadership</h2><p>The New Testament specifically mentions two roles in the synagogue: </p><ul><li><p>The &quot;ruler of the synagogue&quot;</p></li><li><p>An attendant</p></li></ul><p>The ruler of the synagogue maintained order and chose the Scripture reader (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:22\">Mark 5:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:14\">Luke 13:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:8\">Acts 18:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:17\">17</a>). The attendant managed the Scripture scrolls and disciplined students who misbehaved (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:20\">Luke 4:20</a>). Later, a person was appointed to lead prayers.</p><h2>Building Design</h2><p>The synagogue&apos;s structure was similar to the temple. It was often built on high ground and constructed so that the people could sit facing the direction of Jerusalem. There was a portable chest for the scrolls of the Law and the Prophets, and a platform for reading Scriptures and preaching. Men and women sat separately. The scribes preferred the &quot;chief seats&quot; facing the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:39\">Mark 12:39</a>). Many synagogues featured decorations like vine leaves, seven-branched candlesticks, the paschal lamb, and the pot of manna. Early synagogues also had a genizah, which was a cellar or attic. They stored worn scrolls here, as these scrolls were too sacred to destroy because they had the name of God written on them.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5646\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judaism</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7239\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Ruler of the Synagogue</span>.</p>",
