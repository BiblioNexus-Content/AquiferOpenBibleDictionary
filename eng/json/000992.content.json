The Greek OT, called the Septuagint, has “and her daughters,” which would mean that this was not a specific place but rather the cluster of villages surrounding Hazar-shual and Beersheba. Such a translation is possible with a slight adjustment to the Hebrew text. It is difficult to say how the Hebrew text originally read.</p>",
