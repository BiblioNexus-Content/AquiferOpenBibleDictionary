People in ancient times used it like a type of glue or sealant.</p><p>Bitumen (or tar) was used for mortar when building the Tower of Babel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:3\">Genesis 11:3</a>). It was also used to seal the reed basket in which baby Moses was hidden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:3\">Exodus 2:3</a>). In Israel, the valley of Siddim had many bitumen pits. Some soldiers fell into them during Chedorlaomer&apos;s war against Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:10\">Genesis 14:10</a>).</p><p>Bitumen is translated as “slime” in the King James Version.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2996\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Asphalt</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6313\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Minerals and Metals</span>.</p>",
