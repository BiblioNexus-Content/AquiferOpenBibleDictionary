The word means “married” and was used symbolically by the prophet Isaiah to describe what God’s special relationship would be to his restored people. The same theme recurs in New Testament references to the “Bride of Christ.”</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3507\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bride of Christ</span>.</p>",
