It might be the same spring by which Saul and his army set up their tents before their battle with the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 29:1</a>). The spring of Harod is at â€˜Ain Jalud by the northern side of Mt Gilboa. This is about 3.2&nbsp;kilometers (two miles) southeast of Zerin.</p></li><li><p>Home of Shammah and Elika, two of the mighty men of King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:25\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:25</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:27</a>, Elika&apos;s name is not included, and Shammoth (also called Shammah) is listed as a Harorite instead of a Harodite.
