    "content": "<h1>CIVIL LAW AND JUSTICE</h1><p>Civil law deals with private disputes between individuals, such as those about debt, divorce, inheritance, or other relationships. Criminal law, on the other hand, deals with crimes like murder, treason, or theft. In civil cases, the guilty party must compensate the victim appropriately.</p><p>This distinction between civil and criminal law is very different from biblical thinking. Almost all offenses were handled by private prosecution. If someone was murdered, their relatives were responsible for killing the murderer or chasing him to the nearest city of refuge for a trial. </p><p>In Israel, all offenses had a religious dimension: theft or adultery was not only an offense against a neighbor but also a sin against God. This meant that every Israelite would be shocked by such behavior and would want it punished. If these acts continued, God might step in to punish the individual, their family, or even the whole nation. This religious aspect made every offense seem like a crime, even though most prosecutions were left to individuals.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3837\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Courts and Trials</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3861\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Criminal Law and Punishment</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4009\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Dietary Laws</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4039\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Divorce</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4038\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Divorce, Certificate of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4794\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hammurabi, Law Code of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5864\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Law, Biblical Concept of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5901\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Leviticus, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6123\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Marriage, Marriage Customs</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3786\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Commandments, The Ten</span>.</p>",
