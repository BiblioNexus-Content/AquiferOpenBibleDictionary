It was later captured by Geshur and Aram (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:23\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:23</a>). </p><p>Kenath was a Canaanite city. It appears in Egyptian curse texts from the 19th and 18th centuries BC. The city was also conquered by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III and is mentioned in the Amarna letters (ancient diplomatic correspondence).. </p><p>During the Hellenistic period (the time after Alexander the Great), Kenath became one of the cities of the Decapolis (a group of ten cities). Jewish people who returned from exile in Babylon settled there. The Jewish religious teachers (rabbis) considered it a border town of the promised land. Kenath was also called Kanatha.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5687\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Kanatha</span>.</p>",
