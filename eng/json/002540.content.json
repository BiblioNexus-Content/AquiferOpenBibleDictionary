Lotan’s son, the brother of Hori and a descendant of Seir the Horite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:22\">Gn 36:22</a>); alternately spelled Homam in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:39\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:39</a>, reflecting a later scribal error.</p><p>2. Mahol’s son, descendant of Zerah from Judah’s tribe and one of the sages whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon’s (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6\">1&nbsp;Chr 2:6</a>). He is perhaps the Ezrahite and author of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps88:1-Ps88:18\">Psalm 88</a>.</p><p>3. Kohathite Levite, Joel’s son and one appointed, along with Asaph and Ethan (also called Jeduthun), by David to lead the musicians in the sanctuary (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:33\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17\">15:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:41\">16:41</a>). During the transport of the ark from Obed-edom’s house to Jerusalem, he was responsible for sounding the bronze cymbals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:19\">1&nbsp;Chr 15:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12\">2&nbsp;Chr 5:12</a>). Heman fathered 14 sons and 3 daughters, all of whom served as musicians in the Lord’s house (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:6\">1&nbsp;Chr 25:1–6</a>). Later, his descendants participated in the cleansing of the temple during King Hezekiah’s reign (715–686 BC; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14\">2&nbsp;Chr 29:14</a>) and assisted with the Passover celebration initiated by King Josiah (640–609 BC; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr35:15\">2&nbsp;Chr 35:15</a>).</p>",
