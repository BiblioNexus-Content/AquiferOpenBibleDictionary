In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:2\">Romans 16:1–2</a>, Paul commended Phoebe to the recipients of the letter on the basis of her valuable service to other Christians. He asked that they give her whatever assistance she needed.</p><p>The term “deacon” is applied to Phoebe. It probably designates an official position in the church, as in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil1:1\">Philippians 1:1</a>, although it may mean “minister” in the same sense that Paul uses it elsewhere of himself and others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:5\">1&nbsp;Cor 3:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:6\">2&nbsp;Cor 3:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4\">6:4</a>).</p>",
