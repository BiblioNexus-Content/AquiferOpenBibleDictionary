    "content": "<h1>LAZARUS</h1><ol><li><p>Lazarus the beggar. In one of Jesus&apos;s well-known parables (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">Luke 16:19–31</a>), he compared the earthly lives of a beggar named Lazarus and a rich man who is not named. The rich man is often called &quot;Dives&quot; in English, a name that comes from the Latin word for &quot;rich.&quot; The rich man enjoyed a life of luxury but ignored Lazarus, a blind beggar with sores, who lay at his gate.  Jesus said that when Lazarus died, he went to be with Abraham, while Dives suffered eternal torment.</p><p>Sometimes people have misunderstood this parable as condemning wealth. However, it is actually a warning against enjoying wealth without caring for the poor. The parable teaches that the choices we make in this life affect our eternal destiny.</p><p>In no other parable did Jesus give a character a specific name. Because of this, some Bible scholars believe that Jesus might have been telling a true story. However, the name &quot;Lazarus&quot; might have been chosen for its meaning, as it refers to someone &quot;whom God helped.&quot; In the Middle Ages, people honored the beggar Lazarus as the patron saint of those suffering from leprosy. Hospitals for lepers were called &quot;lazar-houses.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Lazarus of Bethany. Jesus performed one of his most amazing miracles when he brought Lazarus of Bethany back to life four days after he had died. Lazarus lived with his two sisters, Mary and Martha. They were among Jesus&apos;s closest friends (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:3-John11:5\">John 11:3–5, 36</a>). Jesus visited their home several times, and it became his place to stay during his final week on earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:17\">Matthew 21:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42\">Luke 10:38–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:1-John12:11\">John 11:1–12:11</a>). Lazarus was present at a banquet held in Jesus&apos;s honor, where Mary anointed Jesus&apos;s feet with expensive perfume (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:3\">John 12:1–3</a>).</p><p>The raising of Lazarus is the most detailed of Jesus&apos;s miracles in the Gospel of John. It had three important results:</p><ol><li><p> Many Jews in the area around Jerusalem believed in Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:45\">John 11:45</a>) and later welcomed him into the city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:17-John12:18\">John 12:17–18</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Jewish leaders, who had already rejected Jesus, decided that he must be put to death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:53\">John 11:53</a>)</p></li><li><p>These leaders also planned to kill Lazarus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:10-John12:11\">John 12:10–11</a>)</p></li></ol><p>This miracle not only showed Jesus&apos;s power over death but also prepared the way for his own resurrection.</p></li></ol>",
