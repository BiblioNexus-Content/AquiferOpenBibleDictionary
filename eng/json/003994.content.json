    "content": "<h1>MUTENESS</h1><p>The inability to speak. Muteness (also called aphasia by doctors) can last for a short time or be permanent. It may happen because of mental disability, brain damage, or being unable to hear.</p><p>The Bible records several examples of muteness. Zechariah was made mute by the angel Gabriel because he did not believe he would become the father of John the Baptist (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:18-Luke1:22\">Luke 1:18–22</a>). That condition lasted at least nine months until the baby was born and named (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:62-Luke1:64\">Luke 1:62–64</a>).</p><p>Not being able to speak is usually associated with brain diseases or when the brain is not formed correctly. Jesus healed people who could not speak and people who could not hear (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:33\">Matthew 9:32–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:22-Matt12:23\">12:22–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:30-Matt15:31\">15:30–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:32-Mark7:37\">Mark 7:32–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:17-Mark9:27\">9:17–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:14\">Luke 11:14</a>). When he did this, people were amazed.</p><p>Other passages of the Bible talk about muteness in people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov31:8\">Proverbs 31:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa35:6\">Isaiah 35:6</a>) and in animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa56:10\">Isaiah 56:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:16\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:16</a>). The prophets often argued false gods and idols cannot speak (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:18-Hab2:20\">Hebrews 2:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor12:2\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:2</a>). The prophets contrasted these gods with the living and speaking God of Israel.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
