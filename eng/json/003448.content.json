    "content": "<h1>LEBANON</h1><p>Region mentioned only in the OT, although its towns, including Tyre and Sidon, are named in the NT. The name Lebanon generally refers to the double range of mountains that commences near Tyre and runs northeast following the Mediterranean coast. The two Lebanon ranges are parallel to one another, Lebanon to the west and Anti-Lebanon to the east. The name Lebanon is derived from the Hebrew root l-b-n<em>,</em> meaning “white,” which may reflect either the white limestone of the mountains or the snow that lay on the mountains for six months of the year (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:14\">Jer 18:14</a>).</p><h2>Geography</h2><p>At the southern end the Lebanon ranges are a direct continuation of the hills of northern Galilee, with Mt Hermon (Sirion, Senir) very prominent in the Anti-Lebanon range, rising to 9,230 feet (2,813.3 meters). The two ranges are divided by a broad valley, the valley of Lebanon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:17\">Jos 11:17</a>) or “the entrance of Hamath” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:8\">Nm 34:8</a>), the modern Beqa’a.</p><p>In the south the Lebanon range is separated from the Galilee hills by a deep east-west gorge through which the Litani River flows, entering the Mediterranean just north of Tyre. In its upper courses it follows the Beqa’a Valley in a northeasterly direction almost to Baalbek. The Lebanon ridge, about 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) long, stretches north to the east-west valley of the Nahr el-Kebir and is marked by a series of peaks. In the south are&nbsp;Gebel Rihan, Tomat, and Gebel Niha (ranging from 5,350 feet to nearly 6,230 feet, or 1,636.7 to 1,898.9 meters, high) east of Sidon. In the center lie Gebel Baruk, Gebel Kuneiyiseh, and Gebel Sunnin (7,220 feet, 6,890 feet, and 8,530 feet high, or 2,200.7 meters, 2,100.1 meters, and 2,599.9 meters high, respectively) east of Beirut. Further north, to the east of Tripoli, lies Qurnet es-Sauda, which reaches 9,840 feet (2,999.2 meters), and Qurnet Aruba, about 7,320 feet (2,231.1 meters) high.</p><p>These high mountains trap the rain coming from the Mediterranean, providing both the mountain areas and the coastal strip below with good rainfall; beyond the mountains, the rainfall drops. It is along the coastal strip between the mountains and the sea that the Phoenicians flourished and towns like Tyre, Zarephath, Sidon, Berytus (Beirut), Byblos (Gebal), and Tripoli were established. The coastal area has a number of headlands that are extensions of the mountain range. The coastal road had to be cut around or through these spurs. A good example is the headland of Nahr el-Kelb, a little to the north of Beirut.</p><p>On the east side of the Lebanon range is the Beqa’a Valley. The Orontes River rises in the north of this valley and flows north to enter the Mediterranean north of ancient Ugarit. This whole valley region was known in classical literature as Coele-syria (Hollow Syria). It was the “breadbasket” of the Romans.</p><p>To the east of the Beqa’a Valley is the Anti-Lebanon range, in which the Barada River rises and flows east toward the fertile oasis of Damascus. Mt Hermon, in the southern part of the range, was known as Sirion by the Phoenicians and Senir by the Amorites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:9\">Dt 3:9</a>).</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Lebanon was famous in antiquity for its rich forests of fir and cedar. The coastal areas, the Beqa’a Valley, and the lower slopes of the mountains were suitable for olive trees, fruit trees, and vineyards, as well as some grain crops. One important product came from the sea: a mollusk of the gastropoda class from which a red or purple dye was obtained. The name “Phoenician” derived from the Greek phoinos<em>,</em> red-purple. Wool dyed purple was available in Ugarit about 1500 BC. The Phoenicians had a monopoly on this industry for centuries. The people of Israel, who used a great deal of purple dye in their tabernacle furnishings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod26:1-Exod26:37\">Ex 26</a>) and the garments of their priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:4-Exod28:6\">Ex 28:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod39:1,Exod39:28-Exod39:29\">39:1, 28–29</a>), probably obtained the dye from the Phoenicians.</p><p>King Solomon had significant trading relations with Phoenicia. To build the temple in Jerusalem, cedar and fir were obtained from Hiram I of Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:6,1Kgs5:9,1Kgs5:14\">1&nbsp;Kgs 5:6, 9, 14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:2\">7:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:17,1Kgs10:21\">10:17, 21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8,2Chr2:16\">2&nbsp;Chr 2:8, 16</a>). Solomon paid for this timber in wheat and olive oil (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:11\">1&nbsp;Kgs 5:11</a>). The trees were floated down by sea to a point in Solomon’s domain and transported from there to Jerusalem. Cedar and fir trees from Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon provided ships for Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:5\">Ez 27:5</a>), sacred barges and furniture for Egypt, and timber for building the second temple in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:7\">Ezr 3:7</a>).</p><p>From the ports of Lebanon, the Phoenicians traded with many lands. They mastered the art of shipbuilding, and their ships were used in peace and in war. A vivid picture of the trading activities of traders from Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, and Arvad is given in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:1-Ezek27:36\">Ezekiel 27</a>, where the extent and nature of their trade is given in considerable detail.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The area became of interest to the Egyptians during the fourth dynasty (c. 2600 BC) when Pharaoh Snofru acquired 40 shiploads of cedar from Lebanon. Byblos fell under Egyptian influence during the 12th dynasty (c. 1980–1800 BC) and Egyptians gave golden ornaments in exchange for cedar. During the 18th dynasty (c. 1552–1306 BC), Egypt conquered Syria, and the records speak regularly of cedar being taken as tribute. Later an envoy of Ramses XI named Wenamon paid dearly for the cedar (c. 1100 BC).</p><p>When Egyptian power waned, the Assyrians controlled the area and took vast quantities of cedar as tribute from&nbsp;the days of Tiglath-pileser I (c. 1100 BC) onward. Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian nation likewise controlled Lebanon and took away large quantities of cedar to build temples and palaces. The spoiling of Lebanon’s forests was spoken of by Isaiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:8\">Is 14:8</a>) and Habakkuk (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:17\">Hb 2:17</a>). In later centuries Lebanon passed successively under the domination of Persians, Greeks, and Romans.</p><p>In NT times the towns of Tyre and Sidon are generally coupled together (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:21\">Mt 15:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:8\">Mk 3:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:24,Mark7:31\">7:24, 31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:17\">Lk 6:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:13-Luke10:14\">10:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:20\">Acts 12:20</a>), though sometimes they are referred to alone (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts21:3,Acts21:7\">Acts 21:3, 7</a>). A Greek woman who was a Syro-Phoenician is referred to in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:26\">Mark 7:26</a>. Jesus preached in these areas during his ministry. In biblical poetry the tall cedars of Lebanon were a symbol of majesty and strength (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:15\">Jgs 9:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:9\">2&nbsp;Kgs 14:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps92:12\">Pss 92:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:16\">104:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa35:2\">Is 35:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:13\">60:13</a>). They were also a symbol of earthly pride that would be broken before the wrath of God one day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps29:5\">Ps 29:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa2:13\">Is 2:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:34\">10:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer22:6\">Jer 22:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek31:3\">Ez 31:3</a>).</p>",
