    "content": "<h1>ZEBULUN, Tribe of</h1><p>A tribe descended from Zebulun, Jacob&apos;s tenth son and Leah&apos;s sixth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:19-Gen30:20\">Genesis 30:19</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:19-Gen30:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:19-Gen30:20\">20</a>). Zebulun&apos;s tribe was split into three clans named after his sons: the Seredites, Elonites, and Jahleelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen46:14\">Genesis 46:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:27\">Numbers 26:27</a>). During the census on the plains of Moab, the tribe had 60,500 men over 20 years old who were fit for military service (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:26-Num26:27\">Numbers 26:26</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:26-Num26:27\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:26-Num26:27\">27</a>).</p><h2>Land and Territory</h2><p>Zebulun&apos;s land was in central Canaan and included the Jezreel Valley. However, the exact boundaries are hard to pinpoint because only the southeastern and eastern borders are mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:16\">Joshua 19:10</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:16\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:16\">16</a>. The western border along the Mediterranean is not clearly defined. Moses&apos;s blessing suggests that Zebulun, with Issachar, would “<span>feast on the abundance of the seas</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:18-Deut33:19\">Deuteronomy 33:18–19</a>). This implies access to the Mediterranean and its trade </p><p>Despite this, Zebulun&apos;s territory does not seem to touch the sea, which appears to contradict <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:13\">Genesis 49:13</a>. However, Zebulun was in a good location along major trade routes to the sea. This allowed them to benefit from trade by sea, even if they were not directly on the coast. The land of Zebulun was good for growing crops and produced olive groves, vineyards, and plentiful harvests. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:40\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:40</a>, the tribe provided generous supplies for David.</p><h2>Military Strength</h2><p>Zebulun maintained a strong position among its neighbors. Unlike Asher and Naphtali, which lived among the Canaanites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:32-Judg1:33\">Judges 1:32</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:32-Judg1:33\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:32-Judg1:33\">33</a>), Zebulun had fewer Canaanites in their area. During the period of the judges, Zebulun was very active. For instance, Zebulun and Naphtali soldiers were key in the victory at the battle of Kishon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:6-Judg4:10\">Judges 4:6</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:6-Judg4:10\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:6-Judg4:10\">10</a>). The Song of Deborah praises Zebulun for risking their lives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:18\">Judges 5:18</a>). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:35\">Judges 6:35</a>, the men of Zebulun fought bravely in Gideon’s struggle with the Midianites on the plain of Jezreel. Judge Elon belonged to the tribe of Zebulun (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:11-Judg12:12\">Judges 12:11</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:11-Judg12:12\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg12:11-Judg12:12\">12</a>).  Since Galilee was in the territory of Zebulun, Ibzan of Bethlehem was probably also from Zebulun (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:15\">Joshua 19:15</a>). Zebulun’s fighting force was among the largest in David&apos;s western armies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr12:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 12:33</a>). This is another sign that Zebulun&apos;s tribe was both strong and important.</p><h2>Zebulun in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, Zebulun is mentioned twice. It is noted as a region where Jesus, described as a great light, appeared (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:13-Matt4:15\">Matthew 4:13</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:13-Matt4:15\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:13-Matt4:15\">15</a>). Zebulun is also listed among the 12 tribes in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:8\">Revelation 7:8</a> after Issachar.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8331\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Zebulun (Person)</span>.</p>",
