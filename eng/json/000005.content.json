    "content": "<h1>ABADDON</h1><p>A Hebrew word that means “place of destruction.” It appears six times in the Old Testament, usually referring to the place where people go after they die (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job26:6\">Job 26:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job28:22\">28:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:12\">31:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps88:11\">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov15:11\">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov27:20\">27:20</a>). </p><p>Abaddon means the same thing as Sheol (the underworld or realm of the dead). Some Bible translations use words like “hell,” “death,” “the grave,” or “destruction” instead of Abaddon.</p><p>The same Hebrew word appears once in the New Testament in its Greek form, Apollyon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev9:11\">Revelation 9:11</a>). In this verse, the idea of destruction is shown as a person called the “angel of the Abyss [the bottomless pit].” Because of this, some translations use the word “destroyer” instead of Abaddon.</p><p>In the book of Revelation, John has a vision where Abaddon (or Apollyon) is described as the angel ruling over the place of the dead. This angel appears after the fifth trumpet sounds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev9:1\">Revelation 9:1</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7529\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Sheol</span>.</p>",
