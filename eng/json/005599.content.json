Joshua rebuilt the city and settled there. When Joshua died, he was buried on the property located in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:30\">Jos 24:30</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:9\">Judges 2:9</a> gives the same location, but the name is Timnath-heres (see nlt mg), which means “territory [or portion] of the sun.” This seems to indicate that the city used to be a place for sun worship.</p>",
