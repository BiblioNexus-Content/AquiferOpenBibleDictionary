    "content": "<h1>ARVAD, ARVADITE</h1><p>A small, fortified island about 3.2&nbsp;kilometers (2&nbsp;miles) off the coast of Syria (ancient Phoenicia). It is about 48 kilometers (30 miles) north of Tripolis. Arvad developed a large trading and fighting fleet (a group of ships). A description of the naval power of Tyre refers to the fame of Arvadite sailors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:8,Ezek27:11\">Ezra 27:8, 11</a>). </p><p>Egyptian records document Arvadâ€™s fall to Thutmose III about 1472 BC. Assyrian records point to the importance of Arvad and its recurrent conquest by foreign powers from the 11th to the 7th centuries BC.</p><p>Arvad was later known as Aradus or Arados, and is referred to by that name in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:23\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:23</a>. During the Persian and Hellenistic periods it was an important Mediterranean seaport, only to decline again. The Canaanite tribe of Arvadites possibly had an ethnic connection with the island Arvad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:18\">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:16</a>). Arwad is the modern-day name for the island.</p>",
