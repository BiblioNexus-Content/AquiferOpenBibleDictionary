Even if someone has sores from head to toe, there will still be normal skin between each sore.</p><p>The word “sore” can describe many kinds of skin problems. These include scall, scab, swelling, emerod (a painful swelling), plague (a serious skin disease), and scar.</p><p>The King James Version also uses “sore” in a nonmedical way to mean “very” or “extremely.” For example, “Hezekiah wept sore” means “Hezekiah wept very much” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:3\">2&nbsp;Kings 20:3</a>) or “sore afraid” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:35\">Ezekiel 27:35</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
