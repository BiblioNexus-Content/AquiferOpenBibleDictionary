The name &quot;Kain&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;spear,&quot; which suggests they may have been skilled in making metal tools and weapons. The tribe lived as nomads, moving from place to place rather than settling in one area. They were friendly toward Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:6\">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:6</a>). They later became part of Judah. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5718\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Kenites</span>.</p>",
