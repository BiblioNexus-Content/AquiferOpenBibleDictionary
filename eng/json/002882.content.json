    "content": "<h1>JAAR</h1><p><em>Jaar</em> is the most common Hebrew word for “forest.” It refers to forests generally (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:18\">Isaiah 10:18</a>). It also refers to specific forests, such as the “forest of Ephraim” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:6\">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:6</a>) and the “forest of Hereth” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:5\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:5</a>). Both of these forests are connected to King David&apos;s story.</p><p>The word <em>jaar</em> also appears in the name of one of King Solomon&apos;s buildings called “the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:2\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:2</a>). This building seems to have gotten its name because it used a lot of cedar wood in its construction.</p><p>Only one mention of “Jaar” seems to be a proper name. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps132:6\">Psalm 132:6</a>, there is a reference to moving the ark of the covenant from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem. In this verse, the place is called &quot;the field of Jaar&quot; (or “the wood” in the King James Version). This might be a shortened poetic way of referring to Kiriath-jearim.</p>",
