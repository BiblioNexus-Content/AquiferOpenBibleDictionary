It was mentioned in connection with the crowning of Abimelech (son of Gideon) as king there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:6,Judg9:20\">Judges 9:6, 20</a>). Since the word “millo” probably means “mount” or “earthwork,” Beth-millo is often identified with the “tower of Shechem” mentioned later in the same chapter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49\">Judges 9:46</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49\">49</a>).</p>",
