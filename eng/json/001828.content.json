    "content": "<h1>EN-GEDI</h1><p>En-gedi is an important oasis on the west side of the Dead Sea, about 56.3&nbsp;kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Jerusalem. It was part of the land given to the tribe of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:62\">Joshua 15:62</a>). En-gedi had a hot water spring flowing from a limestone cliff. It created plants that thrived in warm climates. The area became known for its palms, vineyards, and balsam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:14\">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>; Josephus’s <em>Antiquities</em> 20.1.2). The ancient site was southeast of the oasis at Tell el-Jarn near modern ’Ain Jidi.</p><p>En-gedi was also called Hazazon-tamar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:2\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:2</a>). It appears in several Old Testament stories:</p><ul><li><p>Chedorlaomer conquered the Amorites there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:7\">Genesis 14:7</a>)</p></li><li><p>David hid from Saul in the caves of En-gedi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:29\">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:29</a>)</p></li><li><p>In Ezekiel’s vision of a restored Israel, fishermen catch fish from the Dead Sea between En-gedi and En-eglaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek47:10\">Ezekiel 47:10</a>)</p></li></ul>",
