    "content": "<h1>BAAL-PERAZIM</h1><p>A location near Jerusalem where a battle was fought between Israel’s newly anointed King David and the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:20\">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr14:11\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:11</a>). David named the area Baal-perazim to remember the Lord’s “breaking through” his enemies, since the phrase means the “lord of breaking through.” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa28:21\">Isaiah 28:21 </a>references Mount Perazim, where the Lord came “suddenly and in anger.” This may recall David’s battle with the Philistines.</p>",
