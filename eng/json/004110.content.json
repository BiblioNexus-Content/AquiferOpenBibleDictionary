    "content": "<h1>NET</h1><p>A net is a tool made of ropes or cords tied together to form a mesh (many open squares or holes). People used nets mostly for catching fish.</p><p>In Bible times, fishermen often used two kinds of nets. One kind was thrown by hand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:18\">Matthew 4:18</a>). The other kind was pulled between boats or dragged through the water (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:6\">John 21:6</a>).</p><p>Nets were also used as a picture of danger or judgment. For example, the Bible says evil people will be caught in their own nets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl9:12\">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek12:13\">Ezekiel 12:13</a>). This means they will be trapped by their own plans.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4437\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Fishermen</span>.</p>",
