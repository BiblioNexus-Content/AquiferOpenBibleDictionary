This concept is similar to the term “sanctuary.” In ancient times, people would often run to altars or temples for protection. For example, Adonijah and Joab sought sanctuary from King Solomon at the altar of the tabernacle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:50</a>–<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53\">53;</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:31\"> 2:28–31</a>). In the law of Moses, asylum was given through cities of refuge. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3738\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of Refuge</span>.</p>",
