When Caleb gave her and her land as a present, Achsah asked for a water source and was given the upper springs and the lower springs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:19\">Jos 15:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:15\">Jgs 1:15</a>).</p><p>Later, Othniel delivered the Israelites from the oppressive Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia (Aram-naharaim), whom the Israelites had served for eight years on account of their sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:7\">Jgs 3:7</a>). When the people cried for relief, the Lord raised up Othniel. Delivering them, he was described as someone that the “Spirit of the Lord came upon” (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:10\">10</a>). The effects of his work as judge lasted for a generation (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:9-Judg3:11\">9–11</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5658\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judges, Book of</span>.</p>",
