Before the Israelites entered into the land of Canaan, they made camp in a valley across from Beth-peor. The people gathered to hear Moses’ final message after he had seen the land from the top of Mount Pisgah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:29\">Deuteronomy 3:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:46\">4:46</a>). Moses was buried here after he was forbidden to enter the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:6\">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>). Baal-peor (or Baal of Peor) was the name of a local deity worshiped in this area (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5\">Numbers 25:3</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5\">5</a>).</p>",
