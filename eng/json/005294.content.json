There were five cities located in the valley of Siddim:</p><ol><li><p>Sodom</p></li><li><p>Gomorrah</p></li><li><p>Admah</p></li><li><p>Zeboiim</p></li><li><p>Bela or Zoar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:2\">Genesis 14:2</a>)</p></li></ol><h2>Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible</h2><p>The valley of Siddim is near the Salt Sea. Of these cities, Sodom is mentioned most often in Genesis. It is mentioned 36 times, with 16 of those references to Sodom alone. The Bible made Sodom a famous example of a wicked city. Its destruction (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:24\">Genesis 19:24</a>) was used as a warning of God’s judgment in other biblical writings:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:23\">Deuteronomy 29:23</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:9-Isa1:10\">Isaiah 1:9</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:9-Isa1:10\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:9-Isa1:10\">10</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:14\">Jeremiah 23:14</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer49:18\">Jeremiah 49:18</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lam4:6\">Lamentations 4:6</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos4:11\">Amos 4:11</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:9\">Zephaniah 2:9</a> </p></li></ul><p>The story of Sodom’s destruction is also referenced in the New Testament: </p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:15\">Matthew 10:15</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:12\">Luke 10:12</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:29\">Luke 17:29</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:29\">Romans 9:29</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:6\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:6</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:7\">Jude 1:7</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev11:8\">Revelation 11:8</a></p></li></ul><h2>What Happened to Sodom and Gomorrah?</h2><p>The main story of Sodom and Gomorrah occurs in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:33\">Genesis 18</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:38\">19</a>. The biblical interest in the city begins in chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:1-Gen13:18\">13</a>. Lot, Abraham’s nephew, decides to settle in the Jordan Valley, near Sodom, among people who were known to be great sinners. One of the worst sins of Sodom was sexual perversion, especially homosexuality. Lot’s offer of his virgin daughters to the men of Sodom to protect his heavenly visitors shows the city&apos;s corrupting influence.</p><p>After Lot settled in Sodom, four Eastern kings attacked the region, including Sodom and Gomorrah, and took control. They returned 14 years later to stop a rebellion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1-Gen14:5\">Genesis 14:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1-Gen14:5\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1-Gen14:5\">5</a>). Lot was captured during this conflict but was later rescued by Abraham. The wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah was so great that the Lord decided to destroy them. Abraham pleaded for mercy. He asked God to spare the cities if ten righteous men could be found (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:20-Gen18:33\">Genesis 18:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:20-Gen18:33\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:20-Gen18:33\">33</a>). </p><p>The two heavenly visitors who went from Abraham to Sodom found Lot sitting at the city gate (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:1\">Genesis 19:1</a>). They told Lot about God’s plan and urged him, his wife, and his two daughters to escape the city. The Lord then rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah. The next morning, Abraham saw smoke rising from the destroyed cities like the smoke of a furnace.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3739\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of the Plain</span>.</p>",
