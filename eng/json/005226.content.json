Originating in China, silk may have been introduced into Palestine as early as Solomon’s reign (970–930 BC), or perhaps not until the conquests of Alexander the Great (336–323 BC). A fine silken fabric was apparently included in the fashionable attire of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek16:10-Ezek16:13\">Ez 16:10–13</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev18:12\">Revelation 18:12</a> lists silk as a valuable trade commodity of Babylon (Rome).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3766\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cloth and Cloth Manufacturing</span>.</p>",
