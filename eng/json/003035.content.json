    "content": "<h1>JEHOVAH-TSIDKENU</h1><p>A special name that means “The Lord (Yahweh or Jehovah) is our righteousness.” This name was given to a future righteous king that God promised would come from King David&apos;s family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6\">Jeremiah 23:5–6</a>). This same name was also used to describe the people who would live under this king&apos;s rule (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer33:16\">33:16</a>). Christians believe this promise came true when Jesus Christ came. They believe Jesus is the Lord who rules over everything and helps his followers live in a right relationship with God.</p>",
