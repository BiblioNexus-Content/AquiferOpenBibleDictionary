    "content": "<h1>OFFEND, OFFENSE</h1><p>The words &quot;offend&quot; and &quot;offense&quot; are used in two main ways in the Bible:</p><ol><li><p>Doing something wrong oneself</p></li><li><p>Causing someone else to do wrong or to make a mistake in their faith</p></li></ol><h2>Doing Wrong</h2><p>In both the Old Testament Hebrew and the New Testament Greek, there are many words for sin or wrongdoing. When we use the words &quot;offend&quot; or &quot;offense,&quot; we focus on sin against a person or the law, which means an offense against either God or people.</p><p>Sin is mainly an offense against God. For example, the people of Edom offended God by taking revenge on Judah, so God judged them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:12-Ezek25:13\">Ezekiel 25:12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:12-Ezek25:13\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:12-Ezek25:13\">13</a>). Israel offended God by worshipping Baal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos13:1\">Hosea 13:1</a>). Breaking God&apos;s law is called an offense committed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut19:15\">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut22:26\">22:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:2\">25:2</a>). In the New Testament, James talks about offenses against God and God&apos;s law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:10\">James 2:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas3:2\">3:2</a>).</p><p>The Bible also talks about offenses between people. For example, Abraham offended Abimelech (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen20:9\">Genesis 20:9</a>). Pharaoh&apos;s chief butler and baker offended their master (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen40:1\">Genesis 40:1</a>). Sometimes, the offense is only alleged, and no real wrong was done (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:36\">Genesis 31:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:14\">2&nbsp;Kings 18:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer37:18\">Jeremiah 37:18</a>). Paul, defending himself before the Roman governor Festus, said, “<span>I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts25:8\">Acts 25:8</a>).</p><p>The Bible also teaches how to handle real offenses against God and people. Offenses should be acknowledged and confessed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos5:15\">Hosea 5:15</a>). A proper resolution before God is, “<span>I will offend no more</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job34:31\">Job 34:31</a>). We need to make amends for offenses and forgive others&apos; offenses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl10:4\">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov17:9\">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov19:11\">19:11</a>). Jesus Christ died for our offenses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:25\">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:15-Rom5:21\">5:15–21</a>). By turning to Jesus, there is forgiveness for all sins.</p><h2>Causing Another to Sin</h2><p>The words &quot;offense&quot; and &quot;offend&quot; also mean causing someone else to stumble or do wrong. There are three ways this can happen:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Personal Cause</strong>: Something within a person might cause them to stumble. Jesus emphasized the seriousness of this and suggested taking extreme measures to prevent it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:29-Matt5:30\">Matthew 5:29</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:29-Matt5:30\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:29-Matt5:30\">30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:8-Matt18:9\">18:8</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:8-Matt18:9\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:8-Matt18:9\">9</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Causing Others to Stumble</strong>: Something in a person&apos;s actions might cause others to stumble. Jesus warned, “<span>Woe to the world for the causes of sin. These stumbling blocks must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:7\">Matthew 18:7</a>). The New Testament teaches that we should live in a way that does not cause others to stumble (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:13\">Romans 14:13</a>). The apostle Paul says, “Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:20-Rom14:21\">Romans 14:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:20-Rom14:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:20-Rom14:21\">21</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:32\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:3\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:3</a>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Offense at the Truth</strong>: People may be offended by the truth, even if the person presenting it is not at fault. Isaiah describes God as “<span>a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:14\">Isaiah 8:14</a>) because people would not always accept His demands and the way of faith in Him. The New Testament applies these words to the offense of the gospel of Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:32-Rom9:33\">Romans 9:32</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:32-Rom9:33\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:32-Rom9:33\">33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:8\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:8</a>). During His ministry, people were offended by Jesus—by His humble birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:57\">Matthew 13:57</a>), at what he said and did (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:12\">Matthew 15:12</a>), or because of the cost of following him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:21\">Matthew 13:21</a>). Even some disciples were offended and turned away (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:61\">John 6:61</a>). Eventually, all were offended and fled from Him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:31,Matt26:56\">Matthew 26:31, 56</a>). Paul spoke of the offense in preaching the cross of Christ. He could have avoided persecution by preaching a message that did not offend anyone (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:11\">Galatians 5:11</a>). He chose to preach the cross, even though it was a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:23\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:23</a>).</p></li></ol><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7691\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Sin</span>.</p>",
