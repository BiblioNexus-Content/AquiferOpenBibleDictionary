Other members of his family, about 200 men, came with Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:4\">Ezr 8:4</a>). After the return, certain of his sons were included among the Israelites who vowed to sever their relationships with foreign wives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:30\">10:30</a>). Hasshub, Pahath-moab’s son, helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall and the tower of furnaces in Nehemiah’s day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:11\">Neh 3:11</a>). Pahath-moab, called a chief of the people, set his seal on Ezra’s covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:14\">10:14</a>).</p>",
