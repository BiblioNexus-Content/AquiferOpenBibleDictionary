    "content": "<h1>WAGES</h1><p>A payment received by a laborer in return for his work. Wages are usually in a medium of exchange, like money. But, they can be paid for any goods or services. </p><p>Jacob worked seven years for Laban&apos;s younger daughter, Rachel  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:18-Gen29:20\">Genesis 29:18</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:18-Gen29:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:18-Gen29:20\">20</a>). He then had to work another seven years when Laban did not honor their agreement. Later, Jacob’s wages were sheep and goats (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:31-Gen30:32\">Genesis 30:31</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:31-Gen30:32\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:31-Gen30:32\">32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:8\">31:8</a>). Nebuchadnezzar was given the country of Egypt as wages for his work in capturing the city of Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek29:18-Ezek29:20\">Ezekiel 29:18</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek29:18-Ezek29:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek29:18-Ezek29:20\">20</a>).</p><p>Wages were usually agreed upon by employer and employee (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:15-Gen29:19\">Genesis 29:15</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:15-Gen29:19\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:15-Gen29:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:2\">Matthew 20:2</a>). Sometimes, the employer decided the pay (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:4\">Matthew 20:4</a>). A fair wage for honest work is a biblical principle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:7\">Luke 10:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim5:18\">1&nbsp;Timothy 5:18</a>). The Lord established laws to cover this principle and judged those who violated it. Wages were to be paid promptly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:13\">Leviticus 19:13</a>). The holding back of wages is condemned in the Scripture (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:5\">Malachi 3:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:1-Jas5:6\">James 5:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:1-Jas5:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:1-Jas5:6\">6</a>).</p><p>Wages were often a source of discontent and dispute between employer and employee. When soldiers came to John the Baptist to be baptized, they asked about their future conduct. He urged them to be content with their wages (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:14\">Luke 3:14</a>). Jacob and Laban disagreed about wages. Twice, Jacob complained, “<span>He has cheated me and changed my wages ten times</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:7,Gen31:41\">Genesis 31:7, 41</a>).</p><p>The Bible also speaks of ill-gotten wages. A prostitute&apos;s wages could not be brought into the house of the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut23:18\">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>). People are warned against Balaam&apos;s error. He corrupted Israel because he “<span>loved the wages of wickedness</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:15\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:15</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6362\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Money</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3158\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Banker, Banking</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6945\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Poor, The</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7202\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Riches</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8258\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Work</span>.</p>",
