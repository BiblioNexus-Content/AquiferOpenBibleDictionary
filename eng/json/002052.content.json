    "content": "<h1>FREEDOM, LIBERTY</h1><p>The quality or state of being free. In the ancient world, slavery was everywhere. The law of Moses said that a Hebrew slave could serve six years and go free in the seventh year (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod21:2\">Exodus 21:2</a>). This law is the background for <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer34:1-Jer34:22\">Jeremiah 34. </a>Jeremiah makes two things clear: people knew the law, but&nbsp;many did not obey it. Even so, the law showed that freedom was important. After every 49 years, there was a special year called the jubilee. During this time, all property would go back to its original owners and slaves would be freed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev25:8-Lev25:24\">Leviticus 25:8–24</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek46:17\">Ezekiel 46:17</a>).</p><h2>Freedom for Slaves</h2><p>Liberty might be given to a slave for other reasons. The slave must be freed if the owner caused the loss of a slave&apos;s eye or tooth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod21:26-Exod21:27\">Exodus 21:26–27</a>). Job reflects that in Sheol or death “the slave is free from his master” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:19\">Job 3:19</a>). In another verse, he is grateful for the freedom of the wild donkey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job39:5\">39:5</a>).</p><h2>The Messiah and Freedom</h2><p>When the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one) comes, one of his tasks will be “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:1\">Isaiah 61:1</a>). Old Testament believers thought of this liberty in terms of freedom from foreign rule. But the Messiah is focused mainly on freeing people’s spirits. Liberty is a way of life before God. It is also a freedom from sin.</p><h2>Freedom in the New Testament</h2><p>In the New Testament, freedom is sometimes seen as a literal release from capture. For example, all four Gospels refer to the Jewish custom of having a prisoner set free at Passover (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark15:6-Mark15:15\">Mark 15:6–15</a>). There are references also to the release of prisoners (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:13\">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:35\">16:35</a>). Paul encouraged Christian slaves to gain their freedom if they could (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:21\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:21</a>). He asked a slave owner, Philemon, to free the slave Onesimus. Onesimus was a slave who ran away (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phlm1:1-Phlm1:25\">Philemon</a>). Paul did not argue for freedom from slavery as part of the Christian gospel. Rather, he emphasized freedom in Christ for all believers. All are free in Christ, both those who are free and those who are slaves.</p><h2>True Freedom Through Jesus</h2><p>The freedom that matters is the freedom Jesus gives. Jesus says that people are really free when the Son sets them free (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:36\">John 8:36</a>). Paul exults in the freedom that Jesus Christ brings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:24-Rom7:25\">Romans 7:24–25</a>). The same idea can be stated in terms of the truth making people free (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:32\">John 8:32</a>). Of course, these words must be understood because Jesus is himself the truth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:6\">John 14:6</a>). This is not the philosophical concept that error enslaves men while truth has a liberating effect. Truth here is that truth that is associated with Jesus, “the word of the truth, the gospel” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:5\">Colossians 1:5</a>). Paul says, “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:17\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17</a>).</p><h2>Freedom from Sin</h2><p>The New Testament argues people left to themselves cannot defeat sin. The modern world is proof of this. We may seek to do good, but evil is too powerful for us. We cannot do the good we wish to do (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:21-Rom7:23\">Romans 7:21–23</a>). But because of Christ’s saving work, the power of sin is broken. “For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death.” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:2\">Romans 8:2</a>). This truth is advanced many times. It is expressed in different ways.</p><h2>Freedom from Religious Law</h2><p>There is another freedom that belongs to the Christian. Christians are freed from the law. There were many in the first century who saw the way of salvation as keeping the commandments of God. This was commonly urged among some Jews. Some of the first Christians seem to have received the idea from them. The idea seems obvious: if we lead good lives, we will be all right with God. </p><p>The trouble with this position is that we do not lead good lives. Sin is too strong. There is a further problem. Jesus did not die for the way of law. This is given special emphasis in Galatians. Paul argues strongly that salvation is not by way of the law but by faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:25\">Romans 4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:29\">Galatians 3</a>). He complains of people who slipped in to spy on the freedom they had in Christ Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:4\">Galatians 2:4</a>). He points out that since Christ freed us, we should not submit to any form of slavery (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:1\">5:1</a>).</p><h2>Freedom for Creation</h2><p>Paul wrote that one day, all creation will be &quot;set free from its bondage to decay&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:21\">Romans 8:21</a>). Creation will, in some way, share in the freedom of the glory of God’s children. This points to a wonderful future for creation. And we should not miss the “glory” that the liberty of God’s children means.</p><h2>Using Freedom Wisely</h2><p>We may desire to take advantage of freedom since we do nothing to gain our salvation. The Bible warns us not to take advantage of our freedom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:4\">Romans 6:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:13\">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:16\">1&nbsp;Peter 2:16</a>). We must live as free people.  We must not make our freedom a way of becoming slaves to sin.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7709\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Slave, Slavery</span>.</p>",
