    "content": "<h1>DEMON</h1><p>A demon is an angel who rebelled against God, and God drove it away from his presence. Demonism involves the actions of demons, while demonology is the study of demons and their actions. Demonology aims to understand Satan&apos;s tactics to effectively exercise authority over them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor2:11\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 2:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:19\">Luke 10:19</a>).</p><h2>What are Demons?</h2><p>The English word &quot;demon&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;<em>daimon</em>,&quot; which means &quot;a divinity or deity&quot; (for instance, a false god or demon; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:20\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:20</a>). Any deity other than the one true God is considered an evil spirit or demon The word &quot;demon&quot; does not appear in the King James Version, which incorrectly translates &quot;<em>daimon</em>&quot; as &quot;devil.&quot; There is only one devil (Greek &quot;<em>diabolos</em>&quot;). The Bible uses various names, titles, and descriptions to refer to the devil. He is the leader of all other demons, and they follow him.</p><p>In the Bible, the word &quot;spirit&quot; often refers to a demon, along with a descriptive phrase. Examples include &quot;evil spirits&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:12-Acts19:13\">Acts 19:12–13</a>), &quot;unclean spirits&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:1\">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:23,Mark1:26\">Mark 1:23, 26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:16\">Acts 5:16</a>), &quot;a spirit&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:11\">Luke 13:11</a>), and &quot;<span>deaf and mute spirit</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark9:25\">Mark 9:25</a>). Spirits can be identified by their role or function. For example: </p><ul><li><p>a spirit of murder</p></li><li><p>a spirit of suicide</p></li><li><p>a spirit of lust</p></li><li><p>a spirit of depression</p></li><li><p>a spirit of fear</p></li><li><p>a spirit of lying</p></li></ul><p>These spirits are linked to various sins or attitudes that go against God.</p><p>In the Hebrew Old Testament, there is no word for &quot;demon.&quot; The term &quot;spirit of distress&quot; appears (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:23\">Judges 9:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14-1Sam16:23\">1 Samuel 16:14–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:10\">18:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:9\">19:9</a>). There are also mentions of: </p><ul><li><p>&quot;A lying spirit&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:22-1Kgs22:23\">1 Kings 22:22–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr18:20-2Chr18:22\">2 Chronicles 18:20–22</a>)</p></li><li><p>&quot;A medium&quot; (literally: familiar spirit) (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr10:13\">1 Chronicles 10:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6\">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>)</p></li><li><p>&quot;A spirit of confusion&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa19:14\">Isaiah 19:14</a>)</p></li><li><p>&quot;A spirit of deep sleep&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa29:10\">Isaiah 29:10</a>)</p></li><li><p>&quot;A spirit of prostitution&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos4:12\">Hosea 4:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos5:4\">5:4</a>)</p></li></ul><p>A powerful demon in the Old Testament is called &quot;<span>the prince of the kingdom of Persia.</span>&quot; This demon stopped the archangel Gabriel from delivering a message to Daniel. As a result, the archangel Michael helped Gabriel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan10:13\">Daniel 10:13</a>).</p><p>The number of demons is unknown, but it seems to be very large, possibly beyond counting. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev12:4\">Revelation 12:4</a> suggests that Satan led one-third of the angels astray. This means the heavenly hosts outnumber Satan&apos;s forces two to one. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:12\">Ephesians 6:12</a> describes levels of authority or ranks of demons: </p><ul><li><p>&quot;The rulers&quot; </p></li><li><p>&quot;The authorities&quot; </p></li><li><p>&quot;<span>The powers of this world’s darkness&quot;</span></p></li><li><p>&quot;<span>The spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms&quot;</span></p></li></ul><p>Demons are created beings that are personal, immortal, and cannot reconcile with God. They are powerful compared to humans but weak compared to God. God has given us authority over them. In the name of Jesus, they must obey God&apos;s people, just as they must obey the Lord.</p><h2>What Do Demons Do?</h2><p>Angels were created to worship and praise God, serve him, and act as his messengers. The Bible says they are &quot;<span>spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Fallen angels have a similar role but serve a different master. They serve the devil because they are deceived and afraid. They want to work with humans, but their goal is to carry out Satan&apos;s plans and oppose God. They tempt, deceive, and mislead people to lead them to eternal punishment. In opposing God, they attack, oppress, hinder, and accuse God&apos;s people.</p><p>Satan is not everywhere at once, so he uses demons to carry out his plans. In the parable of the sower (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:3-Matt13:9\">Matthew 13:3–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark4:1-Mark4:20\">Mark 4:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:4-Luke8:15\">Luke 8:4–15</a>), they take away the word before it can grow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark4:15\">Mark 4:15</a>). Through persecution, Satan makes some people fall away before they truly commit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark4:17\">Mark 4:17</a>). He also distracts with worldly concerns, riches, and material desires, preventing the word from producing much fruit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark4:19\">Mark 4:19</a>).</p><p>Demons follow the same pattern Satan used when he tempted Eve:</p><ol><li><p>They deny God&apos;s word and challenge its statements.</p></li><li><p>They deny the reality of death, often suggesting ideas like reincarnation.</p></li><li><p>They appeal to human vanity and pride by telling people they can become like God or be gods (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:5\">Genesis 3:1–5</a>).</p></li></ol><p>These are also the basic methods and teachings behind most cults and false religions.</p><h2>The Final Destiny of Demons</h2><p>The Bible says that God cast the angels who sinned into gloomy pits to wait for judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:4\">2&nbsp;Peter 2:4</a>). Jesus spoke of the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. He said that humans who are cursed will also go there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:41\">Matthew 25:41</a>). At the end of time, Satan and his demons will be thrown into the lake of fire (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:10\">Revelation 20:10</a>). This is the same place of eternal torment for all whose names are not written in the Book of Life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:12-Rev20:15\">Revelation 20:12–15</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3976\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Demon-possession</span>.</p>",
