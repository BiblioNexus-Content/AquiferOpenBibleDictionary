They had to be circumcised (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:48\">Exodus 12:48</a>). </p><p>However, &quot;proselytizing,&quot; or converting willing Gentiles, was more common in Jewish communities outside Palestine. Jewish people lived in many parts of the world because they were exiled or due to business or military service. They naturally brought their religious beliefs and practices with them. The Jewish way of life attracted many Gentiles. They were used to worshiping many gods (polytheism). They admired Judaism&apos;s belief in one God (monotheism) and its high ethics. Many Gentiles connected with the Jewish faith through synagogue life (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa56:1-Isa56:8\">Isaiah 56:1â€“8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:11\">Malachi 1:11</a>). Jews sought to convert Gentiles before Christ and in the early New Testament era. Both non-biblical Jewish sources, like Philo and Josephus and Roman writers, such as Horace, Seneca, and Tacitus confirm this. This continued until the life of Christ (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:15\">Matthew 23:15</a>).</p><p>The most committed seekers of Judaism became full Jews through a three-step ritual: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Circumcision</strong> (for males)</p></li><li><p><strong>Baptism</strong> to break from their non-Jewish past</p></li><li><p><strong>Sacrifice </strong>at the Jerusalem temple </p></li></ol><p>These converts were called &quot;proselytes.&quot; They were true Jews, fully obligated to follow all the Old Testament laws.</p><p>Some Gentiles admired Judaism&apos;s monotheism and morals. They were drawn to synagogue life but did not want to be circumcised. These people were known as &quot;God-fearers&quot; (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:22\">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts13:16\">13:16, 26</a>) or &quot;devout&quot; ones (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:2\">Acts 10:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:4\">17:4, 17</a>). Some Jews viewed them favorably, but others considered them no better than other Gentiles.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3999\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Diaspora of the Jews</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4666\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">God-fearer</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5535\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jew</span>.</p>",
