On (or Heliopolis) was the center of the sun-god cult, and Potiphera was likely a high-ranking priest in the cult. His name, which means “he whom Re [the son god] has given,” does not appear in Egyptian records until the tenth century BC, a fact employed by those who prefer a late date for the book of Genesis. Yet the name is known from the 15th century (the time of Moses), and its full form may be a modernization of a name common in Joseph’s era (20th century BC).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4122\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Egypt, Egyptian</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5617\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Joseph #1</span>.</p>",
