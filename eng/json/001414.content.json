The term is possibly an ironic play on the Hebrew word for “anointing.” The site may have originally been called the “Mount of Anointing” because oil from the many olive groves on its slopes was used in consecration ceremonies. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6649\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Olives, Mount of</span>.</p>",
