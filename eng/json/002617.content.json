    "content": "<h1>HOBAB</h1><p>A member of the Midianite people who was connected to Moses&apos;s family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:29\">Numbers 10:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:11\">Judges 4:11</a>). He was either Moses&apos;s father-in-law or his brother-in-law. If he was Moses&apos;s father-in-law, he was also known by two other names. He is usually called Jethro (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:1\">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:18\">4:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:1-Exod18:12\">18:1â€“12</a>). But he is also called Reuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:18\">Exodus 2:18</a>). Jethro served as a priest of Midian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:1\">Exodus 18:1</a>). He was the ancestor of the Kenite people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:11\">Judges 4:11).</a></p><p>Scholars are not sure whether Hobab was Moses&apos;s father-in-law or brother-in-law. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:11\">Judges 4:11</a>, Hobab seems to be the same person as Jethro. Some ancient copies of the Bible add the name&quot;Hobab&quot; when mentioning &quot;the Kenite, Moses&apos; father-in-law&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:16\">Judges 1:16</a>. They also add his name when talking about Reuel in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:18\">Exodus 2:18</a>. However, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:29\">Numbers 10:29a</a> could mean that Hobab was Reuel&apos;s son (making him Moses&apos;s brother-in-law). In this passage, Moses asks Hobab to help guide the Israelites through the wilderness because he knew the area well.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5528\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jethro</span>.</p>",
