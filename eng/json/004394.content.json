    "content": "<h1>PEOPLE OF THE EAST*</h1><p>Tribes located east and northeast of Canaan, many of them overtly hostile to the Jews. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:1\">Genesis 29:1</a> provides the first reference to these peoples. Jacob, en route to Haran, crossed through territory designated as “the land of the people of the east.”</p><p>The comprehensiveness of the term is evident in the way it is used to refer to nomads (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:10\">Ez 25:10</a>) or Mesopotamians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:30\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:30</a>). The term also occurs in association with specific tribes, such as the Amalekites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:3\">Jgs 6:3</a>), Ammonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:4\">Ez 25:4</a>), Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:14\">Is 11:14</a>), Kedarites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer49:28\">Jer 49:28</a>), Midianites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:33\">Jgs 6:33</a>), and Moabites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:10\">Ez 25:10</a>).</p><p>The most distinguished OT personality linked to the term is the patriarch Job, who is called the greatest man among all the people of the east (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job1:3\">Jb 1:3</a>). Job’s homeland, the land of Uz, was probably in the vicinity of Edom to the southeast of the Dead Sea.</p>",
