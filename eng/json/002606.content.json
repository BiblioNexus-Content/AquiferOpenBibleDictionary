    "content": "<h1>HIPPOPOTAMUS</h1><p>A large animal mentioned in the Bible that has been interpreted in different ways. The King James Version translates this term directly as &quot;behemoth.&quot; Today, most scholars agree it refers to the hippopotamus (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>). This is a large water animal with thick skin, a big head, a heavy hairless body, and short legs. It has toenails that look like small hoofs (similar to the hard feet of horses and cows).</p><p>The description in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:15-Job40:24\">Job 40:15â€“24</a> matches the modern hippopotamus closely. The only difference is how the tail is described. Today, hippopotamuses live only in African rivers. However, scientists have found fossil evidence that hippopotamuses once lived in parts of Israel and Palestine, possibly in the wetlands of northern Galilee and the Jordan Valley.</p><p>The hippopotamus has well-developed senses. Its eyes, ears, and nostrils are positioned so it can see, hear, and smell while staying mostly underwater. It has a large mouth, big tusks, and a short, thick throat. Its legs are so short that its belly almost touches the ground when walking on land. The hippopotamus eats plants and herbs that grow in rivers. When river food is scarce, it will look for food on land, usually at night. Even though it has a heavy body, the hippopotamus can move surprisingly quickly on land.</p>",
