Beth-shemesh means “the house of Shamash,” the Canaanite sun god. It was included in the list of cities of Dan as<em> Ir-shemesh</em> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:41\">Joshua 19:41</a>). Beth-shemesh was one of the towns of Judah gave to the Levites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:16\">Joshua 21:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:59\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:59</a>). Its inhabitants were called Beth-shemites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam6:14,1Sam6:18\">1&nbsp;Samuel 6:14, 18</a>). When the Philistines decided to getrid of the captured ark of the covenant because of the plagues in their cities, they took it to Beth-shemesh. The area was also the scene of a great victory of King Joash (Jehoash) of Israel over King Amaziah of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:21</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23\">23</a>). About a century later, Beth-shemesh was captured from King Ahaz of Judah by the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20\">2 Chronicles 28:16</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20\">20</a>). After that, the settlement fell into decline and was finally destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC.</p></li><li><p>A Canaanite city given to the tribe of Issachar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:22\">Joshua 19:22</a>).</p></li><li><p>A strong Canaanite city given to the tribe of Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:38\">Joshua 19:38</a>). The people who lived in this Beth-shemesh were not kicked out by the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:33\">Judges 1:33</a>).</p></li><li><p>The term used in the King James Version to describe the Egyptian city of Heliopolis (or On), where the sun was worshiped (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer43:13\">Jeremiah 43:13</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Heliopolis</span>.</p></li></ol>",
