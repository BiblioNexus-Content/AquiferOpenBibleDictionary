The comparison with the Anakim, the Rephaim, and the Emim shows that the Zamzummites were a race of giants. They lived in Transjordan (a region east of the Jordan River). Although their exact origin is unknown, they probably lived in the area near Rabbath-ammon.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4612\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Giants</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7171\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Rephaim</span>.</p>",
