    "content": "<h1>RATHAMIN*</h1><p>A territory transferred from the dominion of Samaria to Judah by Demetrius of Syria. A letter from Demetrius to his adjutant Lasthenes authorizing the transfer is mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc11:34\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 11:34</a>. The word is sometimes translated Ramathaim (nlt), the birthplace of Samuel and home of Elkanah and Hannah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1,1Sam1:19\">1&nbsp;Sm 1:1, 19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:19\">2:19</a>). In that case, it figures prominently in OT history, for there Saul first made acquaintance with Samuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam9:6,1Sam9:10\">9:6, 10</a>), there Samuel retreated after his last break with Saul, and there Samuel’s grave is located (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1\">25:1</a>). Textual variants Armathaim (tev “Arimathea”) and&nbsp;Ramatha are partly explained by the transposition of <em>m</em> and <em>th</em> in the Septuagint version. Two modern sites are recommended for the ancient district: Beit Rime, 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) east and north of Lydda, and Ramallah, 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.</p>",
