Ijon was one of the towns taken by Ben-hadad of Damascus during Baasha’s reign (c. 900 BC; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20\">1&nbsp;Kgs 15:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:4\">2&nbsp;Chr 16:4</a>). Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria captured the town and deported its people during Pekah’s reign (c.&nbsp;733 BC; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kgs 15:29</a>).</p>",
