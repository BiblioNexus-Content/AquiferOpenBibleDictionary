    "content": "<h1>ENCHANTMENT</h1><p>The act of casting charms or spells to influence others or to gain insight. Balaam could cast no enchantment against Israel but could only bless them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num23:23\">Numbers 23:23</a>). Enchanters were among the wise men of Nebuchadnezzar’s court. Daniel and his three friends were judged to be ten times wiser than the enchanters (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan1:20\">Daniel 1:20</a>). The enchanters were not able to recall King Nebuchadnezzar’s forgotten dream (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:2-Dan2:27\">2:2–27</a>). They could not interpret his second dream, either (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan4:7\">4:7</a>). Later, under Belshazzar, they could not read the handwriting that appeared on the palace wall (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:15\">5:7–15</a>). According to the prophet Isaiah, the great powers of Babylon’s enchantments would not save it from destruction (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa47:9,Isa47:12\">Isaiah 47:9, 12</a>). The psalmist writes of the wicked &quot;<span>refusing to hear the tune of the charmer who skillfully weaves his spell.&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps58:5\">Psalms 58:5</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6021\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Magic</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7749\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Sorcery</span>.</p>",
