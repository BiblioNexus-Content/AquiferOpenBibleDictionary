The people of Gibeon (a nearby city) tricked Joshua and the Israelites into making peace with them when the Israelites were conquering the land of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:17\">Joshua 9:17</a>). </p><p>Later, the city became part of the land given to the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh18:26\">Joshua 18:26</a>). Many years later, after the Jewish people returned from being forced to live in Babylon, some people came back to live in Chephirah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:25\">Ezra 2:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:29\">Nehemiah 7:29</a>). </p><p>Today, the ruins of this ancient city are called Khirbet Kefireh. These ruins are located southwest of where the ancient city of Gibeon once stood.</p>",
