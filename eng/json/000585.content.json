    "content": "<h1>ATAD</h1><p>The site where Jacob’s sons stopped during his funeral on the way to Hebron. It was probably in Canaan. There, at the threshing floor (where wheat was separated from chaff), Joseph&apos;s family and many Egyptians from the pharaoh’s house spent seven days mourning the death of Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:10-Gen50:11\">Genesis 50:10</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen50:10-Gen50:11\">11</a>). The Canaanites were impressed by their mourning and named the place “Abel-mizraim.” The name is a play on words, combining “meadow” and “mourning,” while the second is the Hebrew word for Egypt.</p>",
