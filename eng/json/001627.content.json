    "content": "<h1>DOEG</h1><p>Doeg was an official who worked for King Saul. Saul commanded him to kill the innocent priests at Nob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam22:23\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21–22</a>). Doeg was an Edomite. which means he was either a foreigner who converted to the Israelite religion or a prominent leader from Edom who was captured during Saul&apos;s military campaign against the Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47\">14:47</a>). </p><p>Saul put Doeg in charge of his flocks of animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7\">21:7). </a>King David also later had a foreigner in charge of his cattle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:30</a>). </p><p>The Bible does not clearly explain why Doeg was at the sanctuary at Nob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:7</a>). He might have been there for a religious purpose. If he was going through a purification process, this may have forced him to stay here (like a Nazirite vow described in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num6:13\">Numbers 6:13</a>). Another possibility is that he was hiding there as a spy for King Saul.</p><p>What we do know is that while at Nob, Doeg saw the priests welcome David and give him food and a weapon—the sword of Goliath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:9\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:9</a>). A short time later, Doeg had opportunity to report this to Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:10\">22:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps52:1\">Psalm 52 title</a>).  He hoped to demonstrate his loyalty with this report. </p><p>Doeg&apos;s character is revealed when he brutally killed the priests and all the people living in the city of Nob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:18-1Sam22:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:18–19</a>). This cruel action suggests he was not truly an Israelite, even if he lived among them.</p>",
