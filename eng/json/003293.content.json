    "content": "<h1>KENIZZITES</h1><p>A people related to Kenaz, grandson of Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:11,Gen36:15\">Gn 36:11, 15</a>). The Kenizzites were of Edomite stock and resided to the southeast of Judah in the vicinity of the Kenites. They are thought to belong to the pre-Israelite population of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:19\">Gn 15:19</a>). Their territory was to be given to the Israelites along with that of the Kenites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:19-Gen15:21\">19–21</a>).</p><p>In Numbers and Joshua, Caleb, the faithful spy, is reckoned to belong to the Kenizzites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:12\">Nm 32:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh14:6,Josh14:14\">Jos 14:6, 14</a>). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:15\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:15</a>, Caleb’s genealogy is traced back to Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:1\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:1</a>). The relationship of Caleb to the Kenizzites is far from clear. Caleb established his patrimony at Kiriath-sepher (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:11-Judg1:13\">Jgs 1:11–13</a>), which is in Judah but which is also situated close to the territory of the Kenizzites. Critical opinion views the Kenizzites as non-Israelites who occupied Hebron, Debir, and the southernmost hill country of the Negev and became politically incorporated into Judah.</p>",
