    "content": "<h1>SUCCOTH</h1><ol><li><p>A town in the Jordan Valley listed along with other towns as belonging to the tribe of Gad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:27\">Joshua 13:27</a>). Succoth is located in a fertile valley called Ghaur Abu &apos;Udeidah, known in the Bible as the valley of Succoth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps60:6\">Psalms 60:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps108:7\">108:7</a>). This valley forms the central portion of the Jordan Valley on the eastern side, between the Wadi Rejeb and the Jabbok River.</p><p>The place first appears in the story of Jacob&apos;s meeting with Esau, which happened just south of Penuel. After meeting Esau, Jacob went to Succoth and built shelters for his cattle. This is given as the explanation for the name of the settlement (Succoth means “shelters,” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen33:17\">Genesis 33:17</a>).</p><p>Later, the people of Succoth refused to give food to Gideon and his men when they were chasing the Midianites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:5-Judg8:9\">Judges 8:5–9</a>). When Gideon returned, he made sure to punish the elders of Succoth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:13-Judg8:17\">Judges 8:13–17</a>). The type of social organization described in this passage suggests that the population may not have been Israelite at the time of Gideon&apos;s visit.</p><p>Succoth is also mentioned in connection with Solomon&apos;s building projects. The metal casting for important fixtures and tools of the temple was done in the area between Succoth and Zarethan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:46\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:17\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</a>). It is possible that Succoth was destroyed by Shishak of Egypt during the time Israel was ruled by kings.</p><p>Some scholars suggest that the place-name appears in two other passages: as the gathering place for David&apos;s forces before the battle with Ammon, when the ark and the army were &quot;living in shelters (<em>sukkoth</em>)&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:11\">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:11</a>). Second, the gathering place for Ben-hadad&apos;s troops in his war against Samaria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:12,1Kgs20:16\">1&nbsp;Kings 20:12, 16</a>).</p></li><li><p>A town in Egypt mentioned as the first stopping place of the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:37\">Exodus 12:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod13:20\">13:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:5-Num33:6\">Numbers 33:5–6</a>). Succoth appears between Rameses and Etham.</p><p>Egyptian sources, texts of the Anastasi collection, refer to a place that is most likely the same as biblical Succoth. An Edomite tribe is recorded as bringing their herds in from the desert to feed them in the Delta, passing by the strong point at <em>Tkw</em> [Old Egyptian for Succoth] (Papyrus Anastasi VI, 54). The military garrison there was commanded by a leader of archer troops, and the fort was named after Pharaoh Mernephta (Papyrus Anastasi, VI, 55).</p><p>Most scholars believe Succoth is at Tell el-Maskhuta, a site near the source of the Wadi Tumeilat.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"KeyPlacesintheExodus_Map_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">map</span>.</p></li></ol>",
