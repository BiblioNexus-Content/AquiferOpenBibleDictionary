He guided the souls of dead people to Hades (the place of the dead). He was the god of fertility, the patron of music, the guardian of travelers, and the god of expressive speech.</p><p>When Paul was ministering in Lystra, the local people thought the apostle Paul was Hermes. This was because Paul performed a miracle and was the main speaker. The people of Lystra believed Paul was a god who had come to visit them in human form (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:11-Acts14:12\">Acts 14:11â€“12</a>, Mercurius in the King James Version.</p></li><li><p>A Christian to whom Paul sent greetings in his letter to Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:14\">Romans 16:14</a>).</p></li></ol>",
