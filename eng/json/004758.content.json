    "content": "<h1>REWARD</h1><p>The payment or compensation for good or evil actions. It often refers to the benefits or consequences resulting from one&apos;s actions. This concept involves ethical responsibility and accountability. Terms related to this idea include: </p><ul><li><p>Wages</p></li><li><p>Hire</p></li><li><p>Recompense</p></li><li><p>Requital</p></li></ul><p>These terms cover all rewards, including everyday interactions and God&apos;s response to human behavior. They cover both this life and the next.</p><p>To the Greek and Hebrew people, the idea of reward was linked to the idea of completing an action. Like a worker getting paid for their work, an action is believed to bring about certain results, whether a reward or a punishment. This concept is reflected in commercial language, as when Paul says, &quot;The wages of sin is death&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:23\">Romans 6:23</a>). This means that actions are expected to have equal consequences.</p><p>Biblical views on reward are both ethical and religious. God’s covenant with Israel was a sign of his favor and promised blessings for obedience to his commands. Disobedience, however, would lead to disaster and death. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68\">Deuteronomy 28</a> details the blessings for obedience and the curses for not doing what was right and good in the sight of the Lord (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46\">Leviticus 26</a>). During the wandering in the wilderness, disobedience led to suffering and death. The history of the time of the judges and kings shows that faithfulness brought blessings, and sin brought punishment. Victory and national prosperity were linked to following God’s commands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:7-Josh1:9\">Joshua 1:7–9</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:1-Judg2:23\">Judges 2</a>).</p><p>Sometimes, this pattern of reward and punishment did not seem to follow. The Jewish belief was that God is merciful and forgiving. Forgiveness involves removing the punishment for sin. As it says, “<span>He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps103:10\">Psalm 103:10</a>).</p><p>In Ecclesiastes, the writer observed that life does not always align with the principle of retribution. He noted a somewhat cynical view when the righteous suffer and the wicked prosper. Job’s friends thought his suffering was due to hidden sin, but Job maintained his integrity. In the end, Job was rewarded for his faithfulness.</p><p>By the time of Jesus, Judaism had evolved significantly. Roman law had replaced the old legal system. However, Judaism still valued good works and encouraged people to build up merit for God’s blessing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Tob4:7-Tob4:10\">Tobit 4:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Sir51:30\">Sirach 51:30</a>). The Pharisees believed that careful law observance would earn God&apos;s favor. They thought that good deeds would be rewarded, and sins would be punished if not in this life, then in the future.</p><p>Jesus also taught about reward, especially in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt7:29\">Mathew 5–7</a>). He said that God would bless those who show certain moral qualities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:1-Matt5:12\">Matthew 5:1–12</a>). People who act to be praised by others will receive only that praise, but those who seek to please God will be rewarded by him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:1\">Matthew 6:1, 4, 6, 18</a>). Jesus challenged the idea of reward with the parable of the laborers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:1-Matt20:16\">Matthew 20:1–16</a>). In it, everyone got the same wage, no matter how long they worked. He taught that we should work for motives beyond just receiving rewards. In the parable of the good shepherd, Jesus contrasts the hireling, who works only for wages, with the shepherd, who will die for the sheep (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:11-John10:14\">John 10:11–14</a>). A servant who only does his duty deserves no special reward (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:9-Luke17:10\">Luke 17:9–10</a>).</p><p>Paul introduced a new perspective on reward, especially in relation to salvation. Salvation is no longer seen as the result of doing more good than evil. It is a gift of divine favor that cannot be earned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:4-Rom4:5\">Romans 4:4–5</a>). Salvation is not earned but given by a loving God. However, rewards are still given for good deeds after salvation has been given. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:8-1Cor3:14\">First Corinthians 3:8–14</a> teaches that the quality of a person’s works will be assessed and rewarded, but salvation itself is not based on works. However, works matter for one&apos;s eternal destiny (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:24\">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:13\">Revelation 14:13</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3867\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Crown</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5663\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judgment</span>.</p>",
