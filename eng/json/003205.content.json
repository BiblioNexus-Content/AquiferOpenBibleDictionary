    "content": "<h1>JOT OR TITTLE</h1><p>An expression Jesus used in the Sermon on the Mount. </p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:18\">Matthew 5:18</a> <em>jot</em> is a transliteration of the Greek letter iota. Originally, &quot;jot&quot; referred to the Hebrew letter <em>yod</em>, the smallest letter. <em>Tittle</em> comes from Middle English. It refers to the dot over abbreviated words. The King James Version translators used it for a Greek word meaning &quot;little horn.&quot; Jews used the word to refer to the small markings that differentiate certain Hebrew letters. Jesus used both terms to stress the law&apos;s importance. He said not one jot or tittle would vanish from the law until all was fulfilled.</p>",
