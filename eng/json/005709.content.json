    "content": "<h1>UNCIRCUMCISION</h1><p>The natural condition of a male, with the foreskin covering his penis. The Jewish people, along with many other groups, surgically removed this foreskin as a sign of their covenant (agreement) with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14\">Genesis 17:9–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:48\">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev12:3\">Leviticus 12:3</a>). Because of this practice, the term &quot;uncircumcision&quot; came to mean &quot;non-Jew&quot; or &quot;gentile&quot; (Philistines, Greeks, and Romans did not practice circumcision, but Egyptians and many Semitic peoples did). The word was also used to describe &quot;those outside the covenant.&quot;</p><p>The term “uncircumcision” occurs 20 times in the New Testament, usually simply meaning &quot;gentile,&quot; as opposed to Jew. Paul presents a compelling case against making such distinctions. Paul strongly argues against making such distinctions between people. For Paul, the attitude of a person&apos;s heart toward God is much more important than following ritual law, which has nothing to do with a person&apos;s salvation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:25-Rom2:27\">Romans 2:25–27</a>). Abraham became a believer and was accepted by God while he was still uncircumcised. So circumcision has nothing to do with his salvation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:30\">Romans 3:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:9-Rom4:12\">4:9–12</a>). In the past, gentiles were excluded from being God&apos;s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:12\">Ephesians 2:11–12</a>). Now, Jewish and gentile believers have become one people in Jesus Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:7\">Galatians 2:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:6\">5:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:15\">6:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:11\">Colossians 3:11</a>). Paul refuses to listen to those requiring circumcision for full church membership.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col2:8-Col2:15\">Colossians 2:8–15</a>, Paul uses &quot;uncircumcision&quot; as a metaphor, meaning a person&apos;s state before knowing God. Here uncircumcision equals &quot;the flesh&quot; (meaning one&apos;s evil desires). It is the same as being uncircumcised. Just as physical flesh is cut away during circumcision, this spiritual &quot;flesh&quot; is cut away by Christ at the time of conversion, as shown in baptism. The baptized person is cleansed from &quot;uncleanness&quot; just as a circumcised gentile was considered cleansed from previous uncircumcised uncleanness.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3734\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Circumcision</span>.</p>",
