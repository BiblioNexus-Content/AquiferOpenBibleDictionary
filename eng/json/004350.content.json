    "content": "<h1>PATIENCE</h1><p>Patience is the ability to endure much hardship or mistreatment. It is not to lose your temper, get irritated, or seek revenge. It includes: </p><ol><li><p>The strength to endure pain without complaining</p></li><li><p>The ability to hold back when severely provoked</p></li><li><p>The self-control to avoid rash actions in adversity</p></li></ol><p>In Hebrew, the common expression for patience is related to the verb &quot;to be long,&quot; meaning being slow to get angry or upset. In Greek, two different words were translated as &quot;patience&quot; in the King James Version of the Bible: </p><ol><li><p>One word suggests &quot;remaining firm under&quot; tests and trials and is better translated as &quot;endurance&quot; or &quot;steadfastness.&quot; </p></li><li><p>The other Greek word is similar to the Hebrew meaning. It refers to patience as &quot;long-spiritedness&quot; or staying calm when provoked to anger.</p></li></ol><p>The greatest example of patience in the Bible is God himself. Many passages describe God, along with other gracious attributes, as &quot;slow to anger.&quot; Despite Israel&apos;s repeated rebellions, God is shown as forgiving. He is gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, and full of lovingkindness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:17\">Nehemiah 9:17</a>). The psalmist says, &quot;But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps86:15\">Psalm 86:15</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6\">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:18\">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps103:8\">Psalms 103:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:13\">Joel 2:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah4:2\">Jonah 4:2</a>). The Old Testament also praises the virtue of a patient spirit, especially in Proverbs (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov14:29\">Proverbs 14:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov15:18\">15:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov16:32\">16:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov25:15\">25:15</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl7:8\">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>).</p><p>The New Testament also emphasizes the Lord&apos;s patience. It is God&apos;s kindness, forbearance, and patience that lead people to repentance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:4\">Romans 2:4</a>). God was patient in delaying the Flood during Noah&apos;s time. It was while the ark was being built. This gave people more time to repent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:20\">1&nbsp;Peter 3:20</a>). Perhaps the most significant New Testament reference to God&apos;s patience is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:9\">2&nbsp;Peter 3:9</a>. Peter explains that the delay in Christ&apos;s return is not due to God&apos;s slowness. It is because of his patience that he does not want anyone to perish. Paul also mentions Jesus Christ&apos;s patience. He says that Christ showed perfect patience in his dealings with him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:16\">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:16</a>).</p><p>Patience, which is a characteristic of God and Jesus Christ, should also be seen in every Christian. Paul prayed for the Colossians, asking that they would show this quality (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:11\">Colossians 1:11</a>). Patience is: </p><ul><li><p>One of the fruits of the Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22\">Galatians 5:22</a>)</p></li><li><p>A characteristic of love (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4</a>) </p></li><li><p>A virtue (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:10\">2&nbsp;Timothy 3:10</a>)</p></li></ul><p>Christians are also urged to be patient (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:14\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:14</a>). If we are not, we may be treated like the servant in one of Jesus&apos;s parables. This servant begged his master, to whom he owed a huge debt, for patience, promising to repay everything. The master was patient and forgave all the debt. But, he found the servant refused to show the same patience to a fellow servant who owed him a small amount. (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:26-Matt18:29\">Matthew 18:26â€“29</a>)</p><p>In some contexts, &quot;patience&quot; also means waiting a long time with hope and expectation. For example, a farmer waits patiently for the crops to grow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:7\">James 5:7b</a>). Abraham waited for God to give him the land of Canaan. He died without seeing the promise fulfilled, but he still believed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:15\">Hebrews 6:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:39\">11:39</a>). Finally, all Christians are commanded to be patient until the Lord&apos;s return (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:7\">James 5:7a</a>).</p>",
