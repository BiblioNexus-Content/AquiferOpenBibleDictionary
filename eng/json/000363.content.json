    "content": "<h1>ANOINTED ONE, ANOINTED ONES</h1><p>Anointing is choosing someone for a special role or purpose. In the Bible, this often involved putting oil on the person, but it also meant being filled with God&apos;s Spirit for a special task.</p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is shown as having three important roles:</p><ul><li><p>Prophet (someone who speaks for God)</p></li><li><p>Priest (someone who helps people connect with God)</p></li><li><p>King (a ruler who leads people)</p></li></ul><p>Jesus is God’s Anointed One. “Messiah” comes from the Hebrew word meaning “anointed one.” “Christ” comes from the Greek word meaning “anointed one.” </p><p>The true anointing of Messiah is spiritual (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:2\">Psalms 2:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:25-Dan9:26\">Daniel 9:25–26</a>). It is an anointing by the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:1\">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:1\">Luke 4:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:18-Luke4:19\">18–19</a>). Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the Anointed One or Messiah of Old Testament prophecy. This was confirmed by his anointing by the Holy Spirit and by the miracles that followed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:32-John1:51\">John 1:32–51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:33-Luke4:37\">Luke 4:33–37</a>). Like Jesus, Christians also are said to be anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit helps them understand their faith and to live lives that please God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor1:21-2Cor1:22\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 1:21–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:20,1John2:27\">1&nbsp;John 2:20, 27</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6259\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Messiah</span>.</p>",
