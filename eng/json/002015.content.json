The Fish Gate was built in David’s time and later formed part of Manasseh’s fortifications (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr33:14\">2&nbsp;Chr 33:14</a>). After the Babylonian exile, it was restored under Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:3\">Neh 3:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:39\">12:39</a>); it is mentioned along with the Mishneh or Second Quarter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph1:10\">Zep 1:10</a>). The gate was probably so named either because fish were brought into the city from the north, or because it was located near the city’s fish market.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5501\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jerusalem</span>.</p>",
