    "content": "<h1>COMPASSION</h1><p>The quality of showing kindness, favor, graciousness, or mercy. In the Bible, God is described as being like a compassionate father to those who revere him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps103:13\">Psalm 103:13</a>). Jesus Christ exemplified God&apos;s compassion through his preaching, healing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:36\">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt14:14\">14:14</a>), concern for humanity&apos;s lostness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:41\">Luke 19:41</a>), and ultimately in his sacrifice on the cross (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:8\">Romans 5:8</a>). The church is called to demonstrate compassion as part of the love Jesus commanded (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:4-Matt5:7\">Matthew 5:4–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:8-Jas2:18\">James 2:8–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:18\">1&nbsp;John 3:18</a>).</p><p>In the Old Testament, compassion describes an aspect of God&apos;s covenant relationship with his people. One Hebrew word for &quot;compassion&quot; comes from a root meaning &quot;womb,&quot; comparing God&apos;s love to the love of a mother. God&apos;s compassion was always demonstrated through actions that affirmed his covenant with Israel. Despite Israel&apos;s rebellions, God still had compassion on his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:23\">2&nbsp;Kings 13:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr36:15\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 36:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:38\">Psalm 78:38</a>) and all creation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps145:9\">Psalm 145:9</a>). Even when Israel feared God had withdrawn his favor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps77:9\">Psalm 77:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa27:11\">Isaiah 27:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa63:15\">63:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer13:14\">Jeremiah 13:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer21:7\">21:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos13:14\">Hosea 13:14</a>), God&apos;s compassion would revive, and he would restore his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:3\">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps135:14\">Psalm 135:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:1\">Isaiah 14:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa49:13\">49:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:7-Isa54:8\">54:7–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer12:15\">Jeremiah 12:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer30:18\">30:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic7:19\">Micah 7:19</a>).</p><p>In the New Testament, Jesus Christ perfectly reflected the Father&apos;s compassion in his interactions with humanity. He healed, cast out spirits, empowered others, and sent them to do likewise. Jesus fed the hungry and raised the dead. His parables, like the Good Samaritan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:33\">Luke 10:33</a>) and the Prodigal Son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke15:20\">Luke 15:20</a>), further illustrated compassion.</p><p>The apostle Paul listed compassion as a primary quality for the Colossian church to embody (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>). Compassion was an important part of the Christian community. The Greek word used literally means &quot;to be moved in one&apos;s bowels,&quot; pointing to the core of one&apos;s inner feelings, similar to how &quot;heart&quot; is used today. This intense inner feeling should always lead to outward acts of mercy and kindness.</p>",
