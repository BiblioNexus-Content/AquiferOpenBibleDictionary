    "content": "<h1>CHERUB, CHERUBIM</h1><p>Cherubim are special winged creatures described in the Bible. The word “cherubim” is the plural form of the Hebrew word “cherub.” These beings are a type of supernatural creatures, like seraphim and angels. Some scholars think the term &quot;cherub&quot; may come from the <em>karibu</em> (meaning &quot;intercessor&quot;) in Akkadian mythology. In Mesopotamian art, they were often shown as griffins (half lion and half eagle) or humans with wings. The sphinx (a mythical creature from ancient Egypt that had a human head and a lion&apos;s body) might also be connected to this idea. However, the descriptions in the Bible show that cherubim were different from these other ancient creatures.</p><p>The prophet Ezekiel described four “living creatures.” Each creature had four faces and four wings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:5-Ezek1:24\">Ezekiel 1:5–24</a>). Later in his writings, Ezekiel revealed that these creatures were cherubim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek10:2-Ezek10:22\">Ezekiel 10:2–22</a>). Later in his writings, Ezekiel revealed that these creatures were cherubim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13-Ezek28:16\">Ezekiel 28:13–16</a>). Some people believe this story about the king of Tyre also tells us about Satan. They think it describes how Satan fell from his position as one of God&apos;s high-ranking heavenly beings.</p><p>Even though Ezekiel described cherubim in detail, it is difficult to know exactly what they looked like. So, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek41:18\">Ezekiel 41:18,</a> the cherubim in the temple he saw in a vision had only two faces: one of a man and one of a young lion. This is different from the four-faced creatures in his earlier vision. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:10\">Ezekiel 1:10</a> were those of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. However, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek10:14\">Ezekiel 10:14</a>, one of the faces is called “the face of the cherub,” which could refer to an ox’s face. This may explain why ancient Near Eastern art showed cherubim as four-legged creatures. They are usually different from the biblical cherubim. In Ezekiel’s vision, cherubim had wings, straight legs, and hooves like those of a calf  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:7\">Ezekiel 1:7</a>).</p><p>Some scholars, puzzled by this, seek links between biblical cherubim and statues or carvings from other cultures. For example, the throne of Ahiram, king of Byblos, had sphinxes on both sides. Some believe they were cherubim. The sphinx was a common decorative symbol in the ancient world. It was on objects from Megiddo, Samaria, and Nimrud. Also, ancient art shows other decorative creatures. They have human and animal parts, and wings. But, none match the Old Testament&apos;s descriptions of cherubim.</p><p>The four living creatures in Revelation are like Ezekiel&apos;s cherubim. But, they lack the &quot;whirling wheels&quot; from Ezekiel&apos;s vision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:6-Rev4:9\">Revelation 4:6–9</a>). Later references to the creatures in Revelation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:6-Rev5:14\">Revelation 5:6–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev6:1-Rev6:8\">6:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:1-Rev7:11\">7:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev14:3\">14:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev15:7\">15:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:4\">19:4</a>) do not describe them further.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:24\">Genesis 3:24</a> cherubim guard the entrance of Eden. This is a common role for supernatural beings in Near Eastern traditions. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1-Ezek10:22\">Ezekiel 10</a> cherubim also carry out God’s judgment by spreading burning coals over a city  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek10:2,Ezek10:7\">Ezekiel 10:2, 7</a>).</p><p>In early Israelite tradition, cherubim provided God with a throne by stretching out their wings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:4\">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:2\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:2</a>; and more.). God spoke to Moses from this throne, which was located on the cover of the ark of the Testimony (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:22\">Exodus 25:22</a>). In Ezekiel’s vision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:26\">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1\">10:1</a>) God sits on a chariot with four wheels that is moved by cherubim, who lift it with their wings. In Hebrew poetry, God is sometimes described as riding on clouds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:3\">Psalm 104:3</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa19:1\">Isaiah 19:1</a>) or flying on a cherub (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam22:11\">2&nbsp;Samuel 22:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps18:10\">Psalm 18:10</a>). Near Eastern art shows gods standing on the backs of animals. It also shows cherubim supporting a divine throne.</p><p>In Israel, cherubim were carved on the ark of the Testimony (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:18-Exod25:20\">Exodus 25:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod37:7-Exod37:9\">37:7–9</a>). They were also on the tabernacle&apos;s curtains and the veil covering the innermost sanctuary (most sacred room), where the ark was kept.</p><p>The Most Holy Place in Solomon’s temple featured two large cherubim made of olive wood and covered in gold. With their wings outstretched, they spanned the inner sanctuary&apos;s width. The temple&apos;s wooden panels and doors were carved with smaller cherubim and palm trees. They were also on the sides of the laver stands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:29,1Kgs7:36\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:29, 36</a>). Ezekiel&apos;s vision of the temple showed cherubim and palm trees alternating in the decoration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek41:17-Ezek41:20\">Ezekiel 41:17–20</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2779\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Angel</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7403\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Seraph, Seraphim</span>.</p>",
