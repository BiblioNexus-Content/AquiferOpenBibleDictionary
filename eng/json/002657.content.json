    "content": "<h1>HORMAH</h1><p>A town near Beersheba in the Negev. It was on the border of the tribes of Judah and Simeon. </p><p>At first, it was a Canaanite settlement. Then it belonged to the tribe of Judah, and then to the tribe of Simeon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:30\">Joshua 15:30</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:4,Josh19:9\"> 19:4, 9</a>). By the time Israel had its first kings, Judah controlled this area again (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:30\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:30</a>). </p><p>The Canaanite name &quot;Zephath&quot; changed to &quot;Hormah&quot; when the Hebrews first conquered it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:17\">Judges 1:17</a>). Hormah became loyal to David during his ongoing feud with King Saul. David rewarded the town by sending it some of the war spoils of Ziklag (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:31\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30</a>). </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:30\">Joshua 15:30</a> describes Hormah as being in the south near Kesil and Ziklag. But its exact location remains unknown. From the reference in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:45\">Numbers 14:45</a>, it could be south of Kadesh-barnea. This is where the Israelites spent much of the wilderness period.</p>",
