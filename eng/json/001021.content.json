    "content": "<h1>BOIL</h1><p>An inflamed area of swelling on the skin. In modern medicine, a &quot;boil&quot; is a pus-filled swelling. It is caused by infectious germs, usually <em>staphylococci</em>. The pus is a mixture of germs and white blood cells, the body’s defense against germs. Although painful, boils usually heal naturally after rupturing or being cut open. A more severe boil with several openings is called a <em>carbuncle</em>. If the infection goes deeper and injures internal organs or tissues, it is called an <em>abscess</em> and can even be fatal.</p><p>In the Bible, the word translated as “boil” probably referred to a variety of skin diseases. The sixth plague that God inflicted on Egypt through Moses and Aaron was a plague of boils (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod9:9-Exod9:11\">Exodus 9:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:27,Deut28:35\">Deuteronomy 28:27, 35</a>) or blisters. Boils or skin eruptions of a certain type were described in the Mosaic laws about health and cleanliness as one sign of leprosy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev13:1-Lev13:8,Lev13:18-Lev13:23\">Leviticus 13:1–8, 18–23</a>). Job’s “<span>terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:7-Job2:8,Job2:12\">Job 2:7–8, 12</a>) were probably too widespread to be called boils in the modern sense. He may have had: </p><ul><li><p>Smallpox</p></li><li><p>Psoriasis </p></li><li><p>Tubercular leprosy</p></li><li><p>Some other disease that caused severe itching</p></li></ul><p>King Hezekiah’s boil was probably a group of boils (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:1-2Kgs20:7\">2&nbsp;Kings 20:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa38:21\">Isaiah 38:21</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6925\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Plagues upon Egypt</span>.</p>",
