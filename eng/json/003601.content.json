Jeremiah did this because Pashhur put him in stocks for prophesying judgment upon Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer19:14-Jer20:2\">Jer 19:14–20:2</a>). The name Pashhur means “prosperity round about” and was changed to “terror on every side” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer20:3\">20:3</a>) because Pashhur was to see the horrors of the Babylonian invasion.</p>",
