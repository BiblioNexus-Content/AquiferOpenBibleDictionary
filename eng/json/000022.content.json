He threw his coat over Elisha’s shoulders, symbolizing God’s call to Elisha to become a prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21\">1&nbsp;Kings 19:19</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21\">21</a>). Earlier, the town is mentioned as one place where the Midianites fled from Gideon’s 300 warriors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:22\">Judges 7:22</a>). It is also mentioned in a list of districts set up by King Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:12\">1&nbsp;Kings 4:12</a>). </p><p>Abel-meholah is likely modern-day Khirbet Tell el-Hilu.</p>",
