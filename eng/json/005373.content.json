In the house of Judas on this street, Ananias baptized Paul and Paul&apos;s sight was restored (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:11\">Acts 9:11</a>). People called the street “Straight” because, unlike many other streets in the city, this one was actually ran in a straight line. </p><p>The street still exists today and is still straight, though the current street is about 4.6 meters (15 feet) higher than the original route. People still call the street by this same name (the French name is Rue Droite). It runs east and west on the south boundary of the Christian section of town. The “house of Judas” is no longer there. But in a lane off the eastern end of Straight Street is the “house of Ananias.”</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3910\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Damascus</span>.</p>",
