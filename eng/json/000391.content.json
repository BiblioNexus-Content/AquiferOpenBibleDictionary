These groups joined in writing King Artaxerxes of Babylon to stop the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. </p><p>Apharsathchites could refer to a specific ethnic group or government leaders (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9\">Ezra 4:9</a>, King James Version). A similar Old Persian word meant “messengers.” </p><p>Apharsachites could be a shortened form of Apharsathchites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:6\">Ezra 5:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra6:6\">6:6</a>, King James Version). It could also be derived from an old Persian word for “investigators.” </p><p>Apharsites is similar to the Hebrew word for “Persians” and has been translated that way (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9\">Ezra 4:9</a>, King James Version).</p>",
