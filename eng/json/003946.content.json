    "content": "<h1>MORIAH</h1><p>Moriah is a name that appears twice in the Old Testament. </p><p>The first time is in the story of Abraham. God sent Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac in “the land of Moriah” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:2\">Genesis 22:2</a>). In that place, God provided a ram to take Isaac’s place. The story also says that God “appeared” to Abraham there. Some people think the name “Moriah” may be linked to the Hebrew word <em>ra’ah</em>, which can mean “see,” “provide,” or “appear.” The ending -iah is short for the Lord’s name and is found in many Hebrew names.</p><p>The second mention is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr3:1\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 3:1</a>. This verse says that Solomon built the temple on Mount Moriah. It also says that this was the place where the Lord appeared to David. It connects the mountain with the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:1-2Sam24:25\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr21:1-1Chr21:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 21</a>). But the Bible does not directly say this is the same place where Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac.</p><p>Some people believe the two stories happened in the same place because both tell of the Lord appearing. The Jewish historian Josephus (<em>Antiquities</em> 1.13.2; 7.13.4) said that Solomon’s temple stood on the same place where Isaac was offered. The book of <em>Jubilees</em> (written in the 100s BC) also connects the two events (Jubilees 18:13). </p><p>Other traditions have different views. Samaritan tradition says Moriah was Mount Gerizim. In Muslim tradition, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem marks the place where Abraham offered Isaac. The large rock under the dome is thought to be the site of the sacrifice.</p>",
