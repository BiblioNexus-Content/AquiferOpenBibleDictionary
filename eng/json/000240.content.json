Alexander then fought and beat the Syrian King Demetrius I.</p><p>To strengthen his position, Alexander married the daughter of Ptolemy VI, king of Egypt. However, in 147 BC, Demetrius II challenged Alexander, and Alexander was defeated in 145 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc10:1-1Macc11:74\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 10â€“11</a>).</p>",
