When the porcupine feels threatened, it can raise these quills to look bigger.</p><p>Porcupines are most active at night. During the day, they rest in holes or cracks in rocks. They live in different places like forests, rocky hills, and valleys. There are two main types of porcupines. The kind found in the Middle East and Africa (called Old World porcupines) usually stays on the ground. The kind found in North and South America (called New World porcupines) often climbs trees.</p><p>A porcupine can grow very large, weighing up to 27.2 kilograms (60 pounds). It eats many different things, including:</p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Fruit</p></li><li><p>Tree bark</p></li><li><p>Roots</p></li><li><p>Plants</p></li><li><p>Dead animals</p></li></ul><p>While people can eat porcupine meat, the ancient Israelites did not eat it because it was not considered ceremonially clean according to the law of Moses. Many translations of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa34:11\">Isaiah 34:11</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:23\">14:23 </a>use the word “porcupine.” Other translations use “hedgehog” or “owl.” The exact animal is uncertain.</p><p><em>See also </em><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2782\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Animals</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4931\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hedgehog</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6706\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Owl</span>.</p>",
