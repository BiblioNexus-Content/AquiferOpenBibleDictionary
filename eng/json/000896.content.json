Assyria conquered Beth-eden and forcibly sent its people to Kir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9\">2&nbsp;Kings 16:9</a>). This fulfilled the prediction in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:5\">Amos 1:5</a> (“house of Eden” in the King James Version). Beth-eden, which means “house of delight,” is connected to the Eden that is listed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:23\">Ezekiel 27:23.</a> We do not know where it was. Its inhabitants are referred to as the “people of Eden” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:12\">2&nbsp;Kings 19:12</a>.</p>",
