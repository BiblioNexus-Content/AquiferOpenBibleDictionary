Heliopolis means &quot;City of the Sun&quot; in Greek. The city was a major center for sun worship in ancient Egypt, which explains why it was called the &quot;City of the Sun.&quot; Some Hebrew manuscripts read <em>&apos;ir ha-heres</em> (&quot;City of Destruction&quot;) instead, possibly reflecting a scribal variation or intentional alteration.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Heliopolis</span>.</p>",
