He was a Syrian general who served under two kings: Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Demetrius Soter. Nicanor may have been the supreme commander over Ptolemy and&nbsp;Gorgias in Lysias&apos;s first campaign against Judas Maccabeus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:38-1Macc3:59\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 3:38ff</a>.) This was during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. </p><p>Nicanor died in the battle at&nbsp;Adasa and Beth-horon in 161 BC. According to 2&nbsp;Maccabees, Judas hung the head of Nicanor from the citadel (a fortress in Jerusalem) as a clear proof of the God&apos;s victory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc15:35\">15:35</a>).</p></li><li><p>One of the seven men chosen by the early church to manage the daily distribution of food to the poor believers in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:5\">Acts 6:5</a>). These seven men were selected to ensure that widows and others in need received fair treatment in the daily distribution of food.</p></li></ol>",
