This is where Joab stopped when he was counting the people for David&apos;s census.</p><p>Some scholars think this name might be a copying mistake, since no town with a similar name is known to have existed in that area. Others believe it means &quot;Dan in the wood,&quot; and is simply referring to the city of Dan (see Revised Standard Version). Still others think it might be a town within the territory of Dan, possibly called Jaan, but all traces of this town have disappeared over time.</p>",
