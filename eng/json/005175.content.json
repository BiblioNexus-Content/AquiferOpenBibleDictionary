King David&apos;s army defeated Shobach&apos;s forces completely, killing Shobach himself. This decisive victory broke the Ammonite-Syrian alliance. As a result, the kingdoms that had been under Hadadezer&apos;s control became subject to David instead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16-2Sam10:18\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:16–18</a>). He is also called Shophach in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:16-1Chr19:18\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:16–18</a>.</p>",
