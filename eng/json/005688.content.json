    "content": "<h1>TUBAL</h1><p>Fifth of the listed sons of Japheth in the table of nations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:2\">Gn 10:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:5\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:5</a>). Tubal later gained significance in the prophetic writings of Isaiah and Ezekiel as one of the nations that would be judged for threatening God’s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:19\">Is 66:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:13\">Ez 27:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek32:26\">32:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek38:2-Ezek38:3\">38:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek39:1\">39:1</a>). Tubal is typically mentioned with Javan and Meshech as either nations of the north or nations of the coastlands (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:19\">Is 66:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek38:2\">Ez 38:2</a>). The fact that Tubal traded with Tyre (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek27:13\">Ez 27:13</a>) supports the premise that Tubal was located in a coastland region. Beyond this sketchy evidence, it is difficult to determine Tubal’s precise ethnic identification or location. It has been identified with the Scythians, the Iberians, the region between the Black and the Caspian Seas, Thessaly, and various Hittite tribes.</p>",
