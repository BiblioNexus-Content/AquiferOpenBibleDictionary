    "content": "<h1>ZOAR</h1><p>One of the “cities of the plain” confederate with Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:2,Gen14:8\">Gn 14:2, 8</a>). Zoar, also known by its earlier name Bela, is best known as the town that served as a temporary refuge for Lot and his daughters during the destruction of Sodom and the other cities of the plain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:22-Gen19:23,Gen19:30\">19:22–23, 30</a>). Despite the fact that Zoar was evidently a small town (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:22\">22</a>; Zoar means “little”), this place was evidently considered a significant geographical landmark in ancient times. When Abraham and Lot divided the land, Lot selected the land close to Zoar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:10\">13:10</a>). When Moses surveyed the Promised Land from Mt Pisgah, Zoar was reckoned as the southern terminus of the plain of the valley of Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:3\">Dt 34:3</a>). During the prophetic period, Zoar was evidently considered to be on the southern boundary of Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:5\">Is 15:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:4,Jer48:34\">Jer 48:4, 34</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3739\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of the Plain</span>.</p>",
