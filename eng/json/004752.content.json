    "content": "<h1>REUBEN, Tribe of</h1><h2>The Beginning of the Tribe of Reuben</h2><p>The tribe that descended from Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:32\">Genesis 29:32</a>). As the firstborn, Reuben’s tribe was often listed first among the tribes of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:4\">Numbers 13:4</a>). The tribe of Reuben was also named first among the two-and-a-half tribes that settled east of the Jordan River (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:12\">Joshua 1:12</a>). However, despite its position of honor, Reuben&apos;s tribe gradually lost its prominence. This was partly due to Reuben’s sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:22\">Genesis 35:22</a>), which led his father, Jacob, to prophesy that Reuben would lose his leadership among the tribes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:4\">49:4</a>). Although <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:6\">Deuteronomy 33:6 </a>contains a prayer for Reuben’s survival, the tribe did decline.</p><h2>Historical Role and Struggles</h2><p>During Israel&apos;s time in the desert, Reuben had a role just like the other tribes, sending a leader and a spy to explore the land of Canaan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:5\">Numbers 1:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:4\">Numbers 13:4</a>). However, only the spies from Ephraim (Joshua) and Judah (Caleb) were faithful. The other tribes failed to trust God, and Reuben was not any better or worse than the others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:6\">Numbers 14:6</a>). </p><p>Reuben&apos;s history includes the revolt of two Reubenites, Dathan and Abiram, against Moses’ authority (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:1\">Numbers 16:1</a>). This may have been an attempt to restore Reuben to its leading position among the tribes. This rebellion failed, with a severe judgment from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:33\">Numbers 16:33</a>).</p><h2>Wealth and Land Settlements</h2><p>Reuben’s tribe was known for its wealth in cattle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1\">Numbers 32:1</a>). The tribe initially sought to remain on the eastern side of the Jordan in lands taken from the Amorite kings Sihon and Og. Although Moses rebuked them for this request, the Reubenites and their allies, Gad and half of Manasseh, agreed to help fight for their fellow Israelites across the Jordan. Moses granted their request (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:20-Num32:22\">Numbers 32:20–22</a>). They fought well and were allowed to return home after the campaign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh22:1-Josh22:6\">Joshua 22:1–6</a>). Though separated by the Jordan River, they built a memorial altar to show they still saw themselves as part of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh22:10\">Joshua 22:10</a>).</p><h2>Decline and Later History</h2><p>Reuben&apos;s tribe did not appear again until the time of the prophetess Deborah. When Israel rallied to fight against Sisera, Reuben did not respond to the call. The tribe seemed to value material wealth more than joining in battle. For example, they chose the fertile lands of Transjordan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:5\">Numbers 32:5</a>). Life as shepherds was likely more appealing than a life of warfare (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:16\">Judges 5:16</a>). Reuben’s behavior reflected the prophecy that they would be &quot;unstable as water&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:4\">Genesis 49:4</a>).</p><p>Later, Reuben’s lands were likely overtaken by the Moabites. The area became a battleground between Israel and other nations, like Aram (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:3\">1&nbsp;Kings 22:3</a>). The tribe was among the first to be devastated by the Assyrians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 15:29</a>). Although Ezekiel’s vision mentions a small portion of land for Reuben (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:6\">Ezekiel 48:6</a>), the tribe seems to have largely faded after the exile. Reuben is listed among the redeemed in the book of Revelation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:5\">Revelation 7:5</a>), but no individuals from the tribe are mentioned in the New Testament.</p>",
