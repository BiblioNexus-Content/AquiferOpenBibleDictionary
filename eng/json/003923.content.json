    "content": "<h1>MOAB, MOABITES</h1><p>Moab was a small kingdom in central Transjordan (east of the Jordan River). Moabites were the people who lived in Moab. The land of Moab was located on a high plateau. The steep cliff of the Jordan Valley formed a natural boundary between Moab and Judah to the west.</p><p>The northern boundary of Moab changed depending on how strong the kingdom was at different times. When Moab was powerful, its territory extended north to the area around Heshbon. When Moab was weaker, the Arnon River (modern Wadi el-Mojib) served as its northern border.</p><p>The eastern boundary of the kingdom was formed by the edge of the Syrian desert. This was because the eastern boundary marked the limit of land that could be farmed.To the south, the Zered River (modern Wadi el-Hesa) separated Moab from the neighboring kingdom of Edom.</p><p>Even at its largest size, ancient Moab was a relatively small territory. It measured only about 96.5 kilometers ( 60 miles) from north to south and about 32.2&nbsp;kilometers (20 miles) from east to west.</p><h2>Land Features of Moab</h2><p>Most of Moab is a gentle, rolling tableland divided by many ravines. The King&apos;s Highway, an important ancient road, went through the center of Moab. This route was likely significant for military movement and trade throughout the region&apos;s history (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:21-Num21:22\">Numbers 21:21–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg11:17\">Judges 11:17</a>). </p><p>The high plateau of Moab has always been known for its excellent grazing land for animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4\">2&nbsp;Kings 3:4</a>). The soil and climate in Moab are also very good for growing crops like wheat and barley.</p><h2>Origins of Moab</h2><p>According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:37\">Genesis 19:37</a>, the Moabites descended from Moab. Moab was the son of Lot and his oldest daughter. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:10-Deut2:11\">Deuteronomy 2:10–11</a> is tells us that before the Moabites lived in this region, a people called the Emim were there. This information relates to the time when the Hebrew people were preparing to enter the land. However, the Bible does not explain how Lot&apos;s descendants, the Emim, and the people living in Moab at the time of the Hebrew invasion were connected.</p><p>So far, historians have not found specific information about how the Moabite kingdom began. The kingdom existed from around 1300 BC to 600 BC. What we know about Moabite history and culture during this time comes from archaeological discoveries and ancient texts, including writings from Egypt, Assyria, and the Old Testament.</p><h2>Early Relations with Israel</h2><p>Before the Israelites traveled through the land east of the Jordan River, the Moabites had lost control of their territory north of the Arnon River. This area was ruled by Sihon, an Amorite king who governed from Heshbon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:13,Num21:26\">Numbers 21:13, 26</a>). </p><p>The Israelites asked for permission to travel through Edom and Moab along the King&apos;s Highway, but they were refused. They then fought against Sihon and won in one of their most famous battles. King Balak of Moab was afraid that Israel might conquer his land. He went to war against the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:6\">Numbers 22:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:9\">Joshua 24:9</a>). He hired the Mesopotamian fortune teller, Balaam, to pronounce a curse upon his enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25\">Numbers 22–24</a>). </p><p>The tribes of Reuben and Gad settled in the territory of Sihon. The Arnon River formed the border between Israel and Moab (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:42\">32</a>). The land north of the Arnon River was once controlled by Moab. This area became a source of conflict after the Israelites took it from King Sihon. Later, this territory was involved in idol worship practices at a place called Shittim (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:18\">25</a>).</p><h2>Period of the Judges and Ruth</h2><p>For a time, Eglon, the king of Moab, ruled over the Hebrew tribes on both sides of the Jordan River until he was killed by Ehud (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:12-Judg3:30\">Judges 3:12–30</a>). By the time of Jephthah, the Israelites had regained control of northern Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg11:26\">11:26</a>). The book of Ruth shows that there were also periods when Moab and Israel lived peacefully with each other.</p><h2>Kingdom Period to Babylonian Conquest</h2><p>During the reigns of Saul and David, from the late 11th until the mid-10th centuries BC, Moab and Israel were at war. Israel usually had the advantage in these conflicts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47\">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:2\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:2</a>). King Solomon had Moabite women in his harem. He also built a high place (a place of worship) for Chemosh, the main god of the Moabites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1,1Kgs11:7\">1&nbsp;Kings 11:1, 7</a>). </p><p>After the kingdom of Israel split in 930 BC, Moab enjoyed a short period of independence. This ended when the Israelite kings Omri and Ahab took control of Moab and its king, Mesha, during the ninth century BC. The famous Moabite Stone describes the conflict between Mesha and the dynasty of Omri. This stone and other shorter texts show that the Moabite language was very similar to Old Testament Hebrew.</p><p>Moab continued to fight with its neighbors (Israel, Judah, Edom, and most importantly, Assyria). The fighting continued until the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Moabite kingdom early in the sixth century BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek25:8-Ezek25:11\">Ezekiel 25:8–11</a>). These conflicts are recorded in Assyrian writings, which tell us that Moab became a servant state to Assyria in the late eighth century BC. The conflicts are also recorded in the Old Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:1-2Kgs3:27\">2&nbsp;Kings 3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:32-2Kgs10:33\">10:32–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:20\">13:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:2\">24:2</a>). </p><p>The hatred between Moab, Israel, and Judah is especially clear in several prophecies against the Moabites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa16:14\">Isaiah 15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer9:25-Jer9:26\">Jeremiah 9:25–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:1-Jer48:47\">48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos2:1-Amos2:3\">Amos 2:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:8-Zeph2:11\">Zephaniah 2:8–11</a>). These passages mention some of the major towns in ancient Moab (Nebo, Medeba, Heshbon, Dibon, Ar, Kir, and Horonaim).</p><h2>Later History of Moab</h2><p>After the Babylonian conquest, the Persians took control of the region of Moab. Various Arab peoples moved into the area, especially the Nabateans. Although the Moabite kingdom was never established again, people with Moabite ancestry were still recognized in later Old Testament times (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:1\">Ezra 9:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:1,Neh13:23\">Nehemiah 13:1, 23</a>). The Jewish community that returned from exile was concerned about following the law written in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut23:3-Deut23:6\">Deuteronomy 23:3–6</a>, which restricted Moabites from joining the assembly of God.</p><p>In AD 106, the region of Moab became part of the Roman province of Arabia. Archaeological research has added much information about Moabite history and culture from prehistoric times through the Ottoman period.</p><h2>Religion in Moab</h2><p>During the third and second millennia BC, the religion of Moab was probably similar to what the Canaanites practiced. Over time, however, Moabite religion developed into its own distinct system. </p><p>Although the Moabites worshiped other gods, Chemosh was their main national god. The Old Testament refers to the Moabites as the &quot;people of Chemosh&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:29\">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:46\">Jeremiah 48:46</a>). The frequent appearance of &quot;Chemosh&quot; in Moabite personal names shows how important this god was to them. The Moabite Stone mentions Chemosh about twelve times. These references generally describe him as a god of war who leads his people in battle against their enemies.</p><p>They sought divine guidance and favor from their gods. The people respected diviners (people who could predict the future) and oracles (messages from the gods; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25\">Numbers 22–24</a>). Moabite religion included a priesthood and a system of sacrifices (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:7\">Jeremiah 48:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num22:40-Num23:30\">Numbers 22:40–23:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:1-Num25:5\">25:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:27\">2&nbsp;Kings 3:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:35\">Jeremiah 48:35</a>). </p><p>No one has discovered a Moabite sanctuary. But, the Moabite Stone and the Old Testament mention their existence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:7\">1&nbsp;Kings 11:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:13\">2&nbsp;Kings 23:13</a>). Tombs found at Dibon were filled with carefully arranged items, suggesting that the Moabites believed in life after death.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3573\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Canaanite Deities and Religion</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6351\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Moabite Stone</span>.</p>",
