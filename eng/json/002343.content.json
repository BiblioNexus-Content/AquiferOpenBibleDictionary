    "content": "<h1>HAIRSTYLES AND BEARDS</h1><p>In Palestine and the Near East, women typically had long hair. In the New Testament era, cutting one&apos;s hair could be seen as a sign of being a pagan priestess, leading to disgrace (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:15\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:15</a>). The apostle Peter advised Christian women not to focus excessively on elaborate hairstyles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:3\">1&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a>). When a woman married, she often altered her hairstyle to reflect a more mature look, with some using curling tongs and hair oils.</p><p>Dark hair is commonly mentioned in the Bible, though gray hair was respected as a sign of maturity. Some people used black and red hair dyes, and tradition holds that Herod the Great dyed his graying hair with henna.</p><p>In Jewish culture, beard and hair trimming followed specific rules. Israelites were instructed not to cut the hair on their temples or trim the edges of their beards (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev19:27\">Leviticus 19:27</a>). This practice helped distinguish Israelites from the idol-worshipping Canaanites and others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut12:29-Deut12:30\">Deuteronomy 12:29</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut12:29-Deut12:30\">30</a>). Beards set Hebrews apart from Egyptians, who were usually clean-shaven but sometimes wore false beards for ceremonies. Shaving or cutting the beard of captives was seen as a severe humiliation, while a shaved head was a symbol of purification after completing a vow (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev14:8-Lev14:9\">Leviticus 14:8</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev14:8-Lev14:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:18\">Acts 18:18</a>). Shaving a beard was the usual sign of mourning (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:2\">Isaiah 15:2</a>). It could also symbolize the approach of doom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa7:20\">Isaiah 7:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer41:5\">Jeremiah 41:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:37\">48:37</a>).</p>",
