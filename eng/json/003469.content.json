The letter begins with &quot;<span>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle.&quot; </span>Though Paul spoke the words, a man named Tertius wrote them down (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:22\">16:22</a>). Scholars of all viewpoints agree that Paul wrote this letter. In fact, Romans appears first in almost every ancient list of Paul&apos;s letters.</p><h2>Who Was the Letter Written For? From Where Was the Letter Written? </h2><p>Paul sent this letter to the Christians in Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:7\">Romans 1:7</a>). He wrote it while he was in the city of Corinth. We know this because he mentions Erastus, who was Corinth&apos;s city treasurer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:23\">16:23</a>). There is an inscription (a writing carved in the stone pavement) next to the large theater in Corinth. The inscription states that Erastus, the city treasurer, placed it there, in appreciation for his election. It seems that Erastus remained in Corinth because it was his home (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:20\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:20</a>). </p><p>Also, when Paul wrote this letter, he was staying with a man named Gaius (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:23\">Romans 16:23</a>). This was likely the same Gaius who lived in Corinth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:14\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:14</a>). A woman named Phoebe probably carried the letter to Rome. She was a deaconess who served in the church at Cenchrea, which was Corinth&apos;s eastern port (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:1\">Romans 16:1</a>).</p><h2>When Was the Letter Written?</h2><p>We can determine when Paul wrote this letter by examining what he says in it, such as references to people, events, and his travels. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:23-Rom15:28\">Romans 15:23–28</a>, Paul indicates that he was about to visit Jerusalem. He was taking money that the churches in Macedonia and Achaia had collected for the poor Christians there. After this, he planned to visit Rome on his way to Spain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:23-Rom15:28\">15:23–28</a>). He took this money with him from Corinth at the end of his third three-month visit to that city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:2,Acts20:23\">Acts 20:2, 23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:17\">24:17</a>). </p><p>Some people traveled with Paul from Corinth at this time. The book of Acts lists their names (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">20:4</a>). Four of these people were with Paul when he wrote this letter: Timothy, Sosipater, Gaius, and Erastus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:21,Rom16:23\">Romans 16:21, 23</a>). Paul visited Jerusalem around AD 57–58. So, Paul wrote this letter around that same time.</p><h2>What Is the Background of the Letter?</h2><p>During his second missionary journey, Paul visited Corinth and started a church there. He stayed in the city for 18 months (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:1,Acts18:11\">Acts 18:1, 11</a>). He arrived at the same time as Priscilla and Aquila, who had recently come from Rome. After Paul had been in Corinth for 18 months, he was brought before the new proconsul (governor) Gallio (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:12\">Acts 18:12</a>). We know when this happened because archaeologists found an inscription about Gallio at Delphi that shows he became governor in the spring of AD 51. This means Paul must have arrived in Corinth in the winter of AD 49.</p><p>After leaving Corinth, Paul went back to Antioch to report on his work. Then he began his final journey to collect money from the non-Jewish (gentile) churches for the poor in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:25-Rom15:29\">Romans 15:25–29</a>). He had planned this collection earlier (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:1\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor9:5\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 9:5</a>). Paul had to return to Corinth because of ongoing problems there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:11\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:1\">7:1</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:1\"> </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:3\">Acts 20:3</a>). This is when he wrote the letter to the Romans. The last two chapters show that Paul planned to take the money to Jerusalem soon, and then travel to Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:23-Rom15:24\">Romans 15:23–24</a>). </p><p>He wrote this letter to tell the Romans he was coming, so they could help him continue his journey to Spain (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:24,Rom15:28\">Romans 15:24, 28</a>). Unlike most other churches, Paul did not start the churches in Rome or Colossae. This is why his letter does not mention any specific problems among the Roman Christians.</p><h2>Who Were the People Receiving the Letter?</h2><p>The church in Rome had both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians. The church probably started when some Jewish believers who were in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost became Christians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:10\">Acts 2:10</a>). They were among the 3,000 people who believed in Jesus that day. Some of these new believers likely took the good news about Jesus back to Rome. Some of the Christians Paul greets in his letter may have been following Jesus for many years. They might have been among the first people to become Christians. Until Paul arrived, the Roman church probably grew through its own members sharing their faith, with occasional help from visiting teachers.</p><p>The good news about Jesus had clearly spread to gentiles, since there were non-Jewish believers in the Roman church. We can see this from what Paul says throughout his letter. In fact, Paul writes to them as if most of the church members were gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:13,Rom1:15\">Romans 1:13, 15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:15-Rom15:16\">15:15–16</a>). Many of these non-Jewish members were probably “God-fearing” non-Jewish people who followed Jewish religious practices but had not fully converted to Judaism (like Cornelius in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:2\">Acts 10:2</a>).</p><h2>Why Was the Letter Written? </h2><p>This is Paul&apos;s most detailed and passionate letter. It reads like both a careful teaching document and a personal, heartfelt letter. The main message throughout is that both Jews and gentiles have failed to live up to God&apos;s standards and need to be saved (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:31\">Romans 3:21–31</a>). God has shown his way of making people right with him to everyone—not just to Jewish people. This is because God is the God of all people, since there is only one God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:29\">3:29</a>). He makes Jewish people right with himself through Jesus&apos;s death on the cross. He does the same for non-Jewish people, keeping his promise to Abraham (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:30\">30</a>). Both groups can receive God&apos;s blessing through their faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:2\">5:2</a>). This good news is for Jewish people first, and also for Greeks (which Paul uses to mean all non-Jewish people; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:16\">1:16</a>).</p><h2>What Does the Letter Teach About God?</h2><p>Once a person believes in Jesus, that person is justified before God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom3:31\">Romans 1–3</a>). This means that God accepts them as right with him. This new relationship with God gives believers a new life through Jesus and makes them part of God&apos;s people (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom8:39\">4–8</a>). These chapters are the most complex part of the letter. They explain deep truths about God&apos;s endless kindness, his supreme love, and his mysterious plans for people.</p><p>After this, Paul speaks about how non-Jewish people are becoming part of God&apos;s family. He explains that even though many Jews did not believe in Jesus, some remained faithful. He says that one day, all of God&apos;s true people (both Jews and gentiles) will be united as one church on earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36\">Romans 9–11</a>). </p><p>In the next sections, Paul explains how these teachings should change how Christians live and work together (chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom15:33\">12–15</a>). The letter ends with Paul&apos;s personal greetings to various Christians in Rome (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27\">16</a>).</p><h2>What Is the Message of the Letter?</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:17\">Romans 1:17 </a>states the main message of the first eight chapters: “<span>The righteous will live by faith.</span>” Paul quotes these words from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:4\">Habakkuk 2:4</a> to show that being made right with God through faith was always part of God&apos;s plan. It was taught by the Old Testament prophets. What was new in Paul&apos;s teaching was that gentiles could become part of God&apos;s family alongside Jewish people by believing in Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph3:5-Eph3:6\">Ephesians 3:5–6</a>). Some Jewish Christians said that gentiles had to convert to Judaism first to be accepted by God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts15:1\">Acts 15:1</a>). But Paul explained in Ephesians that God&apos;s plan was to accept both groups through their faith in Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph3:6\">Ephesians 3:6</a>).</p><p>The first part of the letter explains how people are made right with God through faith. The first three chapters show that both Jews and gentiles have sinned, and that Jesus&apos;s work of saving people applies to both groups (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:22\">Romans 3:21–22</a>). Chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:25\">4</a> shows that Abraham is the spiritual father of all who believe in God—both Jewish and non-Jewish people.</p><p>Then in chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom8:39\">5–8</a>, Paul explains how people who have been made right with God should live by faith. Anyone (whether Jew or gentile) who accepts what God did through Jesus&apos;s death on the cross will be free from:</p><ul><li><p>The wrath of God (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:21\">5</a>)</p></li><li><p>The power of sin (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23\">6</a>)</p></li><li><p>The binding power of the law (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:1-Rom7:25\">7</a>)</p></li><li><p>The power of death (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:39\">8</a>)</p></li></ul><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36\">Romans 9–11</a>, Paul discusses the nation of Israel “according to the flesh” (physical Jews) in relation to the future purpose of God. He concludes that God has not rejected his people who came from Abraham&apos;s family line (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:2\">11:1–2</a>). Using the picture of a tree, Paul explains that God can bring them back into his family if they accept Jesus as their promised savior (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:23\">23</a>).</p><p>In the final chapters (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom16:27\">12–16</a>), Paul explains how the teachings from the first 11 chapters should affect how Christians live each day. He ends by reminding readers how important it is that gentiles have come to God through his ministry (chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:1-Rom15:33\">15</a>).</p><h3>In Detail</h3><p>In the first chapter, Paul argues that pagan gentiles were rebelling against God. God had revealed his wrath against their evil ways (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:18\">Romans 1:18</a>). God had given them enough evidence of his existence through the natural world. But they still chose to worship many gods and idols instead, which led to immoral behavior (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:20-Rom1:23\">20–23</a>). Three times, Paul says that “God <span>gave them over in the desires of their hearts</span>” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:24\">24</a>). This included:</p><ul><li><p> “dishonorable passions” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:26\">26</a>),</p></li><li><p>“a depraved mind” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:28\">28</a>), and </p></li><li><p>doing “<span>what ought not to be done</span>” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:28\">28</a>). </p></li></ul><p>This means that God allowed their sins to continue as an act of divine judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:25\">3:25</a>). He did not punish their lack of understanding about him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:30\">Acts 17:30</a>). He did not stop them from worshiping false gods (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:42\">7:42</a>).</p><p>The Jewish people were not much better. They had received God&apos;s law through Moses, which showed God&apos;s will for their nation, but they had not obeyed it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:17-Rom2:29\">Romans 2:17–29</a>). Even the gentiles, who do not have the law, sometimes do by nature what the law requires. They show that the law is “<span>written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending the</span>m” (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:14-Rom2:15\">14–15</a>). For a Jew, obeying the law was not enough. They had to obey because they truly wanted to, not just because it was required (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:29\">29</a>). </p><p>Some gentiles respected God and followed the main teachings of his laws. They became examples that showed how wrong it was when Jewish people did not obey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom2:14,Rom2:27\">Romans 2:14, 27</a>). Even though God&apos;s chosen people failed to be faithful, this did not stop God from keeping his promise to Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:3\">3:3</a>). The Jewish people had many advantages over non-Jewish people, but this did not help them because both groups had surrendered to sin (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:1,Rom3:9\">1, 9</a>). The situation now was that “<span>all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God</span>” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:23\">23</a>).</p><p>So, God sent Jesus to redeem the world from its sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:31\">Romans 3:21–31</a>). God has revealed his righteousness apart from the law through &quot;faith in Jesus Christ&quot; (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:22\">22</a>). Bible scholars and translators have two different ways of understanding this phrase:</p><ol><li><p>&quot;Faith in Jesus Christ&quot; (also called the objective genitive view): This view understands the phrase to mean our faith, with Christ as the object of that faith. It means we are saved by believing in Jesus and what he has done for us. Most English Bible translations use this understanding.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Faith of Jesus Christ&quot; (also called the subjective genitive view): This view sees the phrase as referring to Jesus&apos;s own faithfulness to God. It means Jesus was faithful in following God&apos;s plan and carrying out his mission, even to the point of death on the cross. Under this view, we are saved through Christ&apos;s faithful obedience to God.</p></li></ol><p>Many scholars today think both meanings might be intended, showing how Jesus&apos;s faithfulness and our faith work together in God&apos;s plan of salvation. Both views agree that &quot;faith of Christ&quot; or &quot;faith in Christ&quot; is available to everyone, both Jews and non-Jews, based on their trust in God. </p><p>The law is “holy, righteous, and good” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:12\">7:12</a>). But, this righteousness was not available only through obeying the commandments of the law. This would make God only the God of the Jews, since God gave the law specifically to the Jewish people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:29\">3:29</a>). </p><p>But God is also the God of the gentiles. He makes everyone right with himself through Jesus Christ. According to the Greek text of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:22\">Romans 3:22</a>, this righteousness comes to &quot;all who are faithful&quot; or &quot;continue in the faith.&quot; So, the righteousness of God <span>comes through faith in (or the faithfulness of) Jesus Christ </span>(verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:3,Rom3:22\">3, 22</a>). It provides the basis of salvation for everyone who believes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:9\">5:9</a>).</p><p>Several times in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:1-Rom4:25\">chapter 4</a>, Paul emphasizes that Abraham was the father of the Jews and of the gentiles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:11-Rom4:12\">Romans 4:11–12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:16-Rom4:18\">16–18</a>). God promised Abraham that through his descendants, all nations (gentiles) would be blessed. Abraham was justified by faith, and this promise extends to all who share the same faith (both Jews and gentiles). The faithfulness of Jesus Christ made this possible, and it is for all who believe and remain faithful (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom4:11\">11</a>).</p><p>Paul explained an important truth about God&apos;s plan. He taught that when people trust in Jesus Christ, they are made right with God. This is called justification. Christians have understood justification in three main ways:</p><ul><li><p>Some understand justification as God declaring believers righteous through faith in Christ. According to this view, justification is a legal declaration. Christ’s righteousness is imputed (credited) to believers</p></li><li><p>Some understand justification as God making people truly righteous through his grace, which transforms their lives. According to this view, justification includes both God’s declaration and an inner transformation through grace and good works. Righteousness is infused (poured into) believers, especially through baptism and the other sacraments (means of grace), which enable this transformative process.</p></li><li><p>Some understand justification as part of the larger process of salvation, where believers are united with God in a deep, transformative way. In this view, justification is not just a legal declaration or internal transformation but a full participation in God’s divine life (called theosis). Believers are gradually transformed into the likeness of God, experiencing a deep, ongoing union with him.</p></li></ul><p>All agree that through Jesus, believers are saved from God&apos;s judgment against sin and find peace with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:1,Rom5:9\">Romans 5:1, 9</a>). </p><p>Sin entered the world through the first sin and death came to all people (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:12\">12</a>). Yet, justification came through the second Adam, Jesus. He gives salvation to those who are faithful and receive the abundance of his grace (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:16-Rom5:18\">16–18</a>).</p><p>The law was not meant to save the Jew. “It was added because of transgressions” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:19\">Galatians 3:19</a>). It served to make all types of people more aware of sin. “<span>The law came in so that the trespass would increase</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:20\">Romans 5:20</a>). Sin used the law to deceive and destroy those who tried to obey it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:11\">7:11</a>). </p><p>Paul had known what it was to covet (wanting things that belong to others) before he knew the law. When he turned 12 or 13 years old, he became responsible for following the law and its requirements. The command that said “do not covet” showed Paul how much the law required of him, and this understanding brought him great distress (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:11\">7:11</a>). Once people knew what the law required, they were fully responsible for obeying it. Sin became even more serious because now it meant breaking God&apos;s law that people knew about.</p><p>This situation made people need God&apos;s grace even more. As the Bible says, “<span>where sin increased, grace increased all the more</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:20\">Romans 5:20</a>). Some argued that they should “<span>continue in sin so that grace may increase.</span>” But this idea completely misunderstands what it means to be free from God&apos;s anger, free from the law, free from sin, and free from death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:1\">6:1</a>). </p><p>Paul explains that people who have been made right with God and saved from sin by Jesus have died to sin&apos;s power. Sin can no longer control them like a master controls a slave (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:2,Rom6:6\">2, 6</a>). The main point is that sin and Satan cannot rule over people who believe in Jesus (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:9,Rom6:14\">9, 14</a>). Sin cannot be their master (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:12\">12</a>). Sin cannot make them its slaves (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:17,Rom6:20\">17, 20</a>).</p><p>People who are right with God are free from three things:</p><ul><li><p>They are free from God&apos;s judgment against sin.</p></li><li><p>They are free from the demands of the law. </p></li><li><p>They are free from the control of sin.</p></li></ul><p>Through Jesus&apos;s faithful obedience, God freed these people from death. God promises to give new life to their physical bodies through his Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:2,Rom8:11\">Romans 8:2, 11</a>). If people live according to their selfish desires (“according to the flesh”), they will face death. But if they let the Holy Spirit guide their lives, they will experience true freedom and life (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:6-Rom8:13\">6–13</a>). Not even death will be able to separate them from the love of God in Jesus Christ (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:38-Rom8:39\">38–39</a>). The Holy Spirit guides them and helps them when they are weak. Both the Holy Spirit and Jesus intercede for them (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:14,Rom8:26,Rom8:34\">14, 26, 34</a>).</p><p>Paul does not discuss how to apply&nbsp;these theological principles until <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:21\">Romans 12</a>. In chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36\">9–11</a>, he explains how and why the Jews rejected Jesus the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one). How could the Jewish people reject Jesus when God had worked so closely with them for so long? They had a special relationship with God that was different from all other people on earth. Paul explores this difficult question in chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom11:36\">9–11</a>.</p><p>Paul gives four reasons why the Jews rejected Jesus the Messiah: </p><ol><li><p>God chose Israel on purpose, knowing what would happen in the future. These were physical descendants of Israel <span>who enjoyed all the special relationships to God that a chosen people could experience: </span></p><ul><li><p><span>They were God&apos;s children.</span></p></li><li><p><span>They experienced God&apos;s glory.</span></p></li><li><p><span>They received God&apos;s covenants (special agreements).</span></p></li><li><p><span>They received God&apos;s law. </span></p></li><li><p><span>They learned how to worship God.</span></p></li><li><p><span>They received God&apos;s promises.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The came from the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob).</span></p></li><li><p>They were the people from whom Jesus came <span> </span>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:1-Rom9:5\">Romans 9:1–5)</a>. </p></li></ul><p>God had chosen them like he had chosen Jacob over Esau before either was born. This was like how God made Pharaoh stubborn (“hardened” his heart), or how a potter shapes clay into whatever kind of pot he wants to make (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:6-Rom9:26\">9:6–26</a>). </p><p>God did not choose them because of anything they had done or not done. He chose them because he had a special purpose for them.</p><p>This does not mean God was unjust. He needed to show his power through the Jewish people so that everyone on earth would know about him. God chose Israel to serve his purposes, just as he had chosen Pharaoh, Jacob, and Moses. These people were saved because they had faith in God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:40\">Hebrews 11</a>). </p></li><li><p>Israel rejected Jesus the Messiah and his gospel. Paul argues that this follows a pattern that appears again and again throughout history (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom10:21\">Romans 9:30–10:21</a>). The Jewish people tried to be right with God by following rules instead of having faith in him. Because of this, they did not recognize the righteousness that comes through faith. They based their righteousness on the law and so they &quot;stumbled over&quot; their own Messiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:30-Rom9:33\">9:30–33</a>). They rejected Jesus as Messiah and misunderstood how people are made right with God.</p></li><li><p>He says that some Jewish people (a small group called a &quot;remnant&quot;) have already believed the good news about Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:16,Rom11:26\">Romans 11:1–16, 26</a>). This shows that one day, many more Jewish people will also believe. Even though Paul says God has rejected Israel for now, this rejection is not permanent or final.</p><p>Paul uses a picture of an olive tree to explain this. He says God has broken Israel off from the tree of Abraham&apos;s promise for a time. But God has not completely rejected his people. The remnant who believed got what they were looking for, but the others were made stubborn for a while. God did this so they would become jealous when they saw non-Jewish people being welcomed into God&apos;s kingdom. This means that Israel&apos;s separation from God does not have to last forever.</p></li><li><p>Paul says God used Israel&apos;s rejection of Jesus to bring good things. When the Jewish people rejected Jesus, this opened the way for non-Jewish people (gentiles) to become part of God&apos;s family. Paul says that if many Jewish people later accept Jesus, it would be as amazing as seeing dead people come back to life! He explains this idea through the rest of the chapter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:17-Rom11:36\">Romans 11:17–36</a>). </p><p>Paul warns the gentiles not to be proud about this. The Jewish people stumbled so that the gentiles could be included in God&apos;s plan (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:17-Rom11:19\">17–19</a>). Israel did not “<span>stumble so as to fall beyond recovery</span>” (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:11\">11</a>). Their “fall” was a blessing to gentiles and was a part of God&apos;s plan. Paul uses the picture of an olive tree again. He says God broke off the Jewish people from the tree because they did not believe. But God can put them back on the tree if they start believing in Jesus.</p></li></ol><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom16:27\">Romans 12–16</a>, Paul explains how Christians should live based on all he has taught before. Paul begins by saying, “<span>Therefore I urge you</span>…” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1\">12:1</a>). He then lists many Christian virtues and responsibilities. Paul often gives this kind of advice in his letters. He wants to help new believers understand how to live as Christians, whether they came from a Jewish or non-Jewish background.</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:14\">Romans 13</a> focuses on how Christians in Rome should relate to government officials. Paul teaches that God establishes civil government, and Christians should recognize civil government has a right to exist even if those who are in power are corrupt. These officials serve God by punishing those who do wrong (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:4\">13:4</a>). </p><p>In chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:1-Rom14:23\">14</a>, Paul addresses how Christians should treat each other when they disagree about certain practices, like eating certain foods. He teaches that:</p><ul><li><p>Christians who feel free to do these things (because of their freedom in Christ) should not pressure others to act against their own conscience.</p></li><li><p>Christians who avoid these things should not judge those who do them.</p></li><li><p>Everyone should show love and respect to each other, which shows they are true followers of Jesus.</p></li></ul><p>In chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:1-Rom15:33\">15</a>, Paul shares his travel plans and explains his special role. He sees himself as a priestly minister serving the gentiles. He plans to take money collected from gentile churches to Jerusalem as a special offering to God, showing how the gentiles have become believers.</p><p>Chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:27\">16</a> closes in the typical way with greetings and recommendations from different individuals. He mentions 27 people by name, showing his deep connection with the Roman church community.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6782\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Paul, The Apostle</span>.</p>",
