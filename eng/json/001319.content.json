    "content": "<h1>CITIES OF THE PLAIN</h1><p>A group of five cities located in the plain or basin of the Jordan River was also known as the “cities of the valley.” This region was very fertile, which attracted Abraham’s nephew Lot when the need to separate their large flocks and herds arose (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:10-Gen13:12\">Genesis 13:10–12</a>). These cities are named: </p><ul><li><p>Sodom</p></li><li><p>Gomorrah</p></li><li><p>Admah</p></li><li><p>Zeboiim</p></li><li><p>Bela (later known as Zoar)</p></li></ul><p>Each of these cities was likely a city-state, meaning they had their own kings.</p><p>These cities play a significant role in the Bible in four key ways:</p><ol><li><p>The region offered a place where Lot could settle, and he eventually chose to live in Sodom.</p></li><li><p>The five kings of these cities fought against a stronger force led by four kings from distant lands in the east. They were defeated, and their cities were looted. The invaders took a lot of goods and captives, including women and children (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1-Gen14:24\">Genesis 14</a>). Lot was among those captured, which led Abraham to launch a successful rescue mission. He recovered Lot, the other captives, and the stolen goods.</p></li><li><p>The cities later received God&apos;s judgment. Their sinfulness was so severe that even Abraham’s intercession could not save them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:22-Gen18:33\">Genesis 18:22–33</a>). Their evil is highlighted by the story of the mob in Sodom attempting to harm Lot’s guests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:38\">Genesis 19</a>). Soon after, Lot and his family were warned to flee before the cities were destroyed. Brimstone and fire rained down, wiping out the cities and drastically altering the landscape.</p></li><li><p>The destruction of these cities is mentioned in many other parts of the Old and New Testaments as a warning of divine punishment for sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa3:9\">Isaiah 3:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer50:40\">Jeremiah 50:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek16:46-Ezek16:56\">Ezekiel 16:46–56</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:15\">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom9:29\">Romans 9:29</a>).</p></li></ol>",
