The Assyrians relocated the people of Sepharvaim in Samaria after 722 BC. </p><p>Anammelech is the Hebrew rendering of the name for a Mesopotamian deity, Anu-melek. The name means “Anu is King.” Anu was the name of the chief god of Assyria, the sky god. </p><p>The Sepharvites in Samaria included child sacrifice as a part of their worship of Anu-melek (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:31\">2&nbsp;Kings 17:31</a>). The burning of children in the Anu cult may have been brought from Sepharvaim or it may have been something new that developed when the Sepharvites came to Canaan.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6257\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Mesopotamia</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7853\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Syria, Syrians</span>.</p>",
