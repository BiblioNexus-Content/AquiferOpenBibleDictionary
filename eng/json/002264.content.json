This was commonly done by the Philistines, Amorites, Babylonians, and other nations that surrounded Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg16:21\">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:7\">2&nbsp;Kings 25:7</a>). People would gouge out eyes not only to disable their enemies or prisoners but also to bring extreme shame and disgrace upon them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam11:2\">1&nbsp;Samuel 11:2</a>). </p><p>The Israelites seem to have known about gouging from their time in Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:14\">Numbers 16:14</a>). But there is no evidence that it was a common practice in Israel.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3861\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Criminal Law and Punishment</span>.</p>",
