In Judea and other smaller provinces of the Roman Empire, the procurator sometimes acted as the governor of that region.</p><p>A procurator not only managed finances but also had judicial and military authority. His main responsibility was keeping peace in his jurisdiction. The New Testament&nbsp;mentions three Roman procurators:</p><ul><li><p>Pontius Pilate was procurator from AD 26–36 (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:1-Matt27:66\">Matthew&nbsp;27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:1-John19:42\">John 18–19</a>).</p></li><li><p>Antonius Felix was procurator from AD 52–59 (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:24-Acts25:14\">Acts 23:24–25:14</a>). </p></li><li><p>Porcius Festus was procurator from AD 59–62 (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:27-Acts26:32\">Acts 24:27–26:32</a>) .</p></li></ul><p>These administrators were accountable and subordinate to the governor of Syria.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4417\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Felix, Antonius</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4422\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Festus, Porcius</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6902\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pilate, Pontius</span>.</p>",
