Harmon occurs only once in the Bible, and there is no known place with such a name. There are problems with the text and numerous emendations have been proposed. Some Hebrew manuscripts render it as a common noun, meaning “palace” (kjv), rather than a proper name. The Septuagint renders it “the mountain of Rimmon,” perhaps referring to a hill east of Rimmon (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:45-Judg20:47\">Jgs 20:45–47</a>; cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:32\">Jos 15:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:13\">19:13</a>).</p>",
