    "content": "<h1>JOHANAN BEN ZAKKAI*</h1><p>Leading Jewish sage at the end of the second temple period. His place of birth is not known; he went to Jerusalem to study, and after 18 years there spent some time in Galilee. Later, he returned to Jerusalem and taught “in the shadow of the temple.” He encouraged the Pharisees among the priesthood rather than the Sadducees. During the siege of Jerusalem, he managed to leave, in a coffin according to one version. He was a prisoner of Vespasian, probably in AD 68, who gave him permission to settle in Jamnia. There he began quietly to lay the groundwork for the survival of Judaism without its temple.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5646\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judaism</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6864\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pharisees</span>.</p>",
