Megiddo is located between the western coastal area and the broad plain of Jezreel in northern Palestine. </p><p>The area of Megiddo was important commercially and militarily. Many important battles in Israel’s history took place in Megiddo:</p><ul><li><p>There the Lord routed Sisera before the armies of&nbsp;Deborah and Barak (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 4–5</a>).</p></li><li><p>Gideon was victorious over the Midianites and Amalekites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:1-Judg7:25\">Judges 6–7</a>).</p></li><li><p>King Saul and his army were defeated by the Philistines (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam31:1-1Sam31:13\">1&nbsp;Samuel 31</a>).</p></li><li><p>King Josiah was slain in battle by the Egyptian army of Pharaoh Neco (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:29\">2&nbsp;Kings 23:29</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Because of that long history, the name Armageddon has become symbolic of a battlefield. </p><h2>Armageddon in the Book of Revelation</h2><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev15:1-Rev15:8\">Revelation 15</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev16:1-Rev16:21\">16</a> describe seven angels who pour out seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth. The&nbsp;sixth angel pours out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its waters are dried up (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev16:12-Rev16:16\">Revelation 16:12–16</a>). This action prepares the way for the coming of the &quot;kings of the&nbsp;East.&quot;</p><p>Three demonic spirits go forth to cause the&nbsp;kings of the whole world to gather for a battle on the great day of God the Almighty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev16:13-Rev16:14\">Revelation 16:13–14</a>). Their gathering takes place at Armageddon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev16:16\">Revelation 16:16</a>). <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7187\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Revelation, Book of</span>.</p>",
