    "content": "<h1>MELCHIZEDEK</h1><p>A mysterious biblical figure whose name means “king of righteousness.” Melchizedek was both a priest and a king. We first learn about him in<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:18-Gen14:20\"> Genesis 14:18–20</a>. He is also mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:4\">Psalm 110:4</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb5:10\">Hebrews 5:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:20\">6:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:17\">7:1–17</a>.</p><h2>Melchizedek in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:18-Gen14:20\">Genesis 14:18–20</a></h2><p>King Kedorlaomer and three other kings from Mesopotamia attacked five cities near the Dead Sea. During this battle, they captured Abraham&apos;s nephew Lot, along with his family and everything they owned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1-Gen14:12\">Genesis 14:1–12</a>). Abraham gathered his men and went after the attackers. He defeated them and rescued Lot and his family, bringing back everything that had been taken (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:13-Gen14:16\">Genesis 14:13–16</a>).</p><p>When Abraham returned from the battle, the kings from the Dead Sea region came to thank him. Melchizedek, the king of Salem (which was an early name for Jerusalem), also came to meet Abraham (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps76:2\">Psalm 76:2</a>). Melchizedek brought bread and wine and blessed Abraham. He did this because he was a priest of &quot;God Most High&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:18\">Genesis 14:18</a>). </p><p>The name &quot;God Most High&quot; (<em>’El ‘Elyon</em> in Hebrew) refers to the one true God who created heaven and earth. This was different from the false gods that the Canaanite people worshiped (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:22\">Genesis 14:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps7:17\">Psalms 7:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps47:2\">47:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps57:2\">57:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:56\">78:56</a>). Melchizedek knew that Abraham worshiped this same true God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:22\">Genesis 14:22</a>).</p><p>Melchizedek praised God for helping Abraham win the battle. Abraham showed that he accepted Melchizedek&apos;s role as God&apos;s priest in two ways: he accepted the gifts and blessing from Melchizedek, and he gave Melchizedek one-tenth of everything he had recovered. In contrast, Abraham refused to accept gifts from the king of Sodom because he did not want to be associated with those who worshiped false gods.</p><p>We do not know exactly how Melchizedek came to know the true God. He might have learned about God through stories passed down from the time of Noah&apos;s flood. Or, like Abraham, God might have spoken to him directly and turned him away from worshiping false gods. What we do know from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:3\">Hebrews 7:3 </a>is that Melchizedek was different from other priests. He did not become a priest because his father was a priest, but in some special way that the Bible does not fully explain.</p><h2>Melchizedek in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:4\">Psalm 110:4</a></h2><p>In this psalm, King David wrote about someone greater than himself, someone he called “Lord” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1\">Psalm 11:1</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:35-Mark12:37\">Mark 12:35</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:35-Mark12:37\">37</a>). David was not writing about himself or any other king of his time. He was writing about the promised Messiah who would come in the future. This Messiah would be both God&apos;s Son and a descendant of David.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:4\">Psalm 110:4</a>, David says to the Messiah: “<span>You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</span>” The full meaning of this promise is explained later in the book of Hebrews.</p><h2>Melchizedek in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb5:6-Heb5:11\">Hebrews 5:6–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:20-Heb7:28\">6:20–7:28</a></h2><p>The book of Hebrews explains why Jesus&apos;s role as priest is greater than the priests who came from Aaron&apos;s family. It compares Jesus to Melchizedek to show this. Here are three ways they are similar:</p><ol><li><p>Both Jesus and Melchizedek are &quot;kings of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kings of peace&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb7:2\">Hebrews 7:1–2</a>).</p></li><li><p>Both became priests in a special way, not because they were born into a priestly family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:3\">Hebrews 7:3</a>).</p></li><li><p>Both serve as priests forever (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:3\">Hebrews 7:3</a>).</p></li></ol><p>Melchizedek was greater than Abraham (the father of Levi) because Melchizedek gave gifts to and blessed Abraham, and received tithes from him  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:4-Heb7:10\">Hebrews 7:4–10</a>).  King David wrote that a new kind of priest like Melchizedek would come, showing that the priests who came from Levi&apos;s family could not do everything God&apos;s people needed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:19\">Hebrews 7:11</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:11-Heb7:19\">19</a>). God made a special promise about Jesus being this kind of priest, which God had not done for the Levitical priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22\">Hebrews 7:20</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:20-Heb7:22\">22</a>). Unlike the Levitical priests who died and had to be replaced, this new priesthood would last forever (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:23-Heb7:25\">Hebrews 7:23</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:23-Heb7:25\">25</a>).</p><p>Some Bible scholars have suggested that Melchizedek might have been Jesus appearing in the Old Testament before he was born as a human (this is called a &quot;Christophany&quot;). They think this because <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:3\">Hebrews 7:3</a> says there is no record of Melchizedek&apos;s parents, ancestors, birth, or death.</p><p>However, this verse is better understood to mean that Melchizedek became a priest in a special way. God chose him directly, unlike the Levites who became priests because they were born into certain families. Melchizedek was like a picture or example of what Jesus would be as a priest later.</p><p>The book of Hebrews says that Melchizedek was “<span>like the Son of God</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:3\">Hebrews 7:3</a>). This shows that Melchizedek was similar to Jesus but was not actually Jesus himself.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4927\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hebrews, Letter to the</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>.</p>",
