He is mentioned again as helping Aaron Watch over Israel while Moses was on Mount Sinai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:14\">24:14</a>). According to Josephus, Hur was the husband of Miriam, the sister of Moses (<em>Antiquities</em> 3.2.4).</p></li><li><p>The fourth of the five kings of Midian who was killed with Balaam by the Israelites under Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num31:8\">Numbers 31:8</a>). He is also referred to as one of the “princes of Midian” and “Sihon” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:21\">Joshua 13:21</a>).</p></li><li><p>The father of one of the 12 officers that Solomon chose to provide food for the king’s household (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:8\">1&nbsp;Kings 4:8</a>, “Ben-hur” in Berean Standard Bible).</p></li><li><p>The son of Caleb and Ephrath and the grandfather of Bezalel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:19-1Chr2:20\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:19–20</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod31:2\">Exodus 31:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod38:22\">38:22</a>). Some interpreters regard the Hur in #1 as Bezalel&apos;s grandfather. Others think the Hur who assisted Moses was a different man.</p></li><li><p>The father (or perhaps family name) of Rephaiah, a leader after the exile in Babylon who helped Nehemiah rebuild the Jerusalem wall (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:9\">Nehemiah 3:9</a>).</p></li></ol>",
