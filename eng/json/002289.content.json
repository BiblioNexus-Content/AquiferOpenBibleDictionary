Guardians supervised their charges’ moral conduct and general behavior. Their methods of persuasion varied from physical punishment to shaming. Paul regarded the law of Moses as a &quot;schoolmaster&quot; (King James Version), &quot;custodian&quot; (Revised Standard Version), or &quot;tutor&quot; (New American Standard Bible) to lead us to Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:24-Gal3:25\">Galatians 3:24–25</a>). To return to the law represented a return to childhood.</p>",
