He was one of three civil officers (magistrates) of Bethulia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt6:14-Jdt6:15\">Judith 6:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt10:6\">10:6</a>). When the Assyrians attacked, Charmis and the other leaders said they would wait only a short time for God to rescue them. If nothing happened, they planned to surrender.</p><p>Judith strongly rebuked them. She told them not to limit God or decide how and when He would act (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jdt8:9-Jdt8:27\">8:9–27</a>).</p>",
