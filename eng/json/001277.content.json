An Egyptian list of towns from the time of Thutmose III in the 15th century BC also names it. The site isidentified as Tell el-’Oreimeh on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Archaeologists believe people lived in the town from about 2000 to 900 BC.</p></li><li><p>A district in Naphtali’s territory that included the town mentioned above (#1). Ben-hadad, king of Aram (Syria), conquered it in the early ninth century BC during the reign of Baasha, king of northern Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20\">1&nbsp;Kings 15:20</a>).</p></li><li><p>An early name for the Sea of Galilee (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num34:11\">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:17\">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:2\">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:3\">12:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:27\">13:27</a>). It is uncertain whether the city was named after the sea or the sea after the city. The name means “lyres,” possibly because the sea is shaped like a lyre (a stringed instrument similar to a harp). In New Testament times, the name became Gennesaret (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:1\">Luke 5:1</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7353\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Sea of Galilee</span>.</p></li></ol>",
