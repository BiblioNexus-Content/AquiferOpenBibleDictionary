    "content": "<h1>GOD AS FATHER</h1><p>The Bible describes God as the Father in different ways. As the Creator, He is the Father of all people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal2:10\">Malachi 2:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:28\">Acts 17:28</a>). But in a special way, God is the Father of those who believe in him. He cares for, protects, and guides them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:12-John1:13\">John 1:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:14-Rom8:17\">Romans 8:14–17</a>).</p><p>The relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Son reveals the deepest meaning of God&apos;s fatherhood. At Jesus’s baptism, God spoke from heaven, saying, &quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:17\">Matthew 3:17</a>). Unlike believers, who are God&apos;s children by adoption, Jesus is God&apos;s eternal Son. He said, &quot;I and the Father are one&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:30\">John 10:30</a>). This shows that he shares the same divine nature as the Father. </p><p>Jesus revealed what God the Father is like. He told His disciples, &quot;Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:9\">John 14:9</a>). Jesus always did what pleased his Father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:29\">John 8:29</a>). He taught people about God&apos;s fatherly love. He encouraged his followers to pray to God as &quot;<span>our Father in heaven</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:9\">Matthew 6:9</a>). This prayer (called the Lord&apos;s Prayer) teaches us to trust in God&apos;s care and seek his will.</p><p>Through Jesus, believers can have a close relationship with God as their Father, being brought into God&apos;s family through faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:7\">Galatians 4:4–7</a>).</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4667\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">God, Names of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8096\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Trinity</span>.</p>",
