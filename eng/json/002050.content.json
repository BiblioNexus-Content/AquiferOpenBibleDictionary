These Jews were later released from slavery.</p><p>Pompey found that the Jews followed their religious and national customs so strictly that they were not useful as slaves. This is why they were freed.</p><p>Not all the freedmen returned to Jerusalem. Some stayed in Rome. The Roman writer Pliny described the&nbsp;freedman as a “mean commoner.” </p><p>The name &quot;freedmen&quot; (or &quot;Freed Slaves&quot; in the New Living Translation) comes from a Latin word for a person who was released from slavery, or the son of someone who was once a slave.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5904\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Libertines</span>.</p>",
