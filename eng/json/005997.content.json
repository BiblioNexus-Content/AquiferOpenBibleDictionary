    "content": "<h1>ZIPPORAH</h1><p>The wife of Moses and mother of his sons, Gershom and Eliezer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:21\">Exodus 2:21</a>). Zipporah is listed as the daughter of Reuel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:18\">Exodus 2:18</a>). But, Reuel was probably the father of Hobab, who was the father of Zipporah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:29\">Numbers 10:29</a>; called Jethro in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:1\">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:18\">4:18</a>). So, Reuel would have been Zipporah&apos;s grandfather. </p><p>Zipporah circumcised Gershom to prevent Mosesâ€™ death before his return to Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:25\">Exodus 4:25</a>). Apparently at that point Zipporah and the children left Moses and went back to live with her father, returning later during the time Israel wandered in the wilderness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:2\">Exodus 18:2</a>).</p>",
