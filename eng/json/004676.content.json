    "content": "<h1>RAMOTH-GILEAD</h1><p>City lying in the Transjordan area of Gilead and probably identifiable with Tell Ramith, although the site of Tell el-Husn has also been suggested. Initially, biblical references pertain to Ramoth in Gilead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:43\">Dt 4:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh20:8\">Jos 20:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:38\">21:38</a>), while later it is called Ramoth-gilead. Combined names were used to avoid confusion with cities of the same name in other locations.</p><p>Ramoth-gilead, a possession of the tribe of Gad, first appears in the biblical narrative as one of three Transjordan cities of refuge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:43\">Dt 4:43</a>) later included in the six cities of refuge for all Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh20:8\">Jos 20:8</a>). It was allotted to the Merarites as one of 48 Levitical cities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:38\">21:38</a>) and was most likely located along the King’s Highway, which transversed that area.</p><p>During the time of Solomon, Ramoth-gilead enjoyed a place of prominence as the central city in his sixth administrative district and the residence of Ben-geber, chief officer of that district (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:13\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:13</a>). After the division of the kingdom, this border town was taken by the Arameans and became a site of contention between Israel and Aram. King Ahab’s final battle began with his desire to retake Ramoth-gilead. In seeking to convince his ally Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to support him in this maneuver, he produced many prophets who spoke favorable and victorious words to the king (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:53\">1&nbsp;Kgs 22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr18:1-2Chr18:34\">2&nbsp;Chr 18</a>). Unconvinced, Jehoshaphat inquired of the word of the Lord through Micaiah, a prophet of the Lord, who warned of impending disaster. The message was ignored and Ahab was killed at Ramoth-gilead. Ahab’s son Joram also fought with Aram here and was wounded in battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:29\">2&nbsp;Kgs 8:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr22:6\">2&nbsp;Chr 22:6</a>; also called Ramah). Shortly thereafter, Elisha sent one of the sons of the prophets to Ramoth-gilead, where he anointed Jehu to be king over Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:1-2Kgs9:14\">2&nbsp;Kgs 9:1–14</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3738\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of Refuge</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5900\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Levitical Cities</span>.</p>",
