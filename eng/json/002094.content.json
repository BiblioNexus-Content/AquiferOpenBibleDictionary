He ruled for only a short time, from AD 68 to 69.</p><h2>Rise to Power</h2><p>Galba’s full name was Servius Sulpicius Galba. Before becoming emperor, he had served as a governor in several Roman provinces, including France, Germany, Spain, and Africa. After Nero’s death in AD 68, the emperor’s special military force (called the Praetorian Guard) chose Galba as the new emperor.</p><h2>Galba’s Short Rule</h2><p>Galba was not popular with the army or the people. He tried to save money and avoided the fancy ceremonies that many Romans expected. His actions made people dislike him.</p><p>The Roman army in Germany never fully accepted Galba as their emperor. In AD 69, they withdrew their support and chose another leader, Aulus Vitellius.</p><h2>Galba’s Fall</h2><p>Galba made a serious mistake when he did not choose Marcus Salvius Otho to succeed him. Otho then gained support from the Praetorian Guard. Otho was declared emperor, and Galba was killed. The Roman Senate accepted Otho as the new ruler.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3548\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Caesars, the</span>.</p>",
