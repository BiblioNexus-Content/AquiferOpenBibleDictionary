Antiochus V was king of Syria from 163 to 162 BC. </p><p>In 163 BC, Jerusalem was under attack and surrounded by enemy forces.  So, Antiochus V traveled to Jerusalem with Lysias, his advisor who ruled in his place since Antiochus V was still a child. They went to Jerusalem to help end the attack on the city. Antiochus V eventually made peace with Judas Maccabeus, a Jewish leader who was fighting against Syrian rule.</p><p>After this, Antiochus V returned to Antioch, the capital city of Syria. There, his cousin Demetrius I, who also wanted to be king, betrayed him. In 162 BC, both the young king Antiochus V and his regent Lysias were killed.</p>",
