In the context of the Bible, the term refers to a figure who guides and instructs students, helping them understand and follow the rules until they are ready to learn on their own. This idea symbolizes how the law served to prepare people for the coming of Jesus. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3889\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Custodian</span>.</p>",
