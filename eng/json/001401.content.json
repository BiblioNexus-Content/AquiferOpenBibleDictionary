    "content": "<h1>CORIANDER</h1><p>An annual herb native to Palestine. The fragrant seeds of this plant are mentioned twice in the description of manna (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:31\">Exodus 16:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:7\">Numbers 11:7</a>). The references in these verses clearly refer to the common coriander plant (<em>Coriandrum sativum</em>).</p><p>Coriander was commonly found growing alongside grain in cultivated fields throughout Israel and the surrounding areas. It also grows wild in Egypt. Ancient people used it both as a food flavoring and as medicine. The leaves have a strong, pleasant smell and are used in soups and for flavoring puddings, curries, and wines.</p><p>Arabs still use coriander as a spice today. In the Bible, it is mentioned only when describing manna, which was said to look like coriander seeds in size, shape, and color.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4454\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Food and Food Preparation</span>.</p>",
