    "content": "<h1>PIGEON</h1><p>A pigeon or dove is a bird from the pigeon family (<em>Columbidae</em>). People often use the two names in the same way. For example, the common city pigeon comes from the wild rock dove. In the Bible, English translations use both words for the same Hebrew term. A second Hebrew term is usually translated “turtledove.” The ancient Hebrews seemed to know there were different kinds of doves.</p><p>Today, at least six kinds of pigeons or doves live in Israel: </p><ul><li><p>the rock, ring, and stock doves (genus <em>Columba</em>), and </p></li><li><p>the turtle, collared, and palm doves (genus <em>Streptopelia</em>). </p></li></ul><p>The rock dove (<em>Columba livia</em>) and the turtledove (<em>Streptopelia turtur</em>) are mentioned most often in the Bible.</p><p>Pigeons are 15–30 centimeters (6–12 inches) long. The rock dove is the most colorful kind in Israel. It is often silvery gray, with greenish wings that shine in the light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps68:13\">Psalm 68:13</a>). The smaller doves are mostly gray or light brown, with a dark half collar on the back of the neck. Pigeons have short necks, small heads, round bodies, and short wings. These wings are strong, so pigeons can fly far. Smaller doves have longer tails.</p><p>Wild rock doves live mainly near the Sea of Galilee and in ravines near the Dead Sea. They make their nests on cliffs and rocks (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:14\">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:28\">Jeremiah 48:28</a>). All doves in Israel make fragile nests from small pieces of plants. They usually lay two eggs, twice a year. Both parents feed the young. They eat seeds and weeds. Parents make “pigeon’s milk” (soft, partly digested food) in their crops and feed it to the chicks.</p><p>Male doves often compete for mates. The turtledove’s courtship flight is very beautiful. Doves care for their mates and their young. Because of this, people have long used the dove as a sign of love and peace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:15\">Song of Solomon 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:14\">2:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:1\">4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song5:2\">5:2</a>).</p><p>Ancient writers knew pigeons and turtledoves were different. Pigeons live in Israel all year and are easy to tame. Turtledoves are wild and visit only in the spring (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:12\">Song of Solomon 2:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer8:7\">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). People kept turtledoves in cages as pets or for sacrifices. Pigeons may have been the first birds humans kept, possibly even in Noah’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen8:8-Gen8:12\">Genesis 8:8–12</a>). In New Testament times, many pigeon houses (dovecotes) were near Herod the Great’s palace in Jerusalem.</p><h2>Pigeons in Bible Times</h2><p>People valued doves and pigeons as gentle birds, as food, and for sacrifices. Turtledoves may have been seen as more special for sacrifice because they were harder to get. The Bible often mentions them in offerings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:7-Gen15:10\">Genesis 15:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:14\">Leviticus 1:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev5:7\">5:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev12:6\">12:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num6:10\">Numbers 6:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:24\">Luke 2:24</a>). Other passages describe their:</p><ul><li><p>moaning sound (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa38:14\">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa59:11\">59:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek7:16\">Ezekiel 7:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah2:7\">Nahum 2:7</a>), </p></li><li><p>flight (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps55:6\">Psalm 55:6</a>), </p></li><li><p>beauty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:15\">Song of Solomon 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:1\">4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song5:12\">5:12</a>), </p></li><li><p>gentleness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:16\">Matthew 10:16</a>), and </p></li><li><p>loyalty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:9\">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>). </p></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos7:11\">Hosea 7:11</a> uses the dove as a picture of being too trusting.</p><p>At Jesus’s baptism, the Holy Spirit came down like a dove (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:16\">Matthew 3:16</a>). Early Christians connected the dove with the Holy Spirit and the comfort the Spirit gives. The dove is still a common sign of the Holy Spirit today.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3418\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Birds</span>.</p>",
