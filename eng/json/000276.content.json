    "content": "<h1>AMALEK, AMALEKITES</h1><h2>Where Did the Amalekites Come From and Where Did They Live?</h2><p>Amalek was the son of Eliphaz by his concubine, Timna (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:12\">Genesis 36:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:36\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:36</a>). Eliphaz was Esau’s son. Amalek was the chief of Edom. His children were known as Amalekites. They settled in the Negev Desert and became allies of the Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, Ishmaelites, and Midianites. The Amalekites were enemies of Israel. Amalek was part of the brotherly battle that began with his grandfather Esau. Esau fought with Jacob. Since Jacob was one of the fathers of Israel, the conflict between Amalek and Israel had both a theological and political basis.</p><p>The Amalekites did not live in one area for long but moved from place to place. At times, their land in the Negev ranged from south of Beersheba to the southeast as far as Elath and Ezion-geber. They fought westward into the coastal plain, eastward into the Arabah wastelands, and possibly over into Arabia. In the Negev, they blocked the path of the Israelites during the exodus out of Egpyt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:16\">Exodus 17:8–16</a>).</p><h2>Conflicts with Israel</h2><p>Israel’s first encounter with the warriors of Amalek came at Rephidim near Sinai. Moses stood on top of a hill and held up the rod of God until Israel won the battle. He built an altar and named it “The Lord Is My Banner” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:1,Exod17:8-Exod17:16\">Exodus 17:1, 8–16</a>). The Amalekites attacked the Israelites who walked slower than the rest of the group during Israel’s desert wanderings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:17-Deut25:18\">Deuteronomy 25:17–18</a>). When the Israelites reached the promised land&apos;s boundary, they rejected Caleb and Joshua’s report. The unbelieving Israelites attacked the Amalekites and lost (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num14:39-Num14:45\">Numbers 14:39–45</a>).</p><p>When King Balak of Moab called Balaam to curse Israel, he turned his curse upon Moab. In his last divine message, he predicted the end of Amalek’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num24:20\">Numbers 24:20</a>). In his farewell speech, Moses reminded the children of Israel that Amalek’s people had attacked them. He told them to remove all memory of the name Amalek (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut25:17-Deut25:19\">Deuteronomy 25:17–19</a>).</p><p>During the period of the judges, the Amalekites continued to live in their traditional area. They became connected with the Kenites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:5-1Sam15:6\">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:5–6</a>). The Kenites are the descendants of Moses’s father-in-law. He lived in the Negev south of Arad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:16\">Judges 1:16</a>). The Amalekites were still related to other nomadic tribes or groups of people who moved from place to place such as the Moabites, Ammonites, and Midianites. </p><p>Eglon was the king of Moab. Eglon got these nomadic tribes to unite to defeat Israel and seize Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:12-Judg3:14\">Judges 3:12–14</a>). The Song of Deborah cites Amalek as one of a group of tribes against Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:14\">Judges 5:14</a>). The name is omitted by many modern translations. Some translations translate &quot;Amalek&quot; as “into the valley” (Revised Standard Version). However, the Amalekite attacks is referred to in other passages of the time of Deborah and Barak (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:3,Judg6:33\">Judges 6:3, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:12\">7:12</a>). Gideon defeated the group (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:12-Judg7:25\">Judges 7:12–25</a>). There is no evidence that the Amalekites were driven out of the Negev.</p><h2>The Decline and Defeat of the Amalekites</h2><p>According to 1&nbsp;Samuel, Saul sent his armies out against the Amalekites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47-1Sam14:48\">14:47–48</a>). God commanded him to destroy them and everything they owned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam15:3\">15:1–3</a>). He did attack their city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:4-1Sam15:7\">15:4–7</a>), but he did not kill their king, Agag (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:8\">15:8</a>). Saul gave the best Amalekite livestock to his men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:9\">15:9</a>). God punished him. He sent Samuel to tell Saul that his kingship was finished because of his sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:10-1Sam15:31\">15:10–31</a>). Samuel then killed Agag (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:32-1Sam15:35\">15:32–35</a>). </p><p>Some Amalekites remained. They must have escaped. They appear later as David’s enemies while he was still a young warrior (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8\">27:8</a>). Some Amalekites took David&apos;s two wives. He rescued them and killed most of the attackers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:20\">30:1–20</a>). </p><p>The Amalekites were Israel’s sworn enemies throughout King David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:1\">2&nbsp;Samuel 1:1</a>). They are listed among the enemies of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:11\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps83:7\">Psalm 83:7</a>). The rest of the Amalekites were killed a few hundred years after David when King Hezekiah ruled the southern kingdom of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:41-1Chr4:43\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:41–43</a>).</p>",
