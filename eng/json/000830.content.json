Benaiah fought in the military, and he became the commander-in-chief of the army during the reign of Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:4\">4:4</a>).</p><p>Before David became king, Benaiah performed a number of daring military and protective feats to become one of the mighty men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22\">22</a>) during David’s flight from King Saul. He became the commander of “the thirty” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr27:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 27:6</a>), a group second only to “the three” of highest valor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:23\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:23</a>). He later had a high place in the armed forces when Joab was commander in chief and led King David’s elite troops, the Cherethites and Pelethites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:18\">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). He was made third in command by David, with 24,000 men under him.

Afterward, he was appointed to serve daily before the ark under Asaph&apos;s direction (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5\">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>).</p></li><li><p>A priestly musician who blew the trumpet before the ark when King David brought it to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr15:24\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 15:24</a>).
