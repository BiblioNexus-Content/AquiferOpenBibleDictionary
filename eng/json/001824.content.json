The city witnessed the defeat of Jabin and Sisera by Barak (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps83:9-Ps83:10\">Ps 83:9â€“10</a>). Endor is best known as the dwelling place of the witch who was called upon by King Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam28:7\">1&nbsp;Sm 28:7</a>). On that occasion, Saul disguised himself because his journey to Endor took him near the Philistine army encamped at Shunem.</p>",
