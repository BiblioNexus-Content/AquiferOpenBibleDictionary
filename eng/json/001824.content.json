Endive grows well in the Middle East and has been cultivated as a food plant in the region for centuries.</p><p>Some scholars suggest that endive may have been among the bitter herbs (<em>merorim</em>) eaten by the Israelites during Passover (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:8\">Exodus 12:8</a>), though the Bible does not specify which plants were used. In ancient times, people ate endive both raw and cooked as a green vegetable.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3428\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bitter Herbs</span>.</p>",
