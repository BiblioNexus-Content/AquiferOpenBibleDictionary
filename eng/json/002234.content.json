    "content": "<h1>GNAT</h1><p>A very small flying insect. The word, used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:24\">Matthew 23:24</a>, is a general word for a small fly. </p><p>The third plague in Egypt before the exodus consisted of gnats (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod8:16-Exod8:18\">Exodus 8:16–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:31\">Psalm 105:31</a>). The King James Version translates the Hebrew word as &quot;lice.&quot; But, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod8:1-Exod8:32\">Exodus 8</a> describes the breeding pattern as insects rising from the dust. This more likely describes gnats rather than lice. </p><p>Since “gnat” is a&nbsp;general term, the small flies of that plague may have included several small species such as mosquitos, harvester gnats, midges, or sand flies.</p><p>The sand fly has a far more painful bite than the mosquito. Further, it does not make a buzzing noise in flight and is so small that it can pass through most mosquito netting.</p><p>Gnats were attracted to wine while it was fermenting. The Pharisees, in particular, would strain their wine to avoid consuming ritually unclean insects (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:24\">Matthew 23:24</a>).</p>",
