    "content": "<h1>MOTH</h1><p>An insect from the <em>Tineola</em> family, that lays its eggs on wool or furs. The larvae feed on those materials. Several biblical passages refer to the destructive qualities of moths (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job13:28\">Job 13:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps39:11\">Psalm 39:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa50:9\">Isaiah 50:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos5:12\">Hosea 5:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:20\">Matthew 6:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:33\">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:2\">James 5:2</a>). </p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa51:8\">Isaiah 51:8,</a> “worm&quot; refers to larvae of the clothes moth. These larvae symbolize decay and weakness. They are the only harmful stage; adults pose no threat and mainly feed on flower nectar. Adults are also easy to crush (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job4:19\">Job 4:19</a>). Clothes moths breed in May or June and enter homes at night. A week after laying eggs, larvae emerge and start damaging animal fiber items.</p><p>Moths quietly destroy things, unlike swarms of insects that block out the sun. In the past, wealth was in possessions, not just money. Wool clothing was especially valuable. So, moths could cause economic disaster. This context highlights Jesus&apos;s words in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:20\">Matthew 6:19–20</a>).</p><p>Palestine has many moth species besides the clothes moth. These moths do not harm plants or seeds. Like the clothes moth, only the larvae cause damage</p>",
