    "content": "<h1>BITTERN</h1><p>A bittern is a long-legged water bird (<em>Botaurus stellaris</em>). It is similar to a heron but has shorter legs and a smaller body.</p><p>Bitterns live in marshes, where they can hide easily. Their brown-and-black feathers look like the plants around them. This camouflage makes them hard to see. Their long neck has soft feathers that make it look thick and heavy.</p><p>Bitterns are shy and usually live alone. In the mating season, they make a deep, strange-sounding call. They also twist their bodies in a special way while calling. Bitterns build their nests alone in grassy marshes.</p><p>Because of their secretive nature, people often think of bitterns as symbols of lonely or empty places.</p><p>There is some question about whether the bittern is actually mentioned in the Bible. The King James Version uses “bittern” in three verses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:23\">Isaiah 14:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa34:11\">34:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:14\">Zephaniah 2:14</a>). The Hebrew word’s meaning is uncertain, so translators sometimes choose very different animals. </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:23\">Isaiah 14:23</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:14\">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, the Revised Standard Version translates it “hedgehog.” In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa34:11\">Isaiah 34:11</a>, the Revised Standard Version has “porcupine.” The Hebrew word is similar to an Arabic word for “porcupine.”</p><p>Other scholars think the verses describe a bird, not a mammal. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zeph2:14\">Zephaniah 2:14</a> says the creature will “<span>roost atop her pillars</span>” (that is, above Nineveh’s doorposts). This would better fit a bird.</p><p>Bitterns live in the swamps of the Tigris River, near the site of Nineveh. Their habits may fit these Bible references better than those of the hedgehog.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3418\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Birds</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4890\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hawk</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4931\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hedgehog</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6804\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Pelican</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Porcupine</span>.</p>",
