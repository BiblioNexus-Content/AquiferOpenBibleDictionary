This name resulted from a scribal error in the Hebrew text. The original text likely referred to <em>Jair</em>, as reflected in the Berean Standard Bible and many other modern translations. The error happened because the word <em>oregim</em> (which means &quot;weavers&quot;) was accidentally copied twice from later in the verse. Many scholars and translators correct this mistake by following the parallel passage in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5\">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, which names <em>Jair</em> (or <em>Jaor</em> in some manuscripts).</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5358\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jair #3</span>.</p>",
