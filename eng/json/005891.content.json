The inhabitants of Zanoah worked with Hanun to rebuild the Valley Gate as well as about 1,500 feet (457.2 meters) of the city wall during the restoration of Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:13\">Neh 3:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:30\">11:30</a>). The city is probably identifiable with Zanu’a, which is located approximately 10 miles (16.1&nbsp;kilometers) west of Jerusalem.</p><p>2. One of the cities in the Judean highlands south of Hebron that was part of Judah’s inheritance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:56\">Jos 15:56</a>). It was probably inhabited by the descendants of Zanoah, Jekuthiel’s son.</p>",
