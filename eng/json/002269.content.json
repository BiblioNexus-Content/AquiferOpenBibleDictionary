The Assyrians conquered it sometime before Sennacheribâ€™s invasion of Judah (701 BC). This fact is mentioned by Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in a blasphemous letter sent to Hezekiah, king of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:12\">2&nbsp;Kgs 19:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa37:12\">Is 37:12</a>). Later it became one of the places in Assyria where conquered Israelites were deported.</p>",
