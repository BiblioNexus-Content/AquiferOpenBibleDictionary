    "content": "<h1>TYCHICUS</h1><p>One of the believers who accompanied Paul in his trip to collect and deliver the offering for the Jerusalem church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">Acts 20:4</a>). Since he is often mentioned with Trophimus of Ephesus, Tychicus was likely also a native of that city. </p><p>Tychicus delivered Paul’s letter to Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:21\">Ephesians 6:21</a>) as well as Paul’s letters to Philemon and the Colossians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:7\">Colossians 4:7</a>). Most believe that he was also one of the two Christians (with Trophimus) who accompanied Titus in the delivery of 2&nbsp;Corinthians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor8:16-2Cor8:24\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:16–24</a>). </p><p>Paul mentioned Tychicus twice in his later letters, first sending him to Crete to be with Titus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus3:12\">Titus 3:12</a>). Later he mentioned to Timothy that he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:12\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:12</a>). Evidently, Tychicus and Paul were close friends as well as coworkers, since Paul frequently referred to Tychicus as a&nbsp;“beloved brother.”</p>",
