A paralytic experiences temporary or permanent loss of sensation and/or voluntary muscle control in one or more areas of the body. In the case of permanent loss, an affected individual is paralyzed. </p><p>This degenerative condition was considered incurable. A few cases of paralysis are mentioned in the New Testament. All occur in connection with Christ’s healing ministry.</p><p>Paralytics sought Jesus’s healing in Galilee (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:24\">Matthew 4:24</a>). Some paralytics were among the sick at Bethesda in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:3\">John 5:3</a>). Philip cured some paralytics in Samaria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:7\">Acts 8:7</a>). Luke described the paralyzed servant of the centurion as very sick and at the point of death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:2\">Luke 7:2</a>). This man was probably the victim of an often-fatal form of paralysis that begins in the legs and spreads upward through the rest of the body. </p><p>The paralytic at Capernaum was most likely suffering from paraplegia, a paralysis of the lower half of the body (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:2,Matt9:6\">Matthew 9:2, 6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:3-Mark2:10\">Mark 2:3–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:18,Luke5:24\">Luke 5:18, 24</a>). This disease may have come from an injury at birth or from damage to the spinal cord. Aeneas, whom Peter healed at Lydda, may also have suffered from paraplegia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:33\">Acts 9:33</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
