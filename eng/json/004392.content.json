Another name is, <span>“</span>Peniel<span>”</span> (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen32:30\">30</a>). </p><p>Gideon destroyed the tower of Penuel when he was a leader during the time of the judges. He killed the men of the city for refusing to join him in war against the Midianites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:8-Judg8:9,Judg8:17\">Judges 8:8–9, 17</a>). Later, King Jeroboam rebuilt the town (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:25\">1&nbsp;Kings 12:25</a>). It was near Succoth, east of the Jordan River, though its exact location remains uncertain.</p>",
