The king of Shimron-meron was one of 31 kings defeated by Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:20\">Jos 12:20</a>). This king was perhaps one of the northern kings summoned by Jabin, king of Hazor, to combine forces in an attempt to defeat Joshua (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh11:1\">11:1</a>). In all probability, Shimron-meron was one of the 12 cities included in the territory allotted to Zebulun for an inheritance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:15\">19:15</a>).</p>",
