    "content": "<h1>MEREMOTH</h1><p>1. Priest, son of Uriah, grandson of Hakkoz (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33\">Ezr 8:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21\">Neh 3:4, 21</a>). The family of Hakkoz was unable to prove its descent; therefore, they were excluded from the priesthood. Meremoth appears to be an exception. He weighed silver and gold (a priestly function [<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:24-Ezra8:30\">Ezr 8:24–30</a>]), repaired part of the Jerusalem wall (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21\">Neh 3:4, 21</a>), and sealed the covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:5\">10:5</a>).</p><p>2. Priest and Bani’s son, who severed ties with his foreign wife and children at Ezra’s request (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:36\">Ezr 10:36</a>).</p><p>3. Priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:3\">Neh 12:3</a>) and established the house of priests called Meraioth in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:15\">Nehemiah 12:15</a> (though some identify the two references as the same person).</p>",
