    "content": "<h1>GECKO</h1><p>A gecko is a small lizard that belongs to the scientific family <em>Gekkonidae</em>.</p><p>In Jewish food law, the gecko was considered ceremonially unclean. The region of Palestine and Israel has seven different types of gecko species, such as <em>Hemidactylus turcicus</em> and <em>Ptyodactylus hasselquistii</em>. All of these gecko species eat insects. Geckos make a sound that resembles mourning by quickly vibrating their tongues. According to legends, people believed geckos could cause leprosy (a skin disease) by crawling on someone.</p><p>Geckos are also called wall lizards. This name comes from their ability to walk on ceilings using suction discs on their toes. However, they often fall into people&apos;s homes. Since they were considered ceremonially unclean, their presence was very troublesome for Jewish families (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:31-Lev11:38\">Leviticus 11:31â€“38</a>).</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:30\">Leviticus 11:30</a>, the translators of the King James Version incorrectly identified the gecko as a ferret.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5931\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Lizard</span>.</p>",
