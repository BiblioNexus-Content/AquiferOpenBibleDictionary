The ark was a gold-covered wooden box that held important holy items, including the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22\">Exodus 25:10â€“22</a>). </p><p>This room was the most holy space in Israelite worship. Only the high priest could enter it, and only once each year on the Day of Atonement (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34\">Leviticus 16</a>). Before entering, the high priest had to perform special cleansing rituals.</p><p>In the temple, the most holy place was separated from the rest of the building by a thick curtain. This curtain tore from top to bottom when Jesus died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:51\">Matthew 27:51</a>).</p><p>The room was also called the &quot;holy of holies,&quot; which means &quot;the holiest place.&quot; </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7864\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Tabernacle</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Temple</span>.</p>",
