    "content": "<h1>LEGION</h1><p>A legion was a large unit of the Roman army. In New Testament times, the regular size of the legion was 6,000 men. In addition to these men, some 120 cavalry were added.</p><p>Because it was a large body of men, the word “legion” came to represent a generally large number. It is used this way four times in the New Testament. In the&nbsp;story about the demon-possessed man in the country of the Gerasenes, Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?” The man replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark5:9,Mark5:15\">Mark 5:9, 15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:30\">Luke 8:30</a>) <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:45\">Matthew 12:45</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:2\">Luke 8:2</a> speak of&nbsp;a number of demons possessing a single individual.</p><p>Another use of the word is found in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:53\">Matthew 26:53</a>. At the time of Jesus’s arrest, one of those with him drew his sword to defend Jesus. Jesus spoke against such action saying, “<span>Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</span>”  He spoke of the large number of angels that could be called to help him.</p><p>The word “legion” is never used in the New Testament in its military sense. It is used for either the spiritual powers of evil that oppose men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:12\">Ephesians 6:12</a>) or the spiritual powers that can be called to their aid (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:14</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8197\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Warfare</span>.</p>",
