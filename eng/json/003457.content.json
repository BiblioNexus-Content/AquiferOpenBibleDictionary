The Lehabim may be an unidentified people near Egypt. Many scholars hold, probably correctly, that they are identical with the Lubim (Libyans). The Lubim are often seen in the Bible as fighting in alliance with Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan11:43\">Daniel 11:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah3:9\">Nahum 3:9</a>). Sometimes Egypt and this group allied against Israel, as in the time of Rehoboam and Asa ((<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:3\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 12:3</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr16:8\"> 16:8</a>).</p>",
