While not specifically named in the Bible, many scholars believe that lettuce (<em>Lactuca sativa</em>) may have been one of the &quot;bitter herbs&quot; mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:8\">Exodus 12:8</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num9:11\">Numbers 9:11</a>. These bitter herbs were to be eaten with the Passover meal as a reminder of the Israelitesâ€™ suffering in Egypt.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3428\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bitter Herbs</span>.</p>",
