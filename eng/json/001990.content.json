It celebrated the completion of the farming year. During this festival, the Jewish people built temporary shelters called &quot;booths&quot; or &quot;tabernacles&quot; to remember how God saved them from Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:33-Lev23:43\">Leviticus 23:33â€“43</a>). These temporary shelters were similar to the ones the Israelites lived in during their journey through the wilderness after leaving Egypt.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Feasts and Festivals of Israel</span>.</p>",
