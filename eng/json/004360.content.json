    "content": "<h1>PAVILION</h1><p>The English word pavilion is sometimes used in older Bible translations to describe a shelter or covering. It often translates two Hebrew words: <em>sukkah</em> and <em>sokoh</em>. These words refer to simple shelters like a booth, tent, hut, or den.</p><p>The word <em>sukkah</em> is also translated as “shelters” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen33:17\">Genesis 33:17</a>), “tabernacles” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:34\">Leviticus 23:34</a>), and “tents” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:11\">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:11</a>). Other translations of <em>sokoh</em> are “thicket” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps10:9\">Psalm 10:9</a>), “tent” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps76:2\">76:2</a>), and “den” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:38\">Jeremiah 25:38</a>).</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:16\">1&nbsp;Kings 20:16</a>, some English Bibles use the word “pavilions” to describe the tents of King Ben-hadad and his officials. They were drinking in their tents when King Ahab attacked them. Other translations use “booths,” “temporary shelters,” “quarters,” or simply “tents.”</p><p>The book of Psalms also uses the idea of a pavilion in a poetic way. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps27:5\">Psalms 27:5</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps31:20\">31:20</a>, the writer says that the Lord gives special protection. This protection is like a shelter where people can hide from danger. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps18:11\">Psalm 18:11 </a>says, “<span>He made darkness His hiding place, and storm clouds a canopy around Him</span>.” This verse uses picture language to describe how God hides his presence in dark clouds.</p>",
