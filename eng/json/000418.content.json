Some Bible scholars think the Hebrew word <em>tappuach</em> refers to apricots instead of apples.</p><p>Apricot trees have been common in Israel and the surrounding regions since biblical times. These trees grow to about 9.1 meters (30 feet) tall and have reddish bark. Its scientific name is <em>Prunus armeniaca</em>.</p><p>While many Bible translations use the word &quot;apple,&quot; the apricot better matches the descriptions found in the Bible. The Bible mentions this fruit in several places (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov25:11\">Proverbs 25:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:3,Song2:5\">Song of Solomon 2:3, 5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song7:8\">7:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song8:5\">8:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel1:12\">Joel 1:12</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2848\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Apple</span>.</p>",
