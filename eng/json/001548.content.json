    "content": "<h1>DEFORMITY</h1><p>A visible difference in a person&apos;s body shape or structure that is not typical. It can be present from birth or caused by injury or disease.</p><h2>Deformities and the Old Testament Sacrificial System</h2><p>In the Old Testament sacrificial system, both the animal to be sacrificed and the priest who performed the sacrifice could not have defects or blemishes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev1:3\">Leviticus 1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev4:3\">4:3; </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:1-Lev21:24\">21</a>). By being perfect, they are both examples in the Old Testament that point to Christ.</p><p>Eleven of the defects could exclude a man from becoming a priest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:20\">Leviticus 21:17</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:20\">20</a>):</p><ul><li><p>Seven defects in the muscles or skeleton</p></li><li><p>Two defects in the eyes</p></li><li><p>One defect with the skin</p></li><li><p>One defect in the reproductive system </p></li></ul><h2>Nose Deformities</h2><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev21:18\">Leviticus 21:18</a> mentions a condition that affects the nose, described as a &quot;flat nose&quot; in some translations or a &quot;disfigurement&quot; in others. This refers not to a common nose shape but a severe medical condition affecting the nose. Many genetic syndromes cause deformed noses, as do diseases like:</p><ul><li><p>Syphilis</p></li><li><p>Tuberculosis</p></li><li><p>Leprosy</p></li></ul><p>These diseases can destroy the bone and cartilage support of the nose. With the support gone, the skin of the nose sinks inward. This condition causes a “saddle-shaped” deformity in the nose.</p><h2>Withered Arms and Hands</h2><p>Both the Old and the New Testament describe an instance where a man has a “withered“ arm or hand. This is caused when the nerves supplying a limb are damaged, and the muscles decay. An injury, such as a sword striking an arm, can also cause this (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech11:17\">Zechariah 11:17</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus instantly healed a man with a paralyzed hand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:10\">Matthew 12:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark3:1\">Mark 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:6\">Luke 6:6</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4028\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Disease</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
