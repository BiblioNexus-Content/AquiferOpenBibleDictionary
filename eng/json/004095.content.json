    "content": "<h1>NEPHILIM</h1><p>An early group of people mentioned only twice in the Old Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:4\">Genesis 6:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:33\">Numbers 13:33</a>). The Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Septuagint) translated &quot;Nephilim&quot; as &quot;giants.&quot; Other versions, like the King James Version, followed this. Most modern translations call them Nephilim. They link them to the Anakim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:33\">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:21\">Deuteronomy 2:21</a>) and the Rephaim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut2:20\">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>). These groups were known for their large size, which is why they were often called &quot;giants.&quot;</p><p>The origin of the Nephilim is unclear. Some say the Hebrew verb <em>naphal</em>, meaning &quot;to fall,&quot; implies the Nephilim were &quot;fallen ones.&quot; These were fallen angels who later had children with human women. But Jesus taught that angels do not have physical relationships (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:34-Luke20:35\">Luke 20:34</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:34-Luke20:35\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:34-Luke20:35\">35</a>). This idea assumes that <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen6:4\">Genesis 6:1–4</a> reflects Greek myths, where such unions happened. However, the passage in Genesis is about human history, not mythology.</p><p>The Nephilim were probably not the &quot;sons of God&quot; in the Bible. They seem different from the &quot;daughters of men.&quot; To understand them, think of an ancient people group, like the Anakim and Rephaim, whose origins are unknown.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4612\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Giants</span>.</p>",
