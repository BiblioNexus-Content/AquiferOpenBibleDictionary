Before Herod rebuilt it, the city was known as Aphek. When Paul was a Roman Prisoner, he traveled through Antipatris on his way from Jerusalem to Caesarea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:31\">Acts 23:31</a>). Antipatris was a Roman military relay station. It also marked the border between Judea and Samaria.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2823\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Aphek</span>.</p>",
