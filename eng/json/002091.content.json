Demetrius the silversmith started the riot (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:29\">Acts 19:29</a>).</p></li><li><p>A man from Derbe in Lycaonia (a region in what is now Turkey). He traveled with the apostle Paul from Ephesus to Macedonia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">Acts 20:4</a>). Some have identified him with #1 above.</p></li><li><p>An important Christian in Corinth. He hosted Paul and the whole church there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:23\">Romans 16:23</a>). Paul wrote the letter of Romans at Corinth. So, the Gaius mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:14\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:14</a> is probably the same person. If so, Paul baptized him.</p></li><li><p> A man to whom the apostle John addressed his third letter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/3John1:1\">3&nbsp;John 1:1</a>).</p></li></ol>",
