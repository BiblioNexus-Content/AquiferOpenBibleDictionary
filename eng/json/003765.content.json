It is probably not a&nbsp;settlement; Jarkon seems to be the name of the river (el-’Awjah) flowing across the coastal plain from the springs at Aphek to the coast four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Joppa. It was a formidable obstacle to north–south travel, but the numerous ancient sites along its banks testify to its importance as an entryway from the sea to the interior of the country.</p>",
