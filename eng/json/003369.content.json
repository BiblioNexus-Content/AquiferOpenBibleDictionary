    "content": "<h1>KISS, KISS OF PEACE</h1><p>A common way to show love and fellowship in biblical times. </p><p>Kissing appears in the Bible in many different contexts:</p><ul><li><p>Kisses were shared among relatives and friends as a sign of affection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:11\">Genesis 29:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen33:4\">33:4</a>).</p></li><li><p>Sometimes kisses had a sensual meaning (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov7:6-Prov7:13\">Proverbs 7:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:2\">Song of Solomon 1:2</a>).</p></li><li><p>Kissing was also a way to show respect or worship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job31:27\">Job 31:27</a>), though it could be seen as wrong in certain situations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:18\">1&nbsp;Kings 19:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos13:2\">Hosea 13:2</a>).</p></li><li><p>A kiss could be used to betray someone, as seen in the story of Jesus&apos; betrayal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:48-Matt26:49\">Matthew 26:48–49</a>).</p></li></ul><p>In the New Testament, there are five mentions of a “holy kiss,” also known as the “kiss of peace:” </p><ol><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:16\">Romans 16:16</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:20\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:20</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor13:12\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:12</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:26\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:26</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:14\">1&nbsp;Peter 5:14</a></p></li></ol><p>This kiss was a symbol of Christian love and unity. Although the Bible doesn’t give detailed instructions, it was a gesture of friendship and commitment among early Christians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:25-1Thess5:27\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:25–27</a>).</p><p>By the late second century, this practice became a part of church liturgy. Justin Martyr described it as a kiss exchanged among the congregation after prayer. Over time, it was moved to before Holy Communion and eventually replaced by a simple bow in many churches. Today, some churches still have different forms of this practice.</p>",
