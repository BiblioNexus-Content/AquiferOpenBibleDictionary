The leaves of these trees are used as food for silkworms.</p><p>The mulberry tree mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:6\">Luke 17:6</a> is likely the black mulberry (<em>Morus nigra</em>). It is a low-growing tree with a thick crown and stiff branches. It usually grows between 7.3 to 10.7 meters (24 to 35 feet) tall, though rarely more than 9.1 meters (30 feet).</p><p>The black mulberry originally came from northern Persia (modern Iran). Today, people grow this tree throughout the Middle East for its fruit.</p><p>The Chinese or Indian mulberry species (<em>Morus alba</em>) was widely grown in Syria and Israel and the surrounding areas until recent times, but it is not native to those areas.</p>",
