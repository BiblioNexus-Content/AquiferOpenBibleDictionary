    "content": "<h1>KABZEEL</h1><p>A city located in the far southern part of the territory of Judah next to Edom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:21\">Joshua 15:21). </a>It was also called Jekabzeel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:25\">Nehemiah 11:25</a>). Benaiah, one of David&apos;s brave warriors, came from Kabzeel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:22\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:22</a>). The reference in Nehemiah indicates that the tribe of Judah returned to this area after the exile to Babylon. The exact location of Kabzeel is not known today, but some suggest it might have been at a place called Khirbet Hora.</p>",
