    "content": "<h1>NEW</h1><p>Something which has just been created or come into existence. The new often replaces something which already existed, turning the old into new.</p><p>That the second part of the Bible is called the <em>New</em> Testament shows how important the idea of &quot;new&quot; is to biblical revelation. Many important theological ideas include the concept of new: </p><ul><li><p>new creation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17</a>),</p></li><li><p>new birth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:3\">John 3:3</a>),</p></li><li><p>new man (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:15\">Ephesians 2:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:10\">Colossians 3:10</a>),</p></li><li><p>new commandment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>),</p></li><li><p>new covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31\">Jeremiah 31:31</a>),</p></li><li><p>new life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:4\">Romans 6:4</a>), and various others.</p></li></ul><h2>The Expectation of the New</h2><p>The totality of the expectation of the <em>new</em> is best expressed in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and the Psalms. The reference in the Psalter to the &quot;new song&quot; to be given to the people to sing is a central metaphor (For example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:3\">Psalms 33:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps40:3\">40:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps149:1\">149:1</a>; compare also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa42:10\">Isaiah 42:10</a>). Jeremiah speaks of the day when God will make a new covenant (special agreement) with the house of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34\">Jeremiah 31:31–34</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek34:25-Ezek34:31\">Ezekiel 34:25–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:26-Ezek37:28\">37:26–28</a>). In contrast with the old, this new covenant will be internal, written upon the heart. Ezekiel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek36:22-Ezek36:32\">Ezekiel 36:22–32</a>) also tells of the day when God will cleanse his people and will give a heart of flesh in place of the heart of stone. </p><p>This act of God&apos;s holiness will introduce the age of the Spirit. It will bring about a new existence, characterized by security and freedom, where the laws of God are followed. The supreme feature of this new time is the new spirit within people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:19\">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). Joel speaks also of that day when the Spirit of God will be poured out on all flesh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Joel2:28\">Joel 2:28</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:17\">Isaiah 65:17</a> states the promise of &quot;new heavens and a new earth.&quot; Isaiah&apos;s words often reflect national circumstances and hopes (for example, after the exile). However, this promise took on new significance beyond the hope of the nation Israel.</p><h2>The Coming of the New</h2><p>The presence of the kingdom in the world through Jesus announces that the promised new age has broken into time in powerful ways. Jesus’s ministry is one of fulfillment. What the prophets promised has begun to take place. John the Baptist had prepared the way for the one who would give the promised Spirit. The giving of this Spirit is the giving of new life. Through faith in Christ, one is born anew (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:3-John3:7\">John 3:3–7</a>). But Jesus had to die in order for this new life to be given. The cup of wine Jesus shared with his disciples at the Last Supper symbolized the blood of the new covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:24\">Mark 14:24</a>).</p><p>The early church expressed this significance in using many metaphors: </p><ul><li><p>This &quot;newness of life&quot; is demonstrated through baptism (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:4\">Romans 6:4</a>). </p></li><li><p>The eucharistic cup is the new covenant through blood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:25</a>). </p></li><li><p>An extended discourse on the old and new covenants shows that by the shedding of his blood Christ has become mediator of a new covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:15\">Hebrews 9:15</a>). </p></li><li><p>By his blood, Jesus has opened up a new and living way into the Holy Place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:19-Heb10:20\">10:19–20</a>). </p></li><li><p>Paul restates the promise of Ezekiel for a heart of flesh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor3:3\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3</a>). He then gives an account of the ministry of the new covenant in contrast to the old. </p></li><li><p>The church represents the appearance of the new age in the domain of the old.</p></li><li><p>The one who comes to Christ by faith is declared a new person, a new creation, for whom the old has passed away (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:15\">Galatians 6:15</a>). </p></li><li><p>Jewish-gentile hostility disappears in the resulting &quot;new humanity&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:15\">Ephesians 2:15</a>). </p></li><li><p>All other social distinctions (such as male-female, slave-free) pass away in the new humanity created in Christ Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:10-Col3:11\">Colossians 3:10–11</a>).</p></li></ul><p>The newness of a person in Christ is the foundation for New Testament ethics (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:24\">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12\">Colossians 3:12</a>). The new commandment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:34\">John 13:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:8\">1&nbsp;John 2:8</a>) is not really new (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:7\">1&nbsp;John 2:7</a>), but now has new possibility and deeper meaning by the power and example of Jesus. Though this new life is a gift of God, the <em>process</em> of being made new continues. Transformation by the renewing of the mind (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:2\">Romans 12:2</a>) realizes the will of God. Paul declares the inner self is being renewed day by day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:16\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:16</a>).</p><h2>The Realization of the New</h2><p>As real as the new life of the believer is, Scripture shows a tension between the new age that is not yet realized. The time when all things are made new is a future promise (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:5\">Revelation 21:5</a>). With the end of the old, there is a new heaven and new earth. The new Jerusalem &quot;coming down out of heaven&quot; as the dwelling place of God (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:2\">2</a>). The people of God receive a new name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:12\">3:12</a>) as the old things disappear. </p><p>The people who are the redeemed of the Lord are given a new song to sing. The song is about the Lamb slain from the beginning of creation:</p><p><span>The first line of the song is &quot;Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!&quot;</span> The chorus returns, <span>&quot;To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever!&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev5:12-Rev5:13\">Revelation 5:12–13</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3787\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Commandment, The New</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3841\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Covenant, The New</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5500\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jerusalem, New</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6096\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Man, Old and New</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6548\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">New Creation, New Creature</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6550\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">New Heavens and New Earth</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7147\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Regeneration</span>.</p>",
