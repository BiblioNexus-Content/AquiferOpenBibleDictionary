Jesus said that people must be &quot;born again&quot; to see the kingdom of God. This new birth does not come from human parents. It comes from God’s Spirit.</p><p>New birth is also called <em>regeneration</em> (a word that means being made new). It happens when God gives someone a new heart and a new spirit.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7147\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Regeneration</span>.</p>",
