When they reached the threshing floor of Nacon, a man named Uzzah reached out and touched the ark to steady it, and God struck him dead (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6\">2&nbsp;Samuel 6:6</a>). </p><p>Because of this incident, David renamed this place &quot;Perez-uzzah,&quot; which means &quot;the breaking forth upon Uzzah&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:8\">2 Samuel 6:8</a>). In another account of this same event, this place is called &quot;Kidon&quot; instead of &quot;Nacon&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr13:9\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 13:9</a>).</p>",
