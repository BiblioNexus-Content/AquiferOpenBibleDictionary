Ayyah is another name for Gaza, but different from the Philistine Gaza. Some scholars think that the Aija listed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:31\">Nehemiah 11:31</a> refers to Ayyah or Ai, possibly a neighboring town. Many identify Aiath from <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa10:28\">Isaiah 10:28</a> with Ayyah. It is the modern Khirbet Haiyan.</p>",
