    "content": "<h1>LEAH</h1><p>Leah was the daughter of Laban and the older sister of Rachel. </p><p>She became the wife of Jacob, who had deceived his father Isaac into giving him the blessing meant for Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:5-Gen27:40\">Genesis 27:5–40</a>). To escape Esau&apos;s anger and find a wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:46-Gen28:2\">Genesis 27:46–28:2</a>), Jacob went to his uncle Laban in Mesopotamia (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:43\">Genesis 27:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen28:2\">28:2</a>). He fell in love with Rachel, Laban&apos;s younger daughter, and agreed to work for Laban for seven years to marry her (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:17-Gen29:18\">Genesis 29:17–18</a>).</p><p>When the wedding came, Laban tricked Jacob by giving him Leah, the older daughter, instead of Rachel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:21-Gen29:25\">Genesis 29:21–25</a>). Laban justified this by saying that the older daughter must be married first (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:26\">Genesis 29:26</a>). Leah was described as having &quot;weak-eyed,&quot; while Rachel was &quot;<span>shapely and beautiful</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:17\">Genesis 29:17</a>).</p><p>Jacob worked for another seven years to marry Rachel, whom he loved deeply (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:20\">Genesis 29:20</a>). Leah, who was not favored as Rachel was, had six sons and a daughter before Rachel had any children (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:31-Gen30:22\">Genesis 29:31–30:22</a>): </p><ol><li><p>Reuben</p></li><li><p>Simeon</p></li><li><p>Levi</p></li><li><p>Judah</p></li><li><p>Issachar</p></li><li><p>Zebulun</p></li><li><p>Dinah</p></li></ol><p>Rachel&apos;s inability to have children was a significant sorrow for her, and she even traded mandrakes, a plant believed to ensure conception, with Leah to try to conceive (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:14-Gen30:17\">Genesis 30:14–17</a>).</p><p>Leah&apos;s sons became important in Israel&apos;s history. Her son Levi became the ancestor of the priests, and her son Judah was the ancestor of the royal line from which Jesus Christ descended (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:15\">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:2-Gen12:3\">12:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:16\">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:1\">Matthew 1:1</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5331\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Jacob #1</span>.</p>",
