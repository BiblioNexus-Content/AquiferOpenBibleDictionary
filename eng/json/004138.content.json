    "content": "<h1>NICOLAS, NICOLAUS</h1><p>Nicolas was one of the seven men named in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:5\">Acts 6:5 </a>who was chosen to serve in the early Jerusalem church. His job, as specified in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:4\">Acts 6:1â€“4</a>, was to make sure food was distributed fairly and equally among all church members. People traditionally call these seven men &quot;deacons&quot; (which means &quot;servers&quot;) because <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:1\">Acts 6:1</a> uses terms like &quot;daily distribution&quot; or &quot;service&quot; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:2\">6:2</a> uses phrases like &quot;to wait on tables&quot; or &quot;to serve.&quot;</p><p>Nicolas is the last name in the list. The Bible identifies him as a proselyte, which means he was a gentile (non-Jewish person) who had converted to Judaism before becoming a Christian. He had a Greek name, and his home city was Antioch. The New Testament does not give us any more information about him.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3944\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Deacon, Deaconess</span>.</p>",
