Jesus and his disciples stayed there for a short time after the feeding of the 4,000 (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:10\">Mark 8:10</a>). The Pharisees came to him seeking a sign from heaven to test Jesus. After his answer that no sign would be given to this generation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:12\">Mark 8:12</a>), he departed from there.</p><p>The word “Dalmanutha” is present in the best and oldest copies of the Bible. Some other sources use the names Magadan or Magdala. Matthew&apos;s version of this story in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt15:39\">Matthew 15:39</a> uses the name Magadan. Because of this, the exact name and location have been difficult to identify. Probably the different names are meant to identify the same location or at least two places in the same area.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6015\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Magadan</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6017\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Magdala</span>.</p>",
