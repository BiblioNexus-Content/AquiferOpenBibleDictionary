    "content": "<h1>AMPHIPOLIS</h1><p>A city in ancient Greece. It was once the home of the Thracian Edoni tribe. Amphipolis occupied a strategic location in a fertile area on the eastern bank of&nbsp;the Strymon River. Its name means “around city.” This may refer to the river which surrounds the city on three sides. It is located about 48.2&nbsp;kilometers or 30 miles from Philippi. It eventually became an important station on the Roman road called the Via Egnatia. On his second missionary journey, Paul passed&nbsp;through this commercial center on his way to Thessalonica (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:1\">Acts 17:1</a>).</p>",
