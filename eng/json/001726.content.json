    "content": "<h1>ELEALEH</h1><p>Elealeh was a town located across the Jordan River to the northeast of Heshbon. The tribes of Reuben and Gad conquered this town (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:3,Num32:37\">Numbers 32:3, 37</a>). Later, the Moabites took control of Elealeh again. The prophets mentioned Elealeh together with Heshbon when they spoke against Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:4\">Isaiah 15:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa16:9\">16:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:34\">Jeremiah 48:34</a>).</p><p>Eusebius, a church historian who lived in the fourth century AD, described Elealeh as a large village. Scholars identify Elealeh with the modern village of el-&apos;Al. This village is 910.1 meters ( 2,986 feet) above sea level in an area known for growing many grapes. Archaeologists have found the remains of walls dating back to the time before the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) lived.</p>",
