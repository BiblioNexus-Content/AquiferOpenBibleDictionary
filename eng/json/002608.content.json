Its location is in doubt, but most likely it was eight miles (12.8 kilometers) north of Gadara and four miles (6.4 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee near the road to Damascus. Its position was of strategic military importance in the defense of Jerusalem, while its location was also ideal for trading, from which it exported not only its merchandise but also Greek culture.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3958\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Decapolis</span>.</p>",
