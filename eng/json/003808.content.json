There, Israel contended with Moses for water at the start of the wilderness wanderings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:7\">Exodus 17:7</a>). This is the place probably referred to in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:8\">Deuteronomy 33:8</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps95:8\">Psalm 95:8</a> and is also called Massah.</p></li><li><p>Another place where Israel fought with Moses for water. It is near Kadesh-barnea in the wilderness of Zin. God again provided water from a rock (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num20:13,Num20:24\">Numbers 20:13, 24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num27:14\">27:14</a>); also called Meribath-kadesh in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:51\">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>. This event happened toward the end of the Israelites&apos; time in the desert. The waters of Meribah were called &quot;waters of conflict&quot; because God became angry with Moses and Aaron there. They did not follow God&apos;s exact instructions to speak to the rock. Instead, Moses—who was frustrated by the people&apos;s stubbornness—struck the rock twice with his staff. The psalm writer tells us that God tested Israel at this place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps81:7\">Psalm 81:7</a>), and Israel’s rebellion led Moses to sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps106:32\">Psalm 106:32</a>). Meribah-kadesh is mentioned as being on Israel’s southern border (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek47:19\">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek48:28\">48:28</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6139\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Massah and Meribah</span>.</p></li></ol>",
