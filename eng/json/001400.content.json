    "content": "<h1>CORBAN</h1><p>Corban is a word that comes from Hebrew (<em>korban</em>). In the Bible, it appears only in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:11\">Mark 7:11.</a> In this verse, Mark explains that corban means something that is given to God as an offering.</p><p>Making something corban was a very serious choice. The Mishnah (a collection of Jewish oral laws and traditions) explains that once something was declared corban, this decision was rarely changed (Mishnah, Nedarim 5). Breaking a corban vow was considered very serious because people believed God would punish them.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:1-Mark7:37\">Mark 7</a>, Jesus rejects the teaching of the scribes. The scribes taught that by the law a&nbsp;son could deny his parents from gaining any benefit from his property. To do this the son would state his property was “corban to them.” This practice goes against God&apos;s command to honor your parents (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:12\">Exodus 20:12</a>). The Jewish teachers&apos; rules about corban were conflicting with God&apos;s law given through Moses.</p><p>Even if a son later felt sorry and wanted to help his parents, the Jewish religious leaders would not allow him to take back his corban declaration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark7:12\">Mark 7:12</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num30:1-Num30:2\">Numbers 30:1–2</a>).</p>",
