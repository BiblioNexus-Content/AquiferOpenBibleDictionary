Derbe was the last city visited by Paul during his first missionary journey (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:20\">20</a>). It was also the first city Paul visited while on his second journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:1\">16:1</a>). And it is likely one city he revisited on his third journey (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:23\">18:23</a>). </p><p>Gaius was from Derbe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:4\">20:4</a>).
