    "content": "<h1>ASIARCH</h1><p>The title of an important official in the Roman province of Asia. We do not know exactly what their job was. Several Asiarchs were worried about Paul&apos;s safety during a silversmith&apos;s riot in Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:31\">Acts 19:31</a>).</p><p>We do not know much else about Asiarchs. We do not know: what skills they needed for the job, how long they worked as Asiarchs, or what their exact duties were.</p><p>It is not clear why there were many Asiarchs in Ephesus during the riot or why they cared about Paul&apos;s safety. They might have been leaders of the &quot;Commune of Asia.&quot; If so, their job was to support and protect the imperial cult (the worship of Rome and the emperor).</p><p>The Asiarchs mentioned in Acts did not seem to dislike Christianity. Christianity was challenging the popular pagan worship of Artemis (a Greek goddess). </p><p>The long story in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:1-Acts19:41\">Acts 19</a> shows one of Luke&apos;s main ideas: Christianity wasn&apos;t trying to cause trouble, and Paul was not a political threat. If he had been, the Asiarchs probably would not have helped him.</p>",
