Against Paul&apos;s advice, the ship left a harbor near Lasea. They sailed close to the coast of Crete as a gentle breeze pushed them along. Probably when they were less than 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) from shore, a sudden violent storm threatened their small boat. </p><p>Luke, who wrote Acts, calls this storm a typhoon (in the King James Version it is called a &quot;tempestuous wind&quot;). The name of this wind was Euroclydon, which means &quot;the southwest wind that stirs up waves.&quot;</p>",
