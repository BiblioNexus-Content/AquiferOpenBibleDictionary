In the archives at Ecbatana, a summer resort for Persian kings, King Darius (521–486 BC) found an edict of Cyrus (559–530 BC) that entitled the Jews to begin reconstruction of the Jerusalem temple following the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra6:2\">Ezr 6:2</a>). On the basis of that edict, Darius gave his support to renewed reconstruction efforts, which had been halted for 16 years due to local opposition (cf. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1\">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech1:1\">Zec 1:1</a>).</p>",
