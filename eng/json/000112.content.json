    "content": "<h1>ADDER</h1><p>One of 20 poisonous snakes in Israel and nearby countries. It is also called a cockatrice and a viper. True vipers (genus <em>Cerastes, Echis colorata</em>, and <em>Vipera palestina</em>) also exist there. They are poisonous snakes. These snakes have special hollow teeth called fangs that move into position when they bite. The horned viper <em>(Cerastes hasselquistii)</em> can attack horses. It is 30 to 46 centimeters (12 to 18 inches) long. It often hides in the sand, showing only its eyes and the horn-like bumps on its head.</p><p>Both Jesus and John the Baptist referred to the viper several times (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:7\">Matthew 3:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:34\">12:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:33\">23:33</a>). The reference in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:3\">Acts 28:3</a> likely refers to a small, aggressive viper (<em>Vipera aspis</em>) that strikes quickly. It is found in southern Europe and hisses each time it inhales and exhales. The poison of vipers attacks lung function and destroys red blood cells.</p><p><em>See </em><span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7717\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Snake</span>.</p>",
