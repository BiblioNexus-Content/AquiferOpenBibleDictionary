    "content": "<h1>TESTAMENT</h1><p>Testament is an English word that comes from a Greek word. In the Bible, it describes the different ways God made agreements (called &quot;covenant&quot;) with people. The first covenant is called the &quot;Old Testament,&quot; which was before Jesus came. The second covenant is called the &quot;New Testament,&quot; which began with Jesus.</p><p>The Greek word for testament originally meant something like a person&apos;s last will. A last will is a legal document that says what should happen to their property after they die. This meaning helps us understand three important things about God&apos;s testament:</p><ol><li><p>A testament is different from a regular agreement. In a regular agreement, two or more people work out terms together. But a testament comes from just one person (called the &quot;testator&quot;) who decides everything.</p></li><li><p>A testament only starts working after the person who made it has died.</p></li><li><p>Once a testament is made, it cannot be changed.</p></li></ol><p>When the Old Testament was translated into Greek, the translators had two options to translate the Hebrew word for &quot;covenant.&quot; They could have used a word that meant an agreement where both sides had equal power to make decisions. But they chose not to use this word. Instead, they used a different word that showed that God was the one who decided the terms of the covenant. This better matched how God made covenants with the patriarchs and the people of Israel.</p><p>The writers of the New Testament found even more meaning in this word choice. They understood that just as a person&apos;s will only takes effect after they die, the new covenant God made with his people came into effect through Jesus&apos;s death (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:15-Heb9:22\">Hebrews 9:15</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:15-Heb9:22\">â€“</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:15-Heb9:22\">22</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:20\">Luke 22:20</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3842\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Covenant</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3841\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Covenant, The New</span>.</p>",
