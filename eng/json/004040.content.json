    "content": "<h1>NAIOTH</h1><p>Naioth was a place where David found safety when King Saul was trying to kill him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:18-1Sam20:1\">1&nbsp;Samuel 19:18–20:1</a>).The prophet Samuel gave David a place to stay there. Samuel also led a group of prophets in Naioth. These prophets lived and worked together in the town of Ramah, where Samuel was from (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:19\">1 Samuel 1:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:23\">23</a>).</p><p>The name “Naioth” is hard to explain. It only appears in this story, and the Hebrew word is not clear. Some people think it comes from a Hebrew word that means “dwelling place” (a place where people live). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:25\">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:25</a>, a similar word is used for the place where God lives. This has led some to think that Naioth might have been a kind of sanctuary (a special place for worship or prayer) in Ramah (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:5\">1&nbsp;Samuel 10:5</a>). </p><p>Others think Naioth was a place where prophets lived and learned together, like a school or a small community. Samuel was the leader of this group.</p>",
