    "content": "<h1>HOSPITALITY</h1><p>A biblical concept often used with the terms “guest,” “stranger,” and “sojourner.” It is useful to limit the meaning of “hospitality” to kindness done to those outside one’s normal group of friends. This is implied in the literal meaning of the Greek word meaning “love of strangers.” Although the concept is thoroughly endorsed in the Bible, it is clearly found in nonbiblical cultures as well. It is especially found among the nomadic peoples (who travel from place to place). Definite obligations to provide food, shelter, and protection are recognized in these cultures.</p><p>The normal exercise of hospitality in the Old Testament can be seen in these examples:</p><ul><li><p> Abraham and the three visitors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:2-Gen18:8,Gen18:16\">Genesis 18:2–8, 16</a>)</p></li><li><p>Laban’s reception of Abraham’s servant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:15-Gen24:61\">Genesis 24:15–61</a>)</p></li><li><p>Manoah’s treatment of the angel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg13:15\">Judges 13:15</a>)</p></li></ul><p>But there are also cases in which the host felt compelled to take extreme steps to protect his guest, even to the harm of his own family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:1-Gen19:8\">Genesis 19:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg19:14-Judg19:24\">Judges 19:14–24</a>). The hospitality of the Shunammite family is also notable, although Elisha was no stranger to them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:10\">2&nbsp;Kings 4:10</a>).</p><p>According to the New Testament, Jesus relied on the general practice of hospitality in sending out the disciples (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:7\">Luke 10:7</a>), as well as in his own travels. As the gospel was spread by traveling missionaries, Christians were commended for entertaining them in their homes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:2\">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:9\">1&nbsp;Peter 4:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/3John1:5-3John1:8\">3&nbsp;John 1:5–8</a>). Church leaders must not exempt themselves from this ministry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim3:2\">1&nbsp;Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus1:8\">Titus 1:8</a>). To do so is cause for judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:43-Matt25:46\">Matthew 25:43–46</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4457\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Foreigner</span>.</p>",
