    "content": "<h1>BETH-HORON</h1><p>A Canaanite place name, perhaps meaning “the house of Hauron,” the god of the underworld. Beth-horon was two towns located 16.1 and 19.3 kilometers (10 and 12 miles) northwest of Jerusalem. These towns were on the border between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh16:3,Josh16:5\">Joshua 16:3, 5</a>). The two settlements were important because they controlled the Aijalon Valley, a key ancient route that connected the Mediterranean coast to the interior hill country. The upper town guarded a strategic mountain pass. The town of Beth-Horon in Ephraim, along with its surrounding fields, was given to the Levite family of Kohath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:22\">Joshua 21:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:68\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:68</a>).</p><p>Many armies passed through the Aijalon Valley near Beth-Horon. After Joshua defeated the Amorites at Gibeon, they fled past Beth-Horon on “the day the sun stood still” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14\">Joshua 10:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14\">14</a>). A group of Philistines also passed through here to fight King Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam13:18\">1&nbsp;Samuel 13:18</a>). The Egyptian army under King Shishak also passed by Beth-Horon, as recorded in his Karnak inscription. Syrian forces led by Seron (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc3:13-1Macc3:24\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 3:13–24</a>) and Nicanor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc7:39-1Macc7:43\">7:39–43</a>) were defeated by Judas Maccabeus at Beth-Horon. Later, Roman troops led by Cestius were nearly destroyed by Jewish forces there, according to the Jewish historian Josephus.</p><p>Beth-Horon was likely destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. Sheerah, the daughter of Beriah and granddaughter of Ephraim, is credited with building both the lower and upper towns of Beth-Horon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:24\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:24</a>). King Solomon later strengthened both towns after nearby raids by an Egyptian pharaoh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17\">1&nbsp;Kings 9:15</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17\">17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr8:5\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:5</a>). During the period between the two Testaments, the Syrian general Bacchides strengthened the defences of Beth-Horon after battling Jonathan Maccabeus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc9:50\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 9:50</a>).</p>",
