    "content": "<h1>HALAKAH</h1><p>The term for Jewish law. Halakah literally means &quot;walking.&quot; It provides the authoritative Jewish way of life as written in the Mishnah. It shows Jewish people how they should live their lives and what they must do (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:20\">Exodus 18:20</a>).</p><p>Halakah is based on two main sources. First, it comes from the biblical laws found in the written Law (the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible) and the oral law. According to Jewish tradition, the oral law was given to Moses on Mount Sinai but not written down. It was passed down through many generations and later recorded in the Talmud (a collection of Jewish writings that explain the law).</p><p>For example, the Pentateuch says not to work on the Sabbath. But it does not explain what &quot;work&quot; means. The written Law does not help with this question. However, in the Talmud we find Halakah, which interprets the written Law. The Talmud explains what &quot;work&quot; means on the Sabbath.</p><p>Second, Halakah includes all the teachings and decisions from important Jewish scholars throughout history. All these sources together (the written and oral law plus the history of Jewish legal scholarship) create what we call Halakah. These sources help make religious and legal decisions in orthodox Jewish communities.</p><p>Halakah is meant to cover every part of life. It gives guidance about eating habits, sexual life, business ethics, social activities, entertainment, and much more. Because it covers so many aspects of daily life, people often call it &quot;the Jewish way.&quot; It serves as the Jewish legal and practical guide to living.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4753\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Haggadah</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7892\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Talmud</span>.</p>",
