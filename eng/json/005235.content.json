    "content": "<h1>SILVERSMITH</h1><p>A silversmith is a person who works with silver to make different objects. These skilled workers take raw silver ore, clean it to remove impurities, and then shape it into many useful items.</p><p>In the Bible, silversmiths produced musical instruments like trumpets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:2\">Numbers 10:2</a>). They also made bases that supported the frame of the tabernacle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod26:19-Exod26:25\">Exodus 26:19–25</a>). They formed objects to use in the tabernacle and temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:13-Num7:85\">Numbers 7:13–85</a>). </p><p>Silversmiths fashioned ornaments for private use as well. Some also made religious statues for false worship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:23\">Exodus 20:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:4\">Judges 17:4</a>). Demetrius was a silversmith at Ephesus. He made silver shrines for the goddess Artemis (also called Diana) (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:24\">Acts 19:24</a>). This profession was well known in New Testament times (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:20\">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev9:20\">Revelation 9:20</a>).</p>",
