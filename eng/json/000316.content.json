Amram married Jochebed and had three famous children: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:16-Exod6:20\">Exodus 6:16–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num26:58-Num26:59\">Numbers 26:58–59</a>). During the Israelites’ wilderness journey, the Amramites had a special responsibility. They were in charge of caring for the ark of the covenant and the table, lampstand, altars, and other furnishings used in the tabernacle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num3:27,Num3:31\">Numbers 3:27, 31</a>). Later, the Amramites were one of the groups in charge of offerings placed in the temple treasury (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:23-1Chr26:24\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:23–24</a>).</p></li><li><p>A priest from Bani’s family. He obeyed Ezra’s strong advice to divorce his non-Jewish wife after the exile to Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:34\">Ezra 10:34</a>).</p></li><li><p>The King James Version uses this as a form of Hamran to identify Dishon’s son, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:41\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:41</a>. Hamran itself is an alternate form of Hemdan (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:26\">Genesis 36:26</a>). <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4964\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hemdan</span>.</p></li></ol>",
