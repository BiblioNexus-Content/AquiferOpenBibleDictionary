    "content": "<h1>SHEALTIEL</h1><p>The son of King Jeconiah (also called Jehoiachin) of Judah and the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel led the Jews back to Palestine and there ruled as governor of Judah during the postexilic period (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2\">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:2\">5:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:1\">Nehemiah 12:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1,Hag1:12-Hag1:14\">Haggai 1:1, 12</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1,Hag1:12-Hag1:14\">14</a>). In the family lists of Jesus Christ, Shealtiel is mentioned as the son of Jeconiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:12\">Matthew 1:12</a>) and as the son of Neri (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:27\">Luke 3:27</a>). In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17-1Chr3:19\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:17</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17-1Chr3:19\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17-1Chr3:19\">19</a>, Shealtiel appears to be the grandfather or perhaps the uncle of Zerubbabel. One likely solution is that Shealtiel was Neri&apos;s son and Jeconiah&apos;s heir. At Shealtiel&apos;s death, Zerubbabel was next in line for the throne.</p>",
