    "content": "<h1>PRISCILLA AND AQUILA</h1><h2>Who Were Priscilla and Aquila?</h2><p>A Christian couple who were friends and possible converts of the apostle Paul. Luke mentions them during the ministry of Paul at Corinth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:1-Acts18:3\">Acts 18:1–3</a>). They are always listed together in the New Testament. The name of Priscilla comes before Aquila in four out of six references (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:18,Acts18:26\">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:26\">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:3\">Romans 16:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:19</a>). This may be due to her personal character or her leadership role in the church.</p><p>Aquila was a Jew and a native of Pontus in Asia Minor. The AD 49 edict of the emperor Claudius expelled him from Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:2\">Acts 18:2</a>). The historian Suetonius refers to this edict. “He banished from Rome all the Jews, who were continually making disturbances at the instigation of one Chrestus.” </p><h2>Friends and Coworkers of Paul</h2><p>From Rome, Aquila and Priscilla went to Corinth. There Paul met them. This was on his second missionary journey. They lived together and worked as tentmakers. Their close association with Paul had benefits. Later, they even instructed the learned Jewish teacher Apollos. Then he &quot;<span>powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ&quot;</span> (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:24-Acts18:28\">24–28</a>).</p><p>Both Priscilla and Aquila were loyal friends and trusted coworkers of Paul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:3-Rom16:4\">Romans 16:3–4</a>). When he left Corinth, they accompanied him. Then they remained at Ephesus after he returned to Syria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:18-Acts18:19\">Acts 18:18–19</a>). When Paul wrote the First Letter to Corinth, they were still at Ephesus. Their home became a place for Christians to gather (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:19\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:19</a>). Then decree of Claudius ended. So Priscilla and Aquila went back to Rome. This was when Paul wrote to the Roman Christians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:3\">Romans 16:3</a>). When the Second Letter to Timothy was written, Priscilla and Aquila were back in Ephesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19\">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:19</a>).</p>",
