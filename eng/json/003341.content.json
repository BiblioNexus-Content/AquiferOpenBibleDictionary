    "content": "<h1>KIR</h1><p>1. Mesopotamian city from which the Syrians migrated to Damascus and back to which they were later exiled by the Assyrians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos1:5\">Am 1:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos9:7\">9:7</a>). Escape from Kir to Aram paralleled the exodus of the Israelites. It must have been a terribly bitter experience to have been deported (by Tiglath-pileser) back to Kir (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9\">2&nbsp;Kgs 16:9</a>). Whether the city actually existed or not is debatable. It could have become a metaphor for enslavement and exile.</p><p>2. Fortress usually identified with the ancient capital of Moab. Soldiers from Kir were associated with those from Elam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa22:6\">Is 22:6</a>). Likewise, Kir was paralleled with Ar in Isaiahâ€™s lament over Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa15:1\">15:1</a>). Kir of Moab, therefore, is probably the same as Kir-hareseth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:25\">2&nbsp;Kgs 3:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa16:7\">Is 16:7</a>), located at Kerak, 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) east of the southern end of the Dead Sea.</p>",
