He had three sons: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen10:3\">Gn 10:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:6\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:6</a>). He is the progenitor of the ancient Cimmerians, who according to Ezekiel’s prophecy would join with Gog, the leader of the Magogites, in an effort to stamp out Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek38:6\">Ez 38:6</a>).</p><p>2. Diblaim’s daughter, a prostitute, who then became the wife of Hosea by divine command. Having borne Hosea children, she lapsed into immorality but was redeemed. Her behavior served as an illustration of Israel’s infidelity to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos3:5\">Hos 1–3</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5086\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hosea (Person)</span>.</p>",
