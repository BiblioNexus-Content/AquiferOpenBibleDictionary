    "content": "<h1>JOSIAH</h1><p>1. Sixteenth king of the southern kingdom of Judah (640–609 BC). A godly man, he stood in marked contrast to his grandfather Manasseh and his father, Amon. In fact, Scripture declares there was no king either before or after him who was as obedient to the law of Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:25\">2&nbsp;Kgs 23:25</a>). The Greek form of his name, Josias, appears in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:10-Matt1:11\">Matthew 1:10–11</a> (kjv). The Greek form of his name, Josias, appears in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:10-Matt1:11\">Matthew 1:10–11</a> (kjv).</p><p>The Era of Josiah</p><p>When Josiah became king in 640 BC, the international scene was about to change drastically. After the great Assyrian king Ashurbanipal died in 633 BC, mediocre rulers followed him on the throne, and there was considerable unrest in the empire. Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, seized the kingship in Babylon and established the Neo-Babylonian Empire late in 626 BC. Soon Babylonians and Medes combined forces to topple the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC completely destroyed the city of Nineveh. As Babylonian power rose in the east, Assyrian control over the province that had once been the kingdom of Israel relaxed and Assyrian pressure on Judah virtually ceased. After the fall of Nineveh, the Assyrians established their capital at Haran. There they were defeated by Babylonians and Scythians in 610 BC. At that point Pharaoh Neco II of Egypt decided to support Assyria. In the late spring of 609 BC he advanced through Judah, defeated and killed Josiah, and spent the summer campaigning in Syria. At this time, the international political landscape was undergoing significant changes. After the death of the powerful Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 633 BC, weaker rulers took his place and the empire was in a state of unrest. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was established in 626 BC by Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar. The Babylonians and Medes joined forces to overthrow the Assyrian Empire, ultimately destroying the city of Nineveh in 612 BC. As the Babylonian Empire grew in power, Assyrian control over the former kingdom of Israel weakened and their pressure on Judah diminished. After the fall of Nineveh, the Assyrians relocated their capital to Haran, where they were later defeated by the Babylonians and Scythians in 610 BC. It was at this point that Pharaoh Neco II of Egypt decided to support Assyria, leading to his defeat of Josiah in 609 BC and subsequent campaign in Syria.</p><p>Before Josiah’s reign, Judah had given in to gross idolatry during the reign of Manasseh (697–642 BC). Baalism, Molech worship, and other pagan religions had spread throughout the land, as well as occultism and astrology. A false altar even stood in the temple in Jerusalem, and human sacrifice to pagan deities was practiced near Jerusalem. The nation was completely corrupt. Although some reform occurred in Manasseh’s later years, conditions returned to their previous depravity during the reign of his son Amon (642–640 BC). In 640 BC officials of Amon’s household assassinated him, and the “people of the land” put Josiah on the throne (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:26\">2&nbsp;Kgs 21:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:1\">22:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr33:25-2Chr34:1\">2&nbsp;Chr 33:25–34:1</a>).</p><p>Josiah’s Activities of Reform</p><p>Josiah was only eight years old when he became king. Evidently he had spiritually motivated advisers or regents; by the time he was 16, he began of his own accord “to seek the God of his ancestor David” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr34:3\">2&nbsp;Chr 34:3</a>). When he was 20, he became greatly exercised over the idolatry of the land and launched a major effort to eradicate the pagan high places, groves, and images from Judah and Jerusalem. So intense was Josiah’s hatred of idolatry that he even opened the tombs of pagan priests and burned their bones on pagan altars before the altars were destroyed. Josiah was only eight years old when he became king. It is believed that he had advisors or regents who were motivated by their faith. By the time he was 16, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David on his own. When he was 20, he became very concerned about the idolatry in the land and made a major effort to remove the pagan high places, groves, and images from Judah and Jerusalem. Josiah had such a strong dislike for idolatry that he even opened the tombs of pagan priests and burned their bones on pagan altars before destroying the altars.</p><p>Josiah carried out his reform movement beyond the borders of Judah, expressing his anger particularly towards the cult center at Bethel, where Jeroboam had established his false worship. In fulfillment of prophecy (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:1-1Kgs13:3\">1&nbsp;Kgs 13:1–3</a>), he destroyed the altar and high place and burned the bones of the officiating priests to defile the site (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:15-2Kgs23:18\">2&nbsp;Kgs 23:15–18</a>). What he did at Bethel, he did throughout the kingdom of Samaria (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:15-2Kgs23:20\">19–20</a>).</p><p>When Josiah was 26, he launched a project to cleanse and repair the temple in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:3\">2&nbsp;Kgs 22:3</a>). Shaphan, the king’s administrative assistant, commissioned the work; Hilkiah the priest supervised the renovation and construction. In the process of restoring the temple, Hilkiah found the Book of the Law, the nature and contents of which are otherwise unknown. Possibly in the dark days of Manasseh a deliberate attempt had been made to destroy the Word of God. At any rate, there was little knowledge of Scripture in Judah.</p><p>When Shaphan read the Book of the Law to Josiah, the king was deeply troubled by the warnings of punishment for turning away from God. He sent a delegation to Huldah the prophetess to inquire about the consequences for the land. The prophetess responded that God&apos;s condemnation would indeed come upon Judah for their wrongdoing, but she also assured Josiah that because his heart was devoted to God, the punishment would not occur during his lifetime.</p><p>The ruler summoned a large group of representatives for a public reading of the law—specifically sections that focused on responsibilities to God. The ruler and the people made an agreement before God to follow his commandments.</p><p>Faced with the importance of maintaining a pure monotheistic faith, the king was spurred on to even more rigorous efforts to cleanse the temple and Jerusalem. He destroyed the vessels used in Baal worship, the monument of horses given by the kings of Judah for sun worship, the chariots dedicated to the sun, the homosexual community near the temple, and shrines built by Solomon and in use since his day. Moreover, he made stringent efforts to eliminate the pagan shrines and high places in all the towns of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:4-2Kgs23:14\">2&nbsp;Kgs 23:4–14</a>).</p><p>The Passing of Josiah</p><p>The exact reason why Josiah opposed Pharaoh Neco’s advance through Judean territory is unknown. He may have wanted to prevent aid from reaching the hated Assyrians or to maintain his own independence. Josiah was mortally wounded in the conflict and was greatly lamented by Jeremiah and all the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr35:25\">2&nbsp;Chr 35:25</a>). Well they might weep, for their godly king was gone, and within a few years the judgment withheld during his lifetime would descend on the nation.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3720\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Chronology of the Bible (Old Testament)</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5260\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Israel, History of</span>.</p><p>2.
