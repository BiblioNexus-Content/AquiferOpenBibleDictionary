    "content": "<h1>NAZARENE</h1><p>A Nazarene is someone who comes from the town of Nazareth. Nazareth was a town in the southern part of Galilee during the time of Jesus.</p><h2>Why Was Jesus Called a Nazarene?</h2><p>Jesus lived in Nazareth for the first 30 years of his life, so people called him a Nazarene. The name Jesus was a common name among the Jews. Surnames were not used, so identifying Jesus as a Nazarene may have differentiated him from others with the same name (see Greek texts of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:16-Matt27:17\">Matthew 27:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:45\">Acts 7:45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:11\">Colossians 4:11</a>; and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:8\">Hebrews 4:8</a>, where the name Jesus refers to other men).</p><p>In original texts, the designation Jesus the Nazarene (or Jesus of Nazareth) was used by:</p><ul><li><p>demons (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark1:24\">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:34\">Luke 4:34</a>)</p></li><li><p>the crowd outside Jericho (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:47\">Mark 10:47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:37\">Luke 18:37</a>)</p></li><li><p>a servant girl (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark14:67\">Mark 14:67</a>)</p></li><li><p>soldiers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:5-John18:7\">John 18:5–7</a>)</p></li><li><p>Pilate (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:19\">John 19:19</a>)</p></li><li><p>the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:19\">Luke 24:19</a>)</p></li><li><p>the angel at the tomb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark16:6\">Mark 16:6</a>)</p></li></ul><p>The apostles in Acts use Nazareth to identify Jesus:</p><ul><li><p>Peter speaks of &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; in his sermon on the day of Pentecost (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:22\">Acts 2:22</a>).</p></li><li><p> Peter speaks of &quot;Jesus Christ of Nazareth&quot; while healing someone at the temple gate (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:6\">Acts 3:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:10\">4:10</a>).</p></li><li><p>Paul refers to &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts26:9\">Acts 26:9</a>.</p></li></ul><p>People sometimes used &quot;Nazarene&quot; in a negative way when talking about Jesus. For example, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:14\">Acts 6:14</a>, some people brought false charges against Stephen, one of Jesus&apos;s early followers. They took Stephen to the Jewish religious court (called the Sanhedrin) and said, &quot;This Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place [temple] and alter the customs that Moses handed down to us.&quot; </p><p>There is another negative use of the word &quot;Nazarene&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:5\">Acts 24:5</a>. This is the only place in the Bible where Jesus&apos;s followers are called &quot;Nazarenes.&quot; In this passage, a man named Tertullus accused Paul in front of Roman leaders. He said, &quot;<span>We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.&quot;</span></p><h2><span>What Does Matthew&apos;s Prophecy About a Nazarene Mean?</span></h2><p>The Bible&apos;s use of the name &quot;Nazarene&quot; raises an interesting question in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt2:23\">Matthew 2:23</a>. The verse says, &quot;<span>And he went and lived in a town called Nazareth.</span> <span>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: &apos;He will be called a Nazarene.&apos;&quot;</span> No Old Testament prophecy says that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. </p><p>Scholars have different explanations for what Matthew meant. Some scholars look at <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1\">Isaiah 11:1</a> in the Old Testament, where it describes the Messiah as a &quot;Branch.&quot; In the Hebrew language, the word for &quot;Branch&quot; is similar to the word &quot;Nazareth.&quot; These scholars think Matthew was showing this connection.</p><p>Other scholars have a different explanation. They point out that the Old Testament said people would reject the Messiah. During Jesus&apos;s time, people looked down on anyone who came from Nazareth. This was especially significant because everyone knew the Messiah was supposed to be born in Bethlehem, the hometown of King David.</p><p>Jesus was born in Bethlehem, but he grew up in Nazareth. People called him a Nazarene because he came from Nazareth, and they often made fun of him for this. Many people in Jesus&apos;s time treated anyone from Nazareth with disrespect. When people treated Jesus this way because he was from Nazareth, it showed that the Old Testament prophecies were coming true (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:46\">John 1:46</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:54\">Matthew 13:54</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:2-Mark6:3\">Mark 6:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:22\">Luke 4:22</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6487\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Nazareth</span>.</p>",
