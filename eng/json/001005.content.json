    "content": "<h1>BLOODGUILT</h1><p>Bloodguilt refers to being responsible for someone&apos;s death. In the Bible, this term comes from a Hebrew word that means &quot;blood&quot; or &quot;bloods&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod22:2-Exod22:3\">Exodus 22:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev17:4\">Leviticus 17:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:26,1Sam25:33\">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:26, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos12:14\">Hosea 12:14</a>). When someone killed another person, they were said to have &quot;shed blood&quot; and became guilty of that person&apos;s death.</p><p>The translation “bloodguiltiness” is only used in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:14\">Psalm 51:14</a>. When the Hebrew word is used in its plural form, it usually means someone has killed another person. In its singular form, the word can mean three things:</p><ul><li><p>Blood itself</p></li><li><p>The act of killing someone</p></li><li><p>Being guilty of killing someone</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the Bible, we see that killing someone was punished by death. In biblical times, killing often happened by shedding another&apos;s blood.</p><h2>Types of Bloodguilt</h2><p>The first type of bloodguilt was when someone deliberately killed another person on purpose. The Old Testament calls this killing &quot;innocent blood&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah1:14\">Jonah 1:14</a>). The Bible explains what happens when someone kills an innocent person and how they should be punished (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:6\">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut19:11-Deut19:13\">Deuteronomy 19:11–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:4\">2&nbsp;Kings 24:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek33:6\">Ezekiel 33:6</a>). According to the Bible, if someone commits murder, they cannot pay money to avoid punishment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:31\">Numbers 35:31</a>).</p><p>Another type of bloodguilt was when someone killed another person by accident (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:28\">Numbers 35:9–28</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut19:4-Deut19:10\">Deuteronomy 19:4–10</a>). In these cases, the person who caused the death could go to special cities called &quot;cities of refuge&quot; to be safe. If they left these cities, they could be killed by a family member of the dead person who was given the right to seek justice. This family member was called an &quot;avenger of blood.&quot;</p><p>Sometimes, a dead person would be found, and no one knew who killed them. When this happened, the closest town was held responsible for the death. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut21:1-Deut21:9\">Deuteronomy 21:1–9</a> explains a special ceremony these towns could perform to remove this responsibility.</p><p>In ancient Israel, people could become guilty of wrongful killing even when dealing with animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev17:3-Lev17:4,Lev17:10-Lev17:11\">Leviticus 17:3–4, 10–11</a>). If an animal killed someone, the animal would be put to death by stoning (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod21:28-Exod21:29\">Exodus 21:28–29</a>). </p><p>There were some situations where killing did not lead to guilt:</p><ul><li><p>Protecting yourself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod22:2\">Exodus 22:2</a>)</p></li><li><p>Carrying out legal executions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:9-Lev20:16\">Leviticus 20:9–16</a>)</p></li><li><p>Killing during war (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:5–6</a>)</p></li></ul><p>The prophets often used the word for &quot;blood&quot; to talk about the guilt of the entire nation of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:15\">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa4:4\">4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek7:23\">Ezekiel 7:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek9:9\">9:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos1:4\">Hosea 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos4:2\">4:2</a>, in the King James Version; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic3:10\">Micah 3:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:8,Hab2:12,Hab2:17\">Habakkuk 2:8, 12, 17</a>). </p><p>Some crimes were considered so serious that they were punished by death, even though they did not involve killing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:9-Lev20:16\">Leviticus 20:9–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek18:10-Ezek18:13\">Ezekiel 18:10–13</a>). These crimes included: </p><ul><li><p>Worshiping false gods</p></li><li><p>Worshiping objects as gods (idols)</p></li><li><p>Being unfaithful in marriage (adultery)</p></li><li><p>Stealing (robbery)</p></li><li><p>Being cruel to poor people</p></li><li><p>Breaking important promises</p></li><li><p>Charging unfair interest on loans</p></li></ul><p>Throughout the Bible, from Genesis (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:12\">4:10–12</a>) to the Prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:21\">Isaiah 26:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek24:6-Ezek24:9\">Ezekiel 24:6–9</a>) and into the New Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev6:10\">Revelation 6:10</a>), we learn that God will bring justice and punish those who kill others.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3738\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Cities of Refuge</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3861\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Criminal Law and Punishment</span>.</p>",
