    "content": "<h1>COUNSEL, COUNSELOR</h1><p>Counsel is advice. A counselor is someone who gives advice, especially on legal matters. Lawyers are often called counselors. In Bible times, a counselor in a king’s court was like a political cabinet member today. A counselor might sometimes have been in line to succeed the king. </p><h2>Counselors in the Bible</h2><p>Ahithophel was a counselor to David and Absalom. He gave advice that was so trustworthy it was as if it came directly from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:23\">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:23</a>). The elders of Israel counseled King Rehoboam (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:6\">1&nbsp;Kings 12:6</a>). So did Rehoboam&apos;s childhood friends (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:7-1Kgs12:8\">7</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:7-1Kgs12:8\">8</a>), although his friends gave poor advice. The Bible mentions official counselors in Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa19:11\">Isaiah 19:11</a>) and Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3\">Daniel 3:2</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3\">3</a>).</p><p>A wise person seeks counsel when making plans: &quot;<span>Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov15:22\">Proverbs 15:22</a>). Counselors may be:</p><ul><li><p>one’s parents (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov1:8\">1:8</a>) </p></li><li><p>older people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek7:26\">Ezekiel 7:26</a>) </p></li><li><p>prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr25:16\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 25:16</a>)</p></li><li><p>wise men (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:18\">Jeremiah 18:18</a>)</p></li><li><p>friends (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov27:9\">Proverbs 27:9</a>) </p></li></ul><p>Some counselors are evil and give advice meant to deceive people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov12:5\">Proverbs 12:5</a>).</p><h2>God as a Counselor</h2><p>According to the Bible, God also counsels. He frustrates the counsel of the nations who oppose him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:10\">Psalms 33:10</a>). But, God&apos;s own counsel endures for many generations (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:11\">11</a>). No one may counsel the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa40:13\">Isaiah 40:13</a>). His chosen leader, the Messiah, is called “Wonderful Counselor” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:6\">9:6</a>).</p><p>According to the New Testament, the Holy Spirit counsels or comforts believers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:16-John14:17\">John 14:16–17</a>). Christ sends the Holy Spirit to his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:7\">16:7</a>). The Holy Spirit, also called the Spirit of truth, bears witness to Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:26\">15:26</a>). Jesus Christ, after he rose to heaven, is seen as a counselor in God’s heavenly court (described as an &quot;advocate&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:1\">1&nbsp;John 2:1</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7769\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Spirit of God</span>.</p>",
