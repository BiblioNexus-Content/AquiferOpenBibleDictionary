    "content": "<h1>BENJAMIN (Person)</h1><ol><li><p>The youngest of Jacob’s 12 sons and full brother to Joseph. Jacob named him Benjamin (“son of my right hand”) after his dying mother Rachel had called him Ben-oni (“son of my sorrow,” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:18\">Genesis 35:18</a>). After Joseph had been sold into Egypt by his half brothers, their father, Jacob, assumed that Joseph was dead and became very protective of Benjamin. Later, because of a plan created by Joseph, Benjamin was used to help reunite Jacob with his 12 sons in Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen45:28\">Genesis 42–45</a>). In a prophecy about his sons, Jacob spoke of Benjamin’s skill as a warrior or predicted the military power of his tribe by saying, “<span>Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:27\">Genesis 49:27</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3282\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Benjamin, Tribe of</span>.</p></li><li><p>Bilhan’s son and Jacob’s great-grandson (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr7:10\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 7:10</a>).</p></li><li><p>Member of Harim’s clan after the exile in Babylon who married a non-Jewish wife (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:32\">Ezra 10:32</a>).</p></li><li><p>One who repaired a section of the wall next to his own house (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:23\">Nehemiah 3:23</a>).</p></li><li><p>One of the company of Jews who participated in the dedication of the wall at Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:34\">Nehemiah 12:34</a>).
