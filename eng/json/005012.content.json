Two brief references in the OT (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:31\">Jgs 3:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:6\">5:6</a>) tell us little of the man except for his one major exploit: the killing of 600 Philistines with an oxgoad. How such a feat was performed is not recorded. The oxgoad could have had a sharpened metal tip and may have been used as a spear. The timing of the reference indicates that his deeds took place early in the period of Philistine settlement in Canaan. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:6\">Judges 5:6</a> would place him prior to the battle of Kishon (c. 1125 BC).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5658\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judges, Book of</span>.</p>",
