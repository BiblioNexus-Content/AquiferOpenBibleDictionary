    "content": "<h1>HUSHAI</h1><p>Hushai was a friend and adviser of King David. Hushai remained loyal to King David when Absalom, David&apos;s son, rebelled against him. Hushai&apos;s fellow adviser, Ahithophel, left David and joined Absalom&apos;s rebellion. </p><p>Following David&apos;s instructions, Hushai pretended to be loyal to Absalom. This allowed him to secretly send information to David about Absalom&apos;s plans. Ahithophel urged Absalom to attack David before he could gather mother soldiers. BHowever, Absalom chose to follow Hushai&apos;s advice instead. Hushai&apos;s advice gave David time to escape across the Jordan River and eventually defeat Absalom&apos;s forces.</p><p>When Ahithophel saw that Absalom did not follow his advice, he hanged himself. He probably knew that Absalom would lose the battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:32-2Sam15:37\">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:32–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:15-2Sam17:23\">16:15–17:23</a>). </p><p>Hushai belonged to the Archite family from Ataroth, a town on the border of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh16:2,Josh16:7\">Joshua 16:2, 7</a>).</p>",
