    "content": "<h1>CAIN (Person)</h1><p>The first son of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2531\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Adam</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4362\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Eve.</span> He became a tiller of the soil while his brother, <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2449\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Abel</span>, was a keeper of sheep. When people talk about terrible acts of violence, they often mention Cain&apos;s murder of his brother Abel as an example (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jude1:11\">Jude 1:11</a>). Each of the two brothers had brought a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7258\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">sacrifice</span> to the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:4\">Genesis 4:3–4</a>). According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:4\">Hebrews 11:4</a>, Abel had acted in faith by bringing a more acceptable sacrifice than that of Cain. Cain became very angry because God did not accept his offering. Because God accepted Abel&apos;s offering but not his own, Cain killed his brother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:5-Gen4:8\">Genesis 4:5–8</a>). </p><p>When explaining why Cain acted with violence, the Bible tells us that he belonged to the evil one (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:12\">1&nbsp;John 3:12</a>). The Lord confronted Cain with his guilt, judged him, and pronounced a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3881\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">curse</span> upon him. God made Cain leave the land of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6587\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Nod</span>, east of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4107\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Eden</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:9-Gen4:16\">Genesis 4:9–16</a>). Cain complained to God that his punishment was greater than he could bear. He was afraid that someone would find him and kill him. So, the Lord put a mark on Cain to protect him. The Lord also promised that if anyone killed Cain, that person would receive punishment seven times worse.</p><p>In the land of Nod, Cain built a city and named it after his son <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4256\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Enoch</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:17\">Genesis 4:17</a>). Through Enoch, Cain had many descendants. In the early generations, these descendants developed different skills. Some lived in tents and took care of animals. Others became <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6415\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">musicians</span>, and some learned how to make things from metal (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:18-Gen4:22\">18–22</a>).</p>",
