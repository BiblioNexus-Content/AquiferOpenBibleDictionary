    "content": "<h1>NURSE</h1><p>A nurse was a woman who took care of an infant that was not her own, or a man who took care of young children. The work focused on feeding and caring for an infant. Most women took care of their own children, like Sarah and Hannah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:7\">Genesis 21:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:23\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:23</a>). </p><p>A wet nurse (a woman who breastfeeds another woman&apos;s child) often became part of the family and had a special position. Rebekah had a nurse, and when this woman died, she was even mentioned in the Bible: “<span>Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:8\">Genesis 35:8</a>). </p><p>Moses&apos;s mother became his nurse when Pharaoh&apos;s daughter paid her to care for him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:7\">Exodus 2:7</a>). Royal sons were cared for by nurses, as in the case of Joash. His aunt Jehosheba hid him with his nurse (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:2</a>). Since Joash was hidden for six years and was seven when he became king, he was about one year old when he was hidden. His nurse must have been a wet nurse.</p><p>Royal sons received special care and were supervised by a nurse after they finished breastfeeding. Children were nursed until about three years old, and when they were weaned (stopped breastfeeding), there was a feast (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:8\">Genesis 21:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:23-1Sam1:24\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:23–24</a>). After weaning, a nurse-teacher took charge of the child. Mephibosheth was five years old when his nurse fell while carrying him. This caused him to be unable to walk properly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam4:4\">2&nbsp;Samuel 4:4</a>). Naomi took care of her grandson as a nurse (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:16\">Ruth 4:16</a>). </p><p>It is likely that male nurses worked as teachers for young nobles. For example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1\">2&nbsp;Kings 10:1</a> says that Ahab’s children had tutors (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:5\">2 Kings 10:5</a>). In this way, we should understand Moses&apos;s reference to himself as a “nurse”: “<span>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers?</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:12\">Numbers 11:12</a>). Paul also saw himself as a “nurse” to the church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess2:7\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:7</a>).</p>",
