    "content": "<h1>ABIGAIL</h1><ol><li><p>Nabal’s wife, who later became the wife of David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:2-1Sam25:42\">1&nbsp;Samuel 25:2–42</a>). Nabal was a wealthy sheep owner whose flockes had been protected by David’s men. When David asked Nabal for food in return, Nabal said no. This made David very angry. He took 400 armed men to attack Nabal and his household. Abigail heard what her husband had done. She quickly gathered food and met David on the way. She apologized for her husband&apos;s foolish behavior. David thanked God for using Abigail to stop him from doing something wrong.</p><p>The next morning, Nabal woke up after drinking too much. When he heard what happened, he had a stroke (a sudden illness that affects the brain). He died 10 days later. </p><p>Abigail then married David and lived with him among the Philistines(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:3\">1&nbsp;Samuel 27:3</a>). Later, she was captured by the Amalekites and rescued by David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:1–19</a>). Abigail went with David to Hebron when he became king of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam2:2\">2&nbsp;Samuel 2:2</a>). She bore his second son, Chileab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:3\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:3</a>), also called Daniel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr3:1\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 3:1</a>).</p></li><li><p>David’s sister, who married Jether and gave birth to Amasa (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16-1Chr2:17\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:16–17</a>). There is some confusion about Abigail&apos;s father. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13-1Chr2:17\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:13–17</a> she is listed as a daughter of Jesse. However, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:25\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:25</a>, her father is identified as Nahash. The difference could be because a scribe made an error when copying the text, or Nahash may be another name for Jesse, or the widow of Nahash could have married Jesse.</p></li></ol>",
