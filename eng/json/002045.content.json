It was apparently named for Appius Claudius. He was the builder of the Appian Way. The Appian Way was a major highway from southeast Italy running northwest to Rome. </p><p>Around the forum was a region of swamp and marsh. It was notorious in the ancient world for bad water, mosquitoes, expensive taverns for travelers, nighttime noisy traffic of cargoes, and passengers on mule-drawn barges along a canal cut through the area. The Appian Way passes through the Appius Forum about 64 kilometers (40 miles) south of Rome.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"2846\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Appian Way</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4467\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Forum</span>.</p>",
