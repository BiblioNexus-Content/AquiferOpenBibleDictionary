    "content": "<h1>SHEMA, The</h1><p>The declaration “Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God is one Yahweh” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4\">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). The name, Shema, comes from the first Hebrew word of the verse, <em>shema,</em> “hear.” <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9\">Deuteronomy 6:4</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9\">9</a> contains all of this essential biblical truth. While several translations of verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4\">4</a> are grammatically correct, Jesus’s words in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:29\">Mark 12:29 </a>match the above translation best. Religious Jews pray the Shema three times a day as a devotion. No Sabbath worship occurs in the synagogue without it.</p><p>The Shema contains a key doctrinal truth and an obligation. The Shema demands that the hearers respond with their total being to this important revelation.</p><p>Regarding the nature of God, the word “one” (<em>echad</em>) means a compound unity, not an absolute singular. The medieval Jewish theologian Maimonides argued that God was <em>yachid</em> (an absolute singular). But, the Old Testament does not use this word to describe God. The word &quot;<em>echad</em>&quot; first occurs in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:24\">Genesis 2:24,</a> where a man and woman are made one (<em>echad</em>) in marriage. This is how Jesus could quote <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4\">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> without denying his own deity.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3992\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Deuteronomy, Book of</span>.</p>",
