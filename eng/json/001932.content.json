    "content": "<h1>EUTYCHUS</h1><p>A young man whose name was common among slaves. Eutychus appears only once in the Bible, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:9\">Acts 20:9</a>. The name Eutychus comes from Greek origins and means &quot;fortunate&quot; or &quot;good fortune.&quot; This meaning creates an interesting contrast with his story. </p><p>Eutychus appears in a story about an accident that happened while the apostle Paul was preaching in the city of Troas. Eutychus was sitting on a windowsill listening to Paul&apos;s long sermon. As the night went on, Eutychus became very sleepy. He fell into a deep sleep and then fell from the window, which was on the third floor of the building. People thought he was dead from the fall, but the apostle Paul went down to him and brought him back to life (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:7-Acts20:12\">7â€“12</a>).</p>",
