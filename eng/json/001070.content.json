    "content": "<h1>BRANCH</h1><p>A branch is a shoot or sprout that grows from a tree or bush. In the Bible, this word has both literal and symbolic meanings.</p><p>In its literal sense, &quot;branch&quot; refers to the three sets of arms that extend from the main shaft of the golden lampstand in the tabernacle (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:31-Exod25:36\">Exodus 25:31–36</a>). The word is also used for the palm branches that people used to build temporary shelters during the ancient Jewish Feast of Tabernacles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:40-Lev23:43\">Leviticus 23:40–43</a>).</p><p>In its figurative sense, &quot;branch&quot; is used as a symbol in prophecies about the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one) and in other spiritual teachings. In the Bible, metaphoric uses of &quot;branch&quot; appear in several passages. Israel is described as different types of plants with branches:</p><ul><li><p>an olive tree (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos14:6\">Hosea 14:6</a>),</p></li><li><p>a cedar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek17:23\">Ezekiel 17:23</a>), and</p></li><li><p>a vine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek17:6\">Ezekiel 17:6</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps80:8-Ps80:11\">Psalm 80:8–11</a>).</p></li></ul><p>The image of a &quot;branch&quot; with its new growth often represents prosperity and blessing in the Bible (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:22\">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:16\">Job 8:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps80:8-Ps80:11\">Psalm 80:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek36:8\">Ezekiel 36:8</a>). </p><p>Branches can also symbolize judgment when they are described as being cut off, broken off, withered, or burned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job18:16\">Job 18:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:14\">Isaiah 9:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:16\">Jeremiah 11:16</a>). Jesus combined three of these ideas (withering, being cut, or being burned) into one metaphor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:6\">John 15:6</a>). In a similar way, the apostle Paul wrote that the Jews who did not believe would be broken off like branches (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom11:19-Rom11:21\">Romans 11:19–21</a>).</p><p>The most important use of branch symbolism in the Bible refers to the promised Messiah from King David&apos;s family line. Although this symbolism became common during the time of the prophets, its origins go back much earlier in the Bible. The concept of a &quot;branch&quot; was used to describe important people such as:</p><ul><li><p>a king’s personal servant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen40:9-Gen40:13\">Genesis 40:9–13</a>),</p></li><li><p>the patriarch Joseph (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen49:22\">Genesis 49:22</a>),</p></li><li><p>Job (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job29:19\">Job 29:19</a>), or</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Assyria (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan4:12\">Daniel 4:12</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Passages such as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:4\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:4</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps132:17\">Psalm 132:17</a> speak of the Davidic line as “growing” or “sprouting forth” (which is the literal meaning of the Hebrew verbs used in these verses). Finally, images of a bountiful harvest were used to describe the blessings that would come when the Messiah would come and rule (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46\">Leviticus 26</a> with the prophetic passages mentioned earlier). From these earlier uses, it makes sense how the term &quot;branch&quot; eventually became a special title for the Messiah in later prophecies.</p>",
