    "content": "<h1>BRAMBLE</h1><p>The Palestinian bramble (<em>Rubus sanctus</em>) and the closely related elm-leaf bramble (<em>Rubus ulmifolius</em>) are prickly evergreen shrubs that spread by growing new shoots from their roots. The stems and young shoots are covered with a characteristic whitish powder or bloom and short hairs. The prickles are strong, stand upright, and have hair on them.</p><p>The flowers of these brambles can be white, pink, rose, or purple in color. The fruit is round and black. In the Bible, &quot;bramble&quot; is a translation of several different words that describe shrubs with prickly stems and runners. These plants often form tangled masses of vegetation.</p>",
