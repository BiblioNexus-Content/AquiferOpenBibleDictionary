Son of Ishmael, Abraham’s grandson, and the father of an Arabian tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:14\">Gn 25:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:30\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:30</a>).</p><p>2. Mibsam’s son from Simeon’s tribe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:25-1Chr4:26\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:25–26</a>). His omission in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:34\">Genesis 25</a> and inclusion in the 1&nbsp;Chronicles genealogy may indicate either that he was born after Jacob moved his family to Egypt or that he represented an Arabian tribe that affiliated with Simeon when Simeon’s tribe expanded to the south (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:38-1Chr4:43\">1&nbsp;Chr 4:38–43</a>).</p>",
