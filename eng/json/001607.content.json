    "content": "<h1>DISCIPLE</h1><p>A disciple is someone who follows another person and learns from their teachings. </p><h2>Disciples in the Gospels and Early Church</h2><p>The word &quot;disciple&quot; appears most often in the Gospels and the book of Acts in the Bible. The word also appears a few times in the Old Testament <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa8:16\">Isaiah 8:16</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa50:4\">Isaiah 50:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:13\">54:13</a>). In Hebrew, the original language of the Old Testament, this word can mean both &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;taught.&quot; Wherever there are teachers and students, there is discipleship. Discipleship is the process of learning from and following a teacher.</p><p>In the Gospels, Jesus&apos;s followers are called “disciples.” Some of these were a special group called &quot;the Twelve,&quot; but Jesus had many other followers too. These people accepted Jesus&apos;s teachings and followed him faithfully. At this time, other religious teachers also had disciples. The Pharisees (a group of Jewish religious leaders) had followers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:18\">Mark 2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:33\">Luke 5:33</a>). John the Baptist also had his own disciples (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:14\">Matthew 9:14</a>). Different leaders asked their followers to do different things. John&apos;s way was more strict than Jesus&apos;s, but both involved teaching about behavior and life and a special way of praying (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:1\">Luke 11:1</a>).</p><p>Jesus&apos;s disciples had a special experience. They learned from Jesus in person. They could see his face, hear his voice, and listen to his words directly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:21\">Mark 10:21</a>). They also saw God&apos;s plan for salvation happening with their own eyes, with Jesus at its center. They followed a teacher whose actions matched his teachings.</p><p>The first disciples learned slowly from Jesus for multiple reasons:</p><ul><li><p>They had wrong ideas that needed to be corrected (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:21\">Matthew 16:21</a>).</p></li><li><p>They could not fully understand Jesus&apos;s words and actions until after he died and came back to life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:9\">Matthew 28:9</a>). </p></li></ul><p>The disciples continued to learn even after Jesus went back to heaven when the Holy Spirit taught them things they could not understand while Jesus remained on earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:12\">John 16:12</a>).</p><h2>The Role of Disciples in Spreading the Good News</h2><p>Jesus had different groups of followers, including the Twelve (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:20\">Matthew 26:20</a>). He also chose 72 other people to be his special messengers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:1\">Luke 10:1</a>; some manuscripts say there were 70 instead of 72). These disciples learned from Jesus and then taught other people about Jesus&apos;s message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:1-Luke10:11\">Luke 10:1–11</a>). They healed sick people through God&apos;s power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt10:1\">Matthew 10:1</a>). They told others how Jesus could save them from their sins.</p><p>The Twelve had a very important role. They became the main teachers of the new Christian church after Jesus returned to heaven. Jesus gave them special power and responsibility in the church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:19\">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:16-Matt28:20\">28:16–20</a>). However, Jesus taught them that they should use this power by helping and serving others, not by controlling them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:24-Luke22:30\">Luke 22:24–30</a>). When Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and died, the other disciples chose Matthias to take his place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:26\">Acts 1:26</a>).</p><p>These twelve men became known as apostles (special messengers). Later, God chose one more apostle: Saul of Tarsus, who was also called Paul. On his way to a city called Damascus, Paul saw Jesus who had risen from death. Jesus gave Paul a special task (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:12,Gal1:16\">Galatians 1:12, 16</a>). God chose Paul to be the apostle to the gentiles and teach non-Jewish people about the good news of Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:15\">Acts 9:15</a>).</p><p>Before he went to heaven, Jesus told the first disciples to “make disciples of all nations” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:19\">Matthew 28:19</a>). So in the book of Acts, “disciple” is also used to describe believers who accept Jesus. These later disciples are called by Jesus&apos;s Spirit through the message of the first disciples. </p><p>The early Christians were called “the disciples” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:2,Acts6:7\">Acts 6:1–2, 7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:36\">9:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts11:26\">11:26</a>). This was a good name for them because they followed Jesus&apos;s teachings and lived the way Jesus had shown them to live. These Christians lived together as a community and followed Jesus&apos;s teachings in their daily lives. The book of 1 John teaches that people show they love God by doing what Jesus taught them to do (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:3-1John2:6\">1&nbsp;John 2:3–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:10-1John3:11\">3:10–11</a>).</p>",
