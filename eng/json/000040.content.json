In some translations, Abihail seems to be the second wife of Rehoboam. However, only one wife is listed at first. Abihail was probably the mother of Rehoboam’s first wife, Mahalath. So, Abihail was a daughter of Eliab, David’s eldest brother. She married her cousin Jerimoth, one of David’s sons.</p></li><li><p>Esther’s father, and uncle of Mordecai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth2:15\">Esther 2:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Esth9:29\">9:29</a>).</p></li></ol>",
