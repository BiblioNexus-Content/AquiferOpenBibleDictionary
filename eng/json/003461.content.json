It has thin stems and leaves with tendrils (small, curling parts that help the plant climb or hold onto things).</p><p>The plant produces small white flowers with violet stripes. Its seeds grow in flat pods that look similar to pea pods. These seeds are the lentils that people eat.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4454\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Food and Food Preparation</span>.</p>",
