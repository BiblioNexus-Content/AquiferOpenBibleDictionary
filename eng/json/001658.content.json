    "content": "<h1>DYSENTERY</h1><p>Dysentery is a sickness that causes diarrhea (loose, watery bowel movements). It is caused by harmful bacteria, protozoa (tiny one-celled animals called amoeba), or worms that get into food or water.When a person has dysentery, they have painful intestinal cramps and damage to the intestines. Blood and pus appear in their stool (bowel movement).</p><p>On the island of Malta, the apostle Paul cmiraculously healed a person who had dysentery (the Greek word is <em>dysenteria,</em> <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:8\">Acts 28:8</a>). As this verse shows, severe fever comes with acute dysentery. Even today, outbreaks of this disease still affect Malta.</p><p>A disease described in the Old Testament was likely amoebic dysentery. In this type, pieces of intestinal tissue can break off day after day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr21:14-2Chr21:19\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 21:14â€“19</a>). There is also a less severe form of dysentery that happens when the body can mostly fight against the harmful organism.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6179\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Medicine and Medical Practice</span>.</p>",
