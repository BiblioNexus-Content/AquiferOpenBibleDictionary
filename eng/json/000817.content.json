    "content": "<h1>BELIAL, BELIAR</h1><p>A common Hebrew noun meaning “baseness,” “worthlessness,” “wickedness,” or “lawlessness.” Belial, however, is often translated as a name. Thus, sometimes it is translated as “sons of Belial” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg19:22\">Judges 19:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12\">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:12</a>), “daughter of Belial” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:16\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:16</a>), or “children of Belial” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:13\">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:13\">Judges 20:13</a>). Newer translations generally translate it as “worthless rabble” or &quot;worthless” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:13\">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg19:22\">Judges 19:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:13\">20:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam1:16\">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12\">2:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:27\">10:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov6:12\">Proverbs 6:12</a>). One exception is in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Nah1:15\">Nahum 1:15</a>, which some scholars think should be translated “Belial.” This is a personal name of the Assyrian conqueror who threatened to the southern kingdom of Judah.</p><p>Texts from between the two Testaments use “Belial” as a name and influenced how it is used in the New Testament. In the New Testament, the term appears once as “Belial” (or Beliar in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:15\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:15</a>) and is identified with Satan, the representation of evil. Nonbiblical writings from the New Testament period often used Belial as a name for Satan or the Antichrist.</p>",
