    "content": "<h1>GIDEON</h1><p>Gideon was a judge of Israel from the tribe of Manasseh. Gideon was the son of Joash and belonged to the clan of Abiezer. Of the 12 judges of Israel, the Bible says more about Gideon than any other judge. Samson is a close second. Gideon&apos;s story happened about 1,100 years before the time of Christ.</p><h2>God Calls Gideon</h2><p>The Midianites ruled over Israel for seven years. They were very cruel. The people cried out to God for help (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:6\">Judges 6:6</a>). God sent a prophet to tell them why they were suffering. The prophet said it was because they had forgotten the one true God and were not faithful to him.</p><p>Then God sent his angel to Gideon. The angel called Gideon a “mighty warrior” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:12\">Judges 6:12</a>), even though Gideon was hiding while threshing wheat. He was afraid of the Midianites. But God saw what Gideon could do through his power (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:14-Judg6:16,Judg6:34\">14–16, 34</a>). Gideon knew he was weak and the task was big. That made him the right person for God to use. God often works through people who seem weak to show his great power (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:27\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:10\">2&nbsp;Corinthians 12:10</a>).</p><h2>Gideon Destroys the Altar to Baal</h2><p>Gideon’s first task was to destroy his father’s altar to Baal. He also tore down a nearby pole used to worship Asherah, a female false god linked to Baall (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa42:8\">Isaiah 42:8</a>). Gideon knew the people would be angry, so he did this at night with the help of his servants.</p><p>The next day, the men of Ophrah were furious. They wanted to kill Gideon for what he had done. But Gideon’s father, Joash, defended him. He said that if Baal was really a god, Baal could fight for himself.</p><p>After this, people began calling Gideon “Jerubbaal,” which means “Let Baal contend” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:32\">Judges 6:32</a>).</p><h2>Gideon&apos;s Weakness and God&apos;s Strength</h2><p>Gideon sometimes struggled to trust God fully. He asked God for signs to help him feel sure. God did not get angry but kindly gave Gideon what he asked for. One sign was the miracle with the dew and the fleece (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:36-Judg6:40\">Judges 6:36–40</a>). </p><p>Later, God told Gideon that Israel would not win by having a large army. God wanted everyone to know that the victory came from him, not from human strength (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:2\">Judges 7:2</a>). So Gideon’s army was reduced from 32,000 to just 300 men in a special way (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:3-Judg7:7\">3–7</a>). </p><p>That night, Gideon and his servant Purah went near the Midianite camp. They listened as a Midianite soldier told about a dream. The dream showed that Israel would soon win (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:13-Judg7:14\">13–14</a>). This gave Gideon courage, and he worshiped the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:15\">Judges 7:15</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:24\">6:24</a>).</p><h2>The Battle Against the Midianites</h2><p>Gideon divided his 300 men into three groups. At night, they took their places around the Midianite camp. At Gideon’s signal, each man blew a trumpet made from an animal horn. Then they broke jars that hid torches inside and shouted, “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:20\">Judges 7:20</a>). </p><p>The Midianites were shocked and confused. They thought they were being attacked by a large army. In fear, they ran away toward the east, crossing the Jordan River.</p><p>Gideon’s men chased them. Other Israelites from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh also joined the fight. The tribe of Ephraim helped too. They captured and killed two Midianite leaders.</p><p>At first, the men of Ephraim were upset that Gideon had not asked for their help earlier. But Gideon answered them kindly, and they were no longer angry (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:1-Judg8:3\">Judges 8:1–3</a>).</p><h2>Gideon Refuses to Be King</h2><p>After the victory, the people asked Gideon to become their king. But he refused. He reminded them that the Lord was their true ruler (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:22-Judg8:23\">Judges 8:22–23</a>). </p><p>Even though Gideon said no to being king, he still received a large amount of gold from the battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:24-Judg8:26\">Judges 8:24–26</a>). He used the gold to make an object called an ephod. It may have been a garment like the high priest’s or a standing image. Sadly, the people began to worship the ephod. It became a trap for them and for Gideon’s family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:27\">Judges 8:27</a>)</p><p>Later, Gideon’s name Jerubbaal was changed to Jerubbesheth in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:21\">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:21</a>. This change replaced “Baal” with the Hebrew word <em>besheth</em> that means “shame.”</p><h2>Gideon in the New Testament</h2><p>The Letter to the Hebrews names Gideon as one of the heroes of faith. He trusted in God, and his faith brought glory to the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:32\">Hebrews 11:32</a>; King James Version, “Gedeon”). Even in the time of Isaiah, people remembered “the day of Midian” as a time when God saved his people by his own power, not by human strength (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:4\">Isaiah 9:4</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5658\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Judges, Book of</span>.</p>",
