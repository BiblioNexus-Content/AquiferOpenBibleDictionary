Most scholars think that it was the common rue <em>(Rue graveolens)</em>, a perennial shrubby plant with straight stems 0.6 to 0.9 meter (2 to 3 feet) tall and deeply cut leaves. A very strong odor comes from the leaves. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and grows wild in the Holy Land, especially on Mount Tabor.</p><p>Ancient people highly valued rue as a medicine. They believed it could prevent dizziness, inability to speak, epilepsy (seizures), eye inflammations, mental illness, and the &quot;evil eye&quot; (a belief that someone could cause harm by looking at another person). Rue was also used for adding flavor to food.</p>",
