    "content": "<h1>APE</h1><p>A large, tailless primate. Apes, or perhaps other monkeys and baboons, are not native to Palestine. They were imported to Israel by King Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:22\">1&nbsp;Kings 10:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr9:21\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:21</a>). </p><p>There are two references to apes in the Old Testament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:22\">1&nbsp;Kings 10:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr9:21\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 9:21</a>). They discuss Solomon&apos;s importing the apes on his trading ships, with other treasures. There is some question about where those primates came from. Some believe the mention of &quot;ivory&quot; suggests they were apes from East Africa. Others, believing they came from India or Ceylon, suggest that they were actually monkeys. </p><p>Baboons (<em>genus Papeio</em>) were considered sacred to the god Thoth. Males of that genus were kept in temples, and the more tame females were often kept as house pets. Such baboons often had some of their teeth removed or ground down to reduce the risk of their biting. Mummified baboons found in Egypt show they were highly regarded.</p>",
