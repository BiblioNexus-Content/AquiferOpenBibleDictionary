Therefore, Abraham and his descendants are part of the Semitic family of nations.</p></li><li><p>Son of Terah and Abraham’s brother (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29\">Genesis 11:26</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29\">29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:2\">Joshua 24:2</a>). He married Milcah, Haran’s daughter, and his family is named in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23\">Genesis 22:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23\">23</a>. Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac at Nahor’s residence in Mesopotamia (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:10\">Genesis 24:10</a>, which possibly suggests that the city itself was called Nahor). There he found Rebekah, Nahor’s granddaughter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51\">Genesis 24:1</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51\">51</a>). </p><p>Nahor is also named as the father (perhaps grandfather) of Laban, to whom Jacob went when he fled from his brother Esau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen29:5\">Genesis 29:5</a>). Both of these texts link Abraham’s family with related Semitic people. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:53\">Genesis 31:53</a> God is spoken of as “<span>the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor</span>.”</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6459\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Nahor (Place)</span>.</p></li></ol>",
