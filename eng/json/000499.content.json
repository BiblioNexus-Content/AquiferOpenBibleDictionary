The Parthian kingdom under Arsaces VI (Mithridates I) grew to include Media and Persia among other nations. </p><p>This growth brought the Parthians close to Seleucid territory. Syrian king Demetrius Nicator retaliated in 141 BC by invading the kingdom of Arsaces VI, an event recorded in the Apocrypha (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc14:1-1Macc14:3\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 14:1–3</a>). Arsaces was one of the kings advised by the Roman consul not to harm the Jews (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc15:15-1Macc15:22\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 15:15–22</a>).</p>",
