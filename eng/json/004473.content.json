    "content": "<h1>PI-HAHIROTH</h1><p>A place where the Israelites stopped during their journey from Egypt to the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:2\">Exodus 14:2</a>). It was at Pi-hahiroth that the Egyptian army caught up with them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:9\">Exodus 14:9</a>). This led to God&apos;s rescue at the Red Sea. The Israelites always remembered how God saved them at this place.</p><p>The exact location of Pi-hahiroth is not known for certain. Baal-zephon and Migdol were also nearby places mentioned in the same area. After the Israelites left Egypt, they first camped at Succoth in Goshen and then at Etham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num33:6\">Numbers 33:6</a>). After Pi-hahiroth, they travelled for three days to reach Marah and Elim. These places are probably on the east shore of the Gulf of Suez, on the way to Sinai. </p><p>Pi-hahiroth was likely on the northeast border of Egypt, possibly on the west shore of the Bitter Lakes. The Israelites did not travel by the expected northern route called the Way of the Philistines. Instead, they went southeast through the desert (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num13:17-Num13:18\">Exodus 13:17â€“18</a>). Eventually, they returned to the old Egyptian road that led to the copper and turquoise mines of Sinai.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8231\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wilderness Wanderings</span>.</p>",
