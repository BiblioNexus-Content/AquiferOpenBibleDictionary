    "content": "<h1>SECOND LETTER TO THE THESSALONIANS</h1><p>The second letter of the apostle Paul to the church at Thessalonica. It is part of the New Testament.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Who Wrote the Second Letter to the Thessalonians?</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">When and Where Was the Letter Written? Who Was It Written To?</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Why Was the Letter Written?</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">What Is the Message of the Letter?</a></p><h2>Who Wrote the Second Letter to the Thessalonians?</h2><p>Both this letter and 1&nbsp;Thessalonians begin with the names of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. Likewise, both letters often use the plural pronouns “we” and “us” but also the singular “I” (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:5\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:5</a>). At the end of the letter, Paul writes a special note: “<span>This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. This is my mark in every letter; it is the way I write</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:17\">3:17</a>).</p><p>Some scholars have wondered if Paul actually wrote this letter. This is mostly because 2 Thessalonians talks about future events differently than 1&nbsp;Thessalonians. However, if someone other than Paul wrote this letter, they would have been creating a fake letter. This would not make sense because of what Paul wrote in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:17\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:17</a>. The early Christian church always believed that Paul wrote both letters to the Thessalonians.</p><h2>When and Where Was the Second Letter to the Thessalonians Written?  Who Was It Written To?</h2><p>In the first verse, as in 1&nbsp;Thessalonians, Paul addresses the letter “to the church of the Thessalonians.” Unlike 1&nbsp;Thessalonians, this letter does not tell us where Paul and his friends were when they wrote it, or when they wrote it.</p><p>Because there are differences between the teachings of this letter and the teachings of 1 Thessalonians, scholars have different ideas about when and where this letter was written. </p><ol><li><p>Some scholars think Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians much later than 1&nbsp;Thessalonians. This is unlikely because both Silas and Timothy were still with Paul.</p></li><li><p>Some scholars think Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians earlier than 1&nbsp;Thessalonians. But <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:15\">2 Thessalonians 2:15 </a>mentions a letter that was already sent to Thessalonica. The early Church from the second century would have called this 2&nbsp;Thessalonians.</p></li><li><p>Some scholars think Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians to Jewish Christians in Thessalonica and 1&nbsp;Thessalonians to non-Jewish (gentile) Christians. But this is most unlikely because the apostle cared about the unity of all Christians in one place (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:1-1Cor3:23\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1–3</a>). He cared very much about the unity of Jewish and non-Jewish Christians (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:22\">Ephesians 2:11–22</a>). </p></li><li><p>Some scholars think Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians to Christians in a different place (perhaps Berea or Philippi) and later the Christians in Thessalonica received it. However, there is no evidence that Paul sent this letter anywhere except to Thessalonica.</p></li></ol><p>When Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians, he was working with the same friends who helped him write 1 Thessalonians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:1\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:1</a>). This tells us that Paul probably wrote 2 Thessalonians not long after writing 1 Thessalonians. He wrote this letter because he heard about new problems the Christians in Thessalonica were experiencing, and he wanted to help them.</p><h2>Why Was the Second Letter to the Thessalonians Written?</h2><p>The apostle Paul had three main concerns when he wrote this letterr:</p><ol><li><p>As in all his letters, Paul wanted to encourage the believers to “<span>stand firm and cling to the traditions we taught you</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:15\">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>). He was thankful to God because he saw how their faith was growing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3\">1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13\">2:13</a>). The Thessalonian believers showed their faith through their love for each other and by staying faithful even when people were treating them badly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:4\">1:4</a>). Paul told them that God would make everything right when he judges the world. Their job was to live in a way that brought honor to Jesus. Then, when Jesus returns, he will be honored through the lives of his faithful people (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:5-2Thess1:12\">5–12</a>).</p></li><li><p>Paul needed to correct some wrong teaching. Some people were saying that the Day of the Lord (the time when Jesus will return) had already happened. They even claimed Paul had taught this (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2\">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). Paul explained that certain things needed to happen before Jesus returns. He said that evil would become very strong through someone called “the man of lawlessness” or “the son of destruction.” This person will:</p><ul><li><p>reject true worship of God, </p></li><li><p>show amazing signs and miracles to trick people, and </p></li><li><p>claim to be God. </p></li></ul><p>At the present time, there is a power that restrains him. </p><p>Paul explained that something was holding this evil back for now. But at the right time, this evil person will appear. Then Jesus will return and defeat this enemy completely (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1-2Thess2:12\">2 Thessalonians 2:1–12</a>). This teaching is similar to what Jesus said in the Gospels about false messiahs (the Antichrist or antichrists) who would try to trick people with miracles (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:5,Matt24:23-Matt24:26\">Matthew 24:5, 23–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:5-Mark13:6,Mark13:20-Mark13:23\">Mark 13:5–6, 20–23</a>). </p><p>In 1&nbsp;Thessalonians, Paul had emphasized that no one knows when Jesus will return, so believers should always be ready. In 2 Thessalonians, Paul explained what must happen before Jesus returns. Jesus himself taught both of these ideas when he talked about the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:51\">Matthew 24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:1-Mark13:37\">Mark 13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:1-Luke21:38\">Luke 21</a>).</p></li><li><p>Paul needed to address a problem in the church: some people had stopped working. He had mentioned this issue in his first letter to the Thessalonians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:11\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:14\">5:14</a>). , but now it had become worse. Paul reminded them that when he and his friends were in Thessalonica, they worked to earn money for their food instead of depending on the people they were teaching about Jesus. Paul gave them a clear rule: “<span>If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:10\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:10</a>).</p></li></ol><h2>What Is the Message of the Second Letter to the Thessalonians?</h2><h3>Thanksgiving for Their Christian Lives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:4\">1:3–4</a>)</h3><p>Paul thanked God because he saw how the Thessalonian believers were growing stronger in their faith. They were showing more love to each other and staying faithful even when people were making them suffer.</p><h3>God&apos;s Future Judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:5-2Thess1:10\">1:5–10</a>)</h3><p>The Christians in Thessalonica were suffering at this time. Paul explained that God would judge fairly in the future. When Jesus returns “with His mighty angels,” he will punish those who reject God and refuse his message of salvation offered in the gospel. These people will “<span>suffer the penalty of eternal destruction</span>.” But God&apos;s people will see Jesus&apos;s glory when he returns, and this will show that their faith and suffering was not meaningless.</p><h3>Prayer For the Glory of Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:11-2Thess1:12\">1:11–12</a>)</h3><p>Paul prayed that the Thessalonian Christians would live in a way that matched their calling as believers. He asked God to help them do the good things they wanted to do. Through God&apos;s kindness, Paul hoped that Jesus would be glorified (or honored) through their lives.</p><h3>Events Before the Second Coming (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1-2Thess2:12\">2:1–12</a>)</h3><p>In this section, Paul deals with the false teaching that the Day of the Lord (also called the Second Coming) had already happened. Before this event, “the man of lawlessness” must be revealed. Another name for this person is “the Antichrist.” The New Testament also speaks of “antichrists” and “the spirit of antichrist” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:18\">1&nbsp;John 2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John4:3\">4:3</a>). Paul said, “<span>it [the Day of the Lord] will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness—the son of destruction—is revealed</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3\">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3</a>).</p><p>Right now, something is holding back “the mystery of lawlessness” in the world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:6-2Thess2:7\">2 Thessalonians 2:6–7</a>). But in the future, just before Jesus returns, this restraint will be removed and evil will become very strong. This evil person will use fake miracles and wonders to trick many people (verse <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:9\">9</a>). When Jesus returns, he will defeat this evil and judge those who loved doing wrong instead of following the truth.</p><h3>Thanksgiving, Encouragement, and Prayer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13-2Thess3:5\">2:13–3:5</a>)</h3><p>After explaining about evil&apos;s power, Paul thanked God for how the Holy Spirit was working in the Thessalonian believers&apos; lives. He encouraged them to keep following what he had taught them, both in person and through his letters. Paul prayed that God, who gives comfort and hope, would make them strong in doing and saying good things.</p><p>Paul also asked for their prayers. He wanted God to help his message spread and protect him from evil people. He reminded the believers that God is faithful. Paul prayed that as they continued following his teachings, God would guide them to understand his love better and help them endure like Jesus did.</p><h3>Warning Against Idleness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:6-2Thess3:15\">3:6–15</a>)</h3><p>Paul wrote strongly against believers being lazy. He had taught this before and had shown it by his own example. Christians should “<span>begin working quietly</span>,” “to earn their own living,” and “<span>not grow weary in well-doing</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:12-2Thess3:13\">2 Thessalonians 3:12–13</a>). He told them not to spend time with people who refused to follow this teaching. However, they should correct these people as fellow believers (&quot;brothers&quot;), not treat them as enemies.</p><h3>Conclusion (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:16-2Thess3:18\">3:16–18</a>)</h3><p>Paul ends 2 Thessalonians with a prayer for grace and peace. He wrote the final words himself with his own hand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:17\">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>). This probably means someone else probably wrote down the rest of the letter as Paul spoke it (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor16:21\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 16:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:18\">Colossians 4:18</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4308\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Eschatology</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6782\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Paul, The Apostle</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7370\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Second Coming of Christ</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Thessalonians, First Letter to the</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7986\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Thessalonica</span>.</p>",
