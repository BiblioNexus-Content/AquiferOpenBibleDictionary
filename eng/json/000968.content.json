    "content": "<h1>BILDAD</h1><p>One of three friends who came to comfort Job in his anguish, identified as a Shuhite (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job2:11\">Jb 2:11</a>). That term suggests that he was a descendant of Shuah, son of Abraham and his second wife Keturah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:2\">Gn 25:1â€“2</a>). Bildad spoke to Job on three occasions. In his first speech he asserted that God upholds the just and punishes the wicked (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job8:1-Job8:22\">Jb 8</a>). Job must therefore be a hypocrite to say that he is right with God. In his second speech Bildad emphasized the immediate punishment of the wicked in this life (ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job18:1-Job18:21\">18</a>). Job must therefore be wicked because of his intense suffering. In his third speech Bildad proclaimed the majesty of God and called man a worm by comparison (ch <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job25:1-Job25:6\">25</a>). He implied that Job was foolish to claim to be righteous before such a holy God.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5562\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Job, Book of</span>.</p>",
