    "content": "<h1>SECOND JEWISH REVOLT</h1><p>A Jewish rebellion named after its leader, Bar-Kokhba. It lasted from AD 131 to 135. There were two reasons for the revolt:</p><ol><li><p>The emperor Hadrian made circumcision a crime punishable by death. </p></li><li><p>He decided to rebuild Jerusalem and erect a shrine to Zeus on the ruins of the temple site. This enraged the Jewish people.</p></li></ol><p>Bar-Kokhba&apos;s name means “son of a star.” He was believed to be the “<span>star [that] will come forth from Jacob</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num24:17\">Numbers 24:17</a>). Many Jews proclaimed Bar-Kokhba the Messiah (a savior or chosen leader that many Jews were waiting for). Bar-Kokhba used surprise attacks to fight the Romans. This kind of fighting led to huge losses for both Jews and Romans. A Roman general named Julius Severus finally defeated the Jewish resistance.</p><p>Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem and renamed it Aelia Capitolina. He resettled it with gentiles and forbade Jews from entering it or they would be killed.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3176\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bar-Kochba, Bar-Kokba</span>.</p>",
