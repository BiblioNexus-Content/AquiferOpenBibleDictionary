Eighth of the 12 sons of Ishmael, and thus a grandson of Abraham (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:15\">Gn 25:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:30\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:30</a>). The kjv reads “Hadar” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen25:15\">Genesis 25:15</a> and “Hadad” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 1:30</a>, whereas rsv and nlt read “Hadad” in both passages.</p><p>2. Edomite ruler, son of Bedad, who reigned before the Hebrew captivity in Egypt and who won an important victory over the Midianites in the plain of Moab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:35-Gen36:36\">Gn 36:35–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:46-1Chr1:47\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:46–47</a>).</p><p>3. Another king of Edom, one of the few whose wife, Mehetabel, was mentioned by name. His capital city was Pau (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen36:39\">Gn 36:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr1:50-1Chr1:51\">1&nbsp;Chr 1:50–51</a>).</p><p>4. Prince of the royal house of Edom who fled to Egypt after David and Joab conquered Edom and occupied the land. He grew up in Egypt and gained favor with the pharaoh, who gave him his sister-in-law as a wife. Later, when David was dead, he desired to return to Edom and lead a revolt against Solomon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:14-1Kgs11:25\">1&nbsp;Kgs 11:14–25</a>). Some scholars have identified him with #3 above.</p>",
