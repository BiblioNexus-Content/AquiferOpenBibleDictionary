Achor was in the north of Judah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:7\">Joshua 15:7</a>). Later, the valley is mentioned in prophecies of Israel’s future blessings. A valley once known for Israel’s trouble would become “a gateway of hope,” and a place for joyful singing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos2:15\">Hosea 2:15</a>). A place of barrenness would become a place for herds to lie down (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:10\">Isaiah 65:10</a>). The valley of Achor is identified as the Buqei‘ah.</p>",
