His administrative district was found in the area around Naphath-dor, a city on the coast south of Mount Carmel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:11\">1&nbsp;Kings 4:11</a>). The name means “son of Abinadab” and probably means that Ben-abinadab was the son of Solomon’s uncle Abinadab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:8\">1&nbsp;Samuel 16:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:13</a>).</p>",
