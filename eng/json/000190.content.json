When David asked for food, all he had was the holy bread from the tabernacle (Jesus spoke about this in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8\">Matthew 12:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8\">8</a>). Doeg the Edomite told Saul what he saw, who ordered Ahimelech to be killed. But Saul’s guards did not want to kill a priest. Doeg killed Ahimelech and 84 other priests, along with their families and animals (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:19\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:9</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:19\">19</a>). Only Abiathar, Ahimelech’s son, escaped and went to David for protection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:20-1Sam22:23\">1 Samuel 22:20</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:20-1Sam22:23\">23</a>). David wrote <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps52:1-Ps52:9\">Psalm 52</a> about what Doeg had done.</p></li><li><p>A Hittite who joined David’s fighting men during his escape from Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6\">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:6</a>).</p></li><li><p>The son of Abiathar and grandson of his father, Ahimelech. He helped his father in the priesthood under King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3,1Chr24:5,1Chr24:31\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:3, 5, 31</a>; compare with <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:16</a>, where some translations call him Abimelech).</p></li></ol>",
