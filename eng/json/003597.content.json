    "content": "<h1>MAGISTRATE</h1><p>The title of a public official who acted as judge and administrator of a given district. King Artaxerxes ordered Ezra to select magistrates along with judges to govern the people when they returned to Palestine (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra7:25\">Ezra 7:25</a>). This official was one of the officers of Nebuchadnezzar’s court invited to the dedication feast (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3\">Daniel 3:2</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3\">3</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:58\">Luke 12:58</a> portrayed the magistrate as a ruling authority whose verdict was final.</p><p>During the Roman era, each colony had two magistrates (called <em>duumviri</em>). They judged crimes against the state. So, Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates at Philippi. They were accused of advocating customs unacceptable to the Romans  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38\">Acts 16:20</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38\">38</a>). Before this <em>duumvir,</em> they were ordered to be stripped, beaten, and thrown into prison. A chief magistrate was sometimes called a &quot;praetor&quot; (<em>strategos</em> in the Greek). It was a special title for a lead <em>duumvir</em>.</p>",
