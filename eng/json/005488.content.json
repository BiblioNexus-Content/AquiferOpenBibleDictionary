    "content": "<h1>TASKMASTER</h1><p>A taskmaster was a person who supervised workers and forced them to work hard. Egyptian stone carvings show taskmasters holding whips, which they used to punish workers who did not work fast enough (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:11\">Exodus 1:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:7\">3:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:6-Exod5:14\">5:6–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job3:18\">Job 3:18</a>). The Hebrew word used for taskmaster in the Bible means &quot;to oppress,&quot; showing how badly they treated their workers. Kings David and Solomon had taskmasters. A man named Adoram was in charge of forced labor during their time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam20:24\">2&nbsp;Samuel 20:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:6\">1&nbsp;Kings 4:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:18\">12:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr10:18\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 10:18</a>). The cruel treatment by these taskmasters became one of the reasons why the northern tribes of Israel separated from the southern tribes after Solomon died (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:3-1Kgs12:14\">1&nbsp;Kings 12:3–14</a>).</p>",
