    "content": "<h1>ABISHAI</h1><p>King David’s nephew. The son of David&apos;s sister Zeruiah (his father is not mentioned) and brother of Joab and Asahel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:16</a>). </p><p>Abishai went with David to Saul’s camp one night and wanted to kill Saul while he was sleeping, but David stopped him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:12\">1&nbsp;Samuel 26:6</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:12\">12</a>). He also helped Joab kill Abner, Saul’s general, to avenge the death of their brother, Asahel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:30\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:30</a>). </p><p>Later, Abishai won a victory over the Edomites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:12</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13\">13</a>) and was second in command in a decisive battle against the Ammonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:10-1Chr19:15\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:10</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:10-1Chr19:15\">15</a>). Abishai was often cruel. For example, he wanted to behead Shimei for insulting David during Absalom’s rebellion, but again, David stopped him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 16:5</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:12\">12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21-2Sam19:23\">19:21</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21-2Sam19:23\">23</a>). When King David fled beyond the Jordan, Abishai led one of David’s three divisions that defeated Absalom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:15\">2&nbsp;Samuel 18:1</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:15\">15</a>).</p><p>Later, in a battle against the Philistines, Abishai saved David’s life by killing the giant Ishbi-benob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21:15</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17\">17</a>). He was called one of David’s bravest warriors (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18-2Sam23:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 23:18</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18-2Sam23:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:20</a><span>–</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21\">21</a>).</p>",
