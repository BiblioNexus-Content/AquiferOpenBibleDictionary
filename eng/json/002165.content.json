This courtyard was rectangular but not even on all sides, being wider at its northern end than its southern end. Both Jewish people and non-Jewish people (gentiles) could enter this area.</p><p>In this courtyard, merchants sold animals for temple sacrifices, and money changers helped visitors exchange their coins. There was a dividing wall with signs that warned gentiles not to enter the temple&apos;s inner areas. This is where Jesus drove out the merchants and money changers who were misusing the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:12-Matt21:13\">Matthew 21:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark11:15-Mark11:18\">Mark 11:15–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:14-John2:16\">John 2:14–16</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"7950\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Temple</span>.</p>",
