Calamus refers to either a plant or its aromatic root. It was one of the plants that grew in Solomon&apos;s garden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:14\">Song of Solomon 4:14</a>).</p><p>Two plants have been suggested as the source of biblical calamus: </p><ul><li><p>the sweet flag (<em>Acorus calamus</em>), and</p></li><li><p>the beardgrass (<em>Andropogon aromaticus</em>). </p></li></ul><p>The sweet flag has a strong pleasant smell and grows in Europe and Asia, but it is not found in Israel and the surrounding areas. Beardgrass, which comes from India, releases a strong fragrance when crushed and is thought to be the calamus mentioned in the Bible. Beardgrass produces an oil called ginger-grass oil.</p>",
