During this festival, the Israelites sounded trumpets to call for a time of remembrance, reflection, and preparation for the upcoming Day of Atonement. The festival was a time to remember God’s covenant with them, particularly the agreement made at Mount Sinai (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev23:23-Lev23:25\">Leviticus 23:23–25</a>). </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4416\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Feasts and Festivals of Israel</span>.</p>",
