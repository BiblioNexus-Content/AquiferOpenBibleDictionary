    "content": "<h1>REVELATION</h1><p>Revelation is when something hidden becomes known or is shown to others. </p><h2>What Does &quot;Revelation&quot; Mean?</h2><p>The word comes from the Latin word <em>revelatio.</em> It has two main meanings:</p><ol><li><p>The act of revealing to make something known.</p></li><li><p>The thing that is revealed. </p></li></ol><p>In theology, revelation refers to how God makes himself known to people. This can happen in two ways:</p><ul><li><p>God showing himself directly</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s message being shared through speaking or writing</p></li></ul><p>In the New Testament, the Greek word for revelation (<em>apokalupsis</em>) means &quot;to uncover&quot; or &quot;to make known.&quot; Another Greek word, <em>phanerosis</em>, means almost the same thing but emphasizes that something is shown clearly and is easy to understand.</p><h2>Different Views About How We Learn About God</h2><p>Rationalistic philosophy, as taught by thinkers like René Descartes and Immanuel Kant, believes that human reason is the only true source of knowledge about God. This view accepts only natural religion—beliefs that come from human reason—and denies any real supernatural revelation from God. Rationalists may sometimes consider the idea of a supernatural religion, but they do not believe that God can intervene directly in the world.</p><p>Christian theology teaches that the source of true knowledge is the word of God, specifically the Scriptures. However, modern critical theology, sometimes called &quot;scientific theology,&quot; has questioned whether Scripture can truly be trusted as a solid base for understanding God. Many scholars now argue that natural science gives more reliable knowledge and that supernatural events are unlikely. As a result, Scripture is no longer seen as the final authority. </p><p>According to this view, the Bible does not record what actually happened or what God truly said or did. Instead, it reflects the beliefs of the early church about what they thought happened. Therefore, the Bible is seen not as a divine message from God but as a unique product of early religious ideas and experiences.</p><p>Christian theology teaches that divine revelation—God’s message to humanity—is the only true source for understanding God. People know about God because God chooses to reveal himself. God acts first and is the author of revelation, while people receive it. Through this revelation, God shows things that would otherwise stay hidden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:29\">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:12\">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph3:3\">Ephesians 3:3</a>).</p><h2>General Revelation</h2><p>God reveals himself to humanity in two main ways. First, there is what is known as “general revelation.” Through general revelation, God makes himself known in nature, in history, and in people, who are made in his image. This idea—that people have an inner sense of God’s existence through the natural world—is found throughout the Bible, both in the Old Testament (like in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps10:11\">Psalms 10:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps14:1,Ps14:19\">14:1, 19:1</a>) and in the New Testament (such as <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts14:17\">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:22-Acts17:29\">17:22–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:19-Rom1:21\">Romans 1:19–21</a>). </p><p>People can recognize that God exists, that he is the Creator with great power, and that he rules with justice. For this reason, even when people deny God’s existence, as atheists do, they are fighting against an inner awareness of him. When Paul spoke to the Athenians, he reminded them that it is in God—the one true God—that all people live, move, and exist (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts17:28\">Acts 17:28</a>). However, knowing God through nature is not the end of revelation. Complete revelation happens when people encounter God personally.</p><h2>Special Revelation</h2><p>Knowing God through nature alone does not reveal his loving purpose to save all people. God’s heart is gracious and desires salvation for everyone. This is why God chose to reveal himself in a special way, so people could know his plans. Without this special revelation, people would not understand God’s plan for salvation through Christ. In the Bible, God guided prophets and apostles, filling their hearts and minds so they could speak his message (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer1:4-Jer1:19\">Jeremiah 1:4–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor2:13\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess2:13\">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet1:16-2Pet1:21\">2&nbsp;Peter 1:16–21</a>). </p><p>The highest point of God’s revelation was when his Son, Jesus Christ, came in human form (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14-John1:18\">John 1:14–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:5\">Galatians 4:4–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:2\">Hebrews 1:1–2</a>). Jesus revealed God the Father directly and fully, showing God’s loving will for all people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:31\">John 14</a>).</p><p>God did not just guide the hearts and minds of his prophets and apostles to speak his word; he also inspired them to write down the messages, promises, and teachings he wanted preserved forever. These sacred writings, gathered together in the Bible, form a unified whole that reveals God’s thoughts and plans for humanity. Through Scripture, the prophets and apostles shared not only historical events but also specific truths God wanted people to know. The main purpose of the Bible is to reveal Christ, and all of Scripture points to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:39\">John 5:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:35\">10:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts10:43\">Acts 10:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts18:28\">18:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:3</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3393\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Bible, Inspiration of the</span>.</p>",
