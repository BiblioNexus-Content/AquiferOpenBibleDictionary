It is first mentioned in connection with the “cutting off” of the waters of the Jordan that occurred at Adam, “the city that is beside Zarethan” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:16\">Jos 3:16</a>). Its location is more precisely defined in the list of Solomon’s administrative districts as being in the vicinity of Beth-shan below Jezreel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:12\">1&nbsp;Kgs 4:12</a>). Bronze utensils for Solomon’s temple were cast near there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:46\">7:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr4:17\">2&nbsp;Chr 4:17</a>, “Zeredah”).</p>",
