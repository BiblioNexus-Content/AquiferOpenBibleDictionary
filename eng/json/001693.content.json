City of residence for Og, king of Bashan (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut1:4\">Dt 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:10\">3:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:4\">Jos 12:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:12\">13:12</a>). It was located on the southern branch of the Harmuk River, which was the southern border of Bashan. At this strategic point Og could look over the neighboring region for invaders from the south or from the east, where the land turned into a desert. At Edrei, Moses was able to defeat Og before destroying the city (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:33-Num21:35\">Nm 21:33–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:1-Deut3:6\">Dt 3:1–6</a>). The territory was allotted to the Machirites, the eastern clan of the tribe of Manasseh (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:31\">Jos 13:31</a>). The modern site for Edrei seems to be Derba, a town of 5,000 in Syria. Many important remains from antiquity survive in this town, including shops, cisterns, streets, and underground caves.</p><p>2. Fortified city allotted to Naphtali (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:37\">Jos 19:37</a>). It was near Kedesh, and may possibly be identified with the modern Tell Khureibeh.</p>",
