The prophet Isaiah used the name in a &quot;woe&quot; oracle warning people to turn from their wrongdoing (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa29:1-Isa29:2,Isa29:7\">Isaiah 29:1â€“2, 7</a>). </p><p>In the oracle, Isaiah called Jerusalem &quot;Ariel&quot; (which means &quot;hearth of God&quot;). Naming one part of a whole thing for dramatic effect is a poetic device called a &quot;synecdoche.&quot; Jerusalem is the location of the altar of burnt offering, but Isaiah refers to the entire city as an altar.</p><p>In a dramatic play on words, Isaiah pronounced a judgment of God on Jerusalem. The city of the hearth of God would face destruction from enemies and become an ariel, a pagan altar hearth.</p>",
