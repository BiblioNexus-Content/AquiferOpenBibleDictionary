    "content": "<h1>DEW</h1><p>Dew is the water that forms on surfaces during the night when warm air cools down. You can usually see dew as small drops of water on plants and other surfaces in the early morning. <br><br>In the ancient Near East, dew was very important. It provided much-needed water in hot, dry areas where rain was rare. Plants needed dew to grow, and farmers depended on it for good harvests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:10\">Haggai 1:10</a>). The Bible often mentions dew and rain together as valuable gifts from God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1\">1&nbsp;Kings 17:1</a>). Dew played an important role during the exodus (when God led the Israelites out of Egypt). It helped provide food for the people in the desert (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:13-Exod16:21\">Exodus 16:13–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:9\">Numbers 11:9</a>). </p><p>The Bible uses &quot;dew&quot; as a picture of several different things:</p><ul><li><p>Dew is sometimes a symbol of blessing. For example, Isaac blessed Jacob by asking that &quot;the dew of heaven&quot; be given to him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:28\">Genesis 27:28</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut33:13\">Deuteronomy 33:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic5:7\">Micah 5:7</a>). </p></li><li><p>Dew was also a symbol of refreshment, renewal, or prosperity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job29:19\">Job 29:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos14:5\">Hosea 14:5</a>). </p></li><li><p>A king’s favor was said to be like dew upon the grass (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov19:12\">Proverbs 19:12</a>). </p></li><li><p>Dew could represent something that comes quietly. Because dew forms silently at night, it was used to describe quiet, secret actions(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam17:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 17:12</a>). </p></li><li><p>Dew is also a symbol of something that disappears quickly. Since dew evaporates fast in the morning sun, it was used to describe things that don&apos;t last long (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos6:4\">Hosea 6:4</a>). </p></li></ul><p>In one of David&apos;s psalms, he wrote that God would give new strength like the morning dew (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:3\">Psalm 110:3</a>).</p>",
