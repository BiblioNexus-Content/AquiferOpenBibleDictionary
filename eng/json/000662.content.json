The name may suggest that the Canaanite goddess Baalath, patron of Byblos, was connected with the place or well in some way. Baalath-beer was the name of a town in the tribe of Simeon. The name is also given as: </p><ul><li><p>Baal or Baalath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:33\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:33</a>)</p></li><li><p>Ramah of the Negev (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh19:8\">Joshua 19:8</a>)</p></li><li><p>Ramoth of the Negev (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:27\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:27</a>) </p></li></ul><p>It may have been on the southern border of Simeon’s tribal land.</p>",
