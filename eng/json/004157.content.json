    "content": "<h1>NOB</h1><p>A city located on the eastern slopes of Mount Scopus opposite the Mount of Olives and northeast of Jerusalem. An important religious center, 86 priests lived in Nob along with the ephod (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:13-1Sam22:20\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:13–20</a>). When the Philistines destroyed the sanctuary in Shiloh, Nob became the central sanctuary for the priests who fled Shiloh.</p><p>The events of David&apos;s visit to Nob bear witness to the ancient customs of the details of the table and the bread of the presence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod37:10-Exod37:16\">Exodus 37:10–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:2-1Sam21:7\">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:2–7</a>). Jesus cites David’s hunger as a good reason for breaking the Sabbath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark2:23-Mark2:28\">Mark 2:23–28</a>). David, fleeing from Saul and needing food, went into the sanctuary at Nob and took the loaves laid out each Sabbath as an offering to the Lord.</p><p>Ahimelech was a descendant of Eli and leader of the priests of Nob. He gave the showbread to David, along with the sword that had killed Goliath. This made Saul angry enough to order the murder of Ahimelech and the massacre of all the priests and citizens of Nob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:6-1Sam22:23\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:6–23</a>). This event led to the king&apos;s downfall. </p><p>Abiathar, a priest who evaded the massacre, played a prominent role in the reign of David until Solomon eventually removed him from his position (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:26–27</a>). The phrase &quot;where God was worshiped&quot; may refer to the sanctuary at Nob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam15:32\">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:32</a>).</p>",
