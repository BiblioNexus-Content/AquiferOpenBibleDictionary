    "content": "<h1>GOIIM</h1><p>1. People or region mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:1,Gen14:9\">Genesis 14:1, 9</a> as ruled by a king named Tidal. The word is variously translated “nations” (kjv) and “Goiim” (rsv, nlt). Tidal, together with three other kings—Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, and Kedorlaomer of Elam—attacked several cities in the valley of Siddim near the Dead Sea (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:3\">Gn 14:3</a>). They defeated the five kings of the valley region, looted their towns, and captured Lot, Abraham’s nephew, who lived in Sodom (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:12\">12</a>). When Abraham heard of this, he gathered his soldiers, pursued the victorious kings, defeated them, and rescued Lot (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:13-Gen14:16\">13–16</a>).</p><p>2. People mentioned in connection with Joshua’s victory over an unknown king of Goiim (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:23\">Jos 12:23</a>). The location of these people is uncertain, since the verse reads “Gilgal” in the Hebrew text and “Galilee” in the Septuagint.</p>",
