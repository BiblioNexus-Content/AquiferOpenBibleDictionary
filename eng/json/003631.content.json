    "content": "<h1>MALACHI (Person)</h1><p>Author of the last book of the OT (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:1\">Mal 1:1</a>). The prophet Malachi lived about 500–460 BC. His name means “my angel” or “my messenger” and is so translated in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:1\">Malachi 3:1</a> and elsewhere. Apart from the book that bears his name, nothing else is known about him from the Bible. In the apocryphal book of <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Esd1:40\">2&nbsp;Esdras 1:40</a> he is identified as “Malachi, who is also called a messenger of the Lord.” Rabbinic tradition suggests that Malachi may be another name for Ezra the scribe, although there is no supporting evidence for this identification.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6058\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Malachi, Book of</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6999\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Prophet, Prophetess</span>.</p>",
