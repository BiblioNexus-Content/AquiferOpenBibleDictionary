    "content": "<h1>ANCHOR</h1><p>An object used to keep a ship or boat in one place in the water. An anchor is attached to a ship by a cable or chain. When it is thrown overboard, its weight and ability to dig into the sea bottom keep the boat from drifting. </p><p>Anchors were used many centuries before the time of Christ. They began as simple stone weights. They developed into wooden hooks weighted with lead or stone. </p><p>Not long after the time of Christ, iron anchors of the familiar modern shape were used. Anchors are mentioned in Luke’s account of the apostle Paul’s voyage to Rome (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:13\">Acts 27:13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:29-Acts27:30\">29–30</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:40\">40</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:19\">Hebrews 6:19</a> uses “anchor” as a symbol to indicate the stability of God’s promise of salvation to those who believe in him.</p>",
