The residents were threatened by non-Jewish forces of Ptolemais, Tyre, and Sidon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:15\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:15</a>). They sent for help by letter from Judas Maccabeus, and Judas sent his brother Simon with 3,000 men. They rescued the Galileans and &quot;led them into Judea with great rejoicing&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Macc5:23\">1&nbsp;Maccabees 5:23</a>).</p>",
