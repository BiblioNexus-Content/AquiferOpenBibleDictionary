    "content": "<h1>RABBI</h1><p>A title of respect meaning &quot;my great one&quot; or &quot;my superior one.&quot; Jewish people used this title for their religious teachers in Jesus&apos;s time. </p><p>According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:7\">Matthew 23:7</a>, &quot;rabbi&quot; was used as a title to address the Jewish scribes and Pharisees. However, in the New Testament, it is most commonly used as a title of respectful address when others were speaking to Jesus. In many stories in the Gospels, people called Jesus &quot;Rabbi.&quot; For example:</p><ul><li><p>Nathanael in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:49\">John 1:49</a></p></li><li><p>Peter and Andrew in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:38\">John 1:38</a></p></li><li><p>Nicodemus in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:2\">John 3:2</a></p></li><li><p>The disciples (as a group) in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:2\">John 9:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:8\">11:8</a></p></li><li><p>A general crowd in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:25\">John 6:25</a></p></li></ul><p>Mary Magdalene and blind Bartimaeus both use the longer form, &quot;rabboni,&quot; to address Jesus directly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:51\">Mark 10:51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:16\">John 20:16</a>). This shows even more profound respect than the use of the shorter title &quot;rabbi.&quot; By the time John’s Gospel was written, the title &quot;rabbi&quot; meant &quot;teacher.&quot; John explicitly states this in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:38\">1:38</a> and implies it in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:2\">3:2</a>.</p><p>Jesus condemns the scribes and the Pharisees for the pride they took in the title, insisting people call them &quot;rabbi&quot; in public places (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:7-Matt23:8\">Matthew 23:7–8</a>). Jesus prohibited the use of the title for his own disciples, saying, &quot;You are not to be called rabbi.&quot; Jesus did not prohibit the legitimate possession of the title but rejected pridefully seeking the honor associated with it. When people did use the title of Jesus in a reverent way, they were not rebuked.</p>",
