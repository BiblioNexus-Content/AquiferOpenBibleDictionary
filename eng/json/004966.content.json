    "content": "<h1>SEPHARVAIM, SEPHARVITES*</h1><p>One of five cities and its inhabitants who were transported to Samaria after the fall of Israel to Sargon II, king of Assyria, in 722 BC (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:24\">2&nbsp;Kgs 17:24</a>). The Sepharvites were remembered for their abominable practice of offering their children as burnt sacrifices to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech. In a taunting message to King Hezekiah of Judah (715–686 BC), King Sennacherib of Assyria (705–681 BC) warned that as the gods and kings of Sepharvaim were not able to prevent her fall to the Assyrians, so too it would be with Jerusalem and Hezekiah’s God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:34\">2&nbsp;Kgs 18:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa36:19\">Is 36:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa37:13\">37:13</a>). The location of Sepharvaim is uncertain. It is probably identifiable with the Syrian city of Sibraim near Damascus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek47:16\">Ez 47:16</a>).</p>",
