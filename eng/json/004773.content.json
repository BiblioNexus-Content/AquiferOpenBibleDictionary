    "content": "<h1>RIGHT HAND</h1><p>In the Bible, the phrase &quot;right hand&quot; has two main meanings. First, it means the right side of a person&apos;s body. Second, it is often used as a symbol with special meaning.</p><p>The word &quot;right&quot; in the Bible often means &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; When something is &quot;right,&quot; it means it is just and follows God&apos;s ways (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:25\">Genesis 18:25</a>). In many places in the Bible, God&apos;s right hand is used as a symbol of his power. For example:</p><ul><li><p>It represents how God helps his people win battles(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps17:7,Ps17:98\">Psalms 17:7, 98:1</a>)</p></li><li><p>It shows how God punishes those who do evil things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:16\">Hebrews 2:16</a>) </p></li><li><p>It shows how God punishes those who do evil things (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps139:10\">Psalms 139:10</a>). </p></li></ul><p>While humans cannot save themselves by their own power, God promises to make people strong when he decides to help them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:14\">Job 40:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa41:13\">Isaiah 41:13</a>).</p><p>To be at the right hand of God is to be in a place of great blessings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps16:11\">Psalms 16:11</a>). At the right hand of God, the Lord Jesus Christ now reigns in glory and intercedes for those he has redeemed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:34\">Romans 8:34</a>).</p><p>To offer the right hand of fellowship is to extend acceptance and grace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:9\">Galatians 2:9</a>). In Bible times, people would shake right hands to show they were making a serious promise or agreement. This practice of using the right hand to make promises was also used in biblical times and continues today (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:15\">2&nbsp;Kings 10:15</a>).</p><p>The left hand is sometimes linked to blessings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov3:16\">Proverbs 3:16</a>). However, it may also be linked to when someone betrays trust or does something wrong (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl10:2\">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a>).</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"4812\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Hand</span>.</p>",
