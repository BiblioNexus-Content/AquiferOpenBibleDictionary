In the story, Asmodeus killed the first seven husbands of Sarah, the only daughter of Raguel from Ecbatana, on their wedding nights. Sarah was very sad until Tobit&apos;s son Tobias married her.</p><p>The angel Raphael told Tobias how to defeat Asmodeus. Tobias burned the heart and liver of a fish in a ritual. This defeated Asmodeus.</p><p>In Hebrew stories about spirits, people often thought of Asmodeus as the king or leader of evil spirits. He might be connected to a Persian spirit called “Aeshma-daeva.” This spirit was known for causing storms, anger, and strong sexual desire.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8048\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Tobit, Book of</span>.</p>",
