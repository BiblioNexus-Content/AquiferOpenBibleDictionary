The chief priests purchased the field as a burial ground for strangers (formerly, it was named the potter’s field). Judas hanged himself, and his intestines spilled out there. This account uses the Aramaic expression <em>Akeldama</em> (in the King James Version it is “Aceldama”), translated “field of blood.” The Akeldama is on the southern slope of the valley of Hinnom near the Kidron Valley.</p>",
