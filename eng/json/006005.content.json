    "content": "<h1>ZOBAH</h1><p>Zobah was an Aramean nation that was defeated by Israel during the early kingdom period. King Saul won battles against the kings of Zobah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47\">1&nbsp;Samuel 14:47</a>). </p><p>Soon after David became king of Israel, he defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam8:3-2Sam8:5,2Sam8:12\">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:3–5, 12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr18:3-1Chr18:10\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 18:3–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps60:1\">Psalm 60 title</a>). Later, the Ammonites hired 20,000 <span>Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zobah</span> for an anticipated attack by the military forces of David. Joab led Israel’s army and defeated the combined forces of the Ammonites and their hired Aramean allies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6-2Sam10:14\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:6–14</a>). Afterward, Hadadezer sent reinforcements, but David himself led Israel to another victory over the Arameans (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam10:15-2Sam10:19\">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:15–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr19:16-1Chr19:19\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 19:16–19</a>).</p>",
