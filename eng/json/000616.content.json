    "content": "<h1>AVENGER OF BLOOD</h1><p>A person who chased and eventually executed the murderer of a close relative (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:1-Num35:34\">Numbers 35</a>). This “redeemer“ was expected to act in cases of intentional murder but not accidental manslaughter. Someone guilty of manslaughter could seek asylum in one of six designated cities (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:11\">Numbers 35:11</a>) to make sure that proper legal processes could take place. The role of the avenger of blood is mentioned in stories about:</p><ul><li><p>Gideon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21\">Judges 8:18</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21\">21</a>)</p></li><li><p>Joab (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27,2Sam3:30\">2&nbsp;Samuel 3:27, 30</a>)</p></li><li><p>The Gibeonites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:22\">2&nbsp;Samuel 21</a>)</p></li><li><p>Amaziah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6\">2&nbsp;Kings 14:5</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6\">6</a>) </p></li></ul><p>During the monarchy, the king could stop the avenger (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11\">2&nbsp;Samuel 14:8</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11\">–</a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11\">11</a>).</p><p>This custom was based on God&apos;s command that a life should be taken for a life in cases of intentional homicide (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:6\">Genesis 9:6</a>). Unfortunately, the goal of the law—to highlight the importance of human life—has sometimes been misunderstood, leading to blood feuds and the destruction of entire families in some societies.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3747\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Civil Law and Justice</span>.</p>",
