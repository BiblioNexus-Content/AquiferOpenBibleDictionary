Saltwort, soapwort, and glasswort were alkali-bearing plants indigenous to western Asia and known to the ancient Hebrews. Soap was used primarily for cleansing purposes. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer2:22\">Jeremiah 2:22</a> soap is used to clean the body, and in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:2\">Malachi 3:2</a>, to wash clothes.</p>",
