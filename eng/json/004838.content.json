Salecah (variously spelled Salcah and Salchah in the kjv) was located near the city of Edrei (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh12:5\">Jos 12:5</a>). The Israelites gained possession of this city when they defeated Og&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut3:10\">Dt 3:10</a>). Later, Salecah was included in the land received by Gadâ€™s tribe for an inheritance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:11\">Jos 13:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr5:11\">1&nbsp;Chr 5:11</a>). The city is identifiable with the modern town of Salkhad.</p>",
