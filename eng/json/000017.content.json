    "content": "<h1>ABEL (Person)</h1><p>The second male child of Adam and Eve (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:2\">Genesis 4:2</a>). His name probably comes from old Sumerian and Akkadian words that mean “son.” &quot;Abel&quot; was used as a general term for all humans.</p><p>Abel’s older brother, Cain, was a farmer, but Abel was a shepherd. When both brothers brought offerings, God accepted Abel’s animal sacrifice but rejected Cain’s vegetable offering. Because of this, Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him.</p><p>The Bible story suggests that Abel had better character, which is why God blessed his offering and not Cain&apos;s (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:7\">Genesis 4:7</a>). The Bible does not say that grain or vegetable offerings were worse than animal offerings for either sin or fellowship sacrifices. Mosaic law allows for either. In the New Testament, Abel is said to be the first person who died because of their faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:35\">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:51\">Luke 11:51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:4\">Hebrews 11:4</a>).</p>",
