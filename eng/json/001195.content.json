    "content": "<h1>CAUDA</h1><p>Cauda was a small island south of Crete. The ship carrying the apostle Paul to Rome stopped at Cauda during a storm to find temporary protection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:16\">Acts 27:16</a>). </p><p>Behind the island, the water was calmer. In this protected area, the sailors pulled on board a small boat they had been towing behind the ship. They also worked to strengthen the ship&apos;s hull.</p><p>Even after they lowered the sails, the strong winds pushed them past the island. Eventually, the ship was wrecked.</p><p>Cauda is the modern island of Gaudos (also called Gozzo). Ancient handwritten copies of the Bible spell the name in different ways. Some use &quot;Cauda&quot; (as in most modern Bible versions), while others use &quot;Clauda&quot; (as in the King James Version and New American Standard Bible).</p>",
