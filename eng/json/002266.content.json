Gourds belong to the same plant family as cucumbers, melons, and squash.</p><p>The Bible mentions gourds in two key passages:</p><ol><li><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah4:6-Jonah4:10\">Jonah 4:6–10</a>, God made a plant grow quickly to provide shade for Jonah. Some translations call it a &quot;gourd,&quot; but the original Hebrew word may refer to a castor oil plant (<em>Ricinus communis</em>) rather than a true gourd. The plant withered when God sent a worm to damage it, leaving Jonah exposed to the sun.</p></li><li><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:38-2Kgs4:41\">2 Kings 4:38–41</a>, during a famine, one of Elisha&apos;s followers gathered wild gourds to add to a stew. These were likely <em>Citrullus colocynthis</em>, a cucumber-like vine with a bitter, poisonous fruit. When they tasted the bitter stew, the people cried out, &quot;There is death in the pot!&quot; Elisha then performed a miracle, adding flour to the stew to make it safe to eat.</p></li></ol><p>Gourds have been cultivated for thousands of years. Some types are edible, while others are used to make containers, bowls, ladles, and water jugs when dried.</p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"209533\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Castor Oil Plant</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"209539\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Wild Gourd</span>.</p>",
