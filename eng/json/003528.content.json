    "content": "<h1>LOTUS BUSH, LOTUS TREE</h1><p>A lotus bush or tree (<em>Zizyphus lotus</em>) is a shrub or low tree that grows to a height of about 1.5 meters (5 feet). It has smooth, zigzag branches that are whitish in color. The &quot;lotus plants&quot; in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:21-Job40:22\">Job 40:21â€“22</a> may refer to the lotus bush. </p><p>Other scholars believe that the plants in Job refer to large-leafed trees such as the plane tree, <em>Platanus orientalis</em>, or the oleander, <em>Nerium oleander</em>. This idea is based on the belief that the animal described in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job40:1-Job40:24\">Job 40</a> is the hippopotamus. These scholars think it is unlikely that a hippopotamus would live under a lotus bush or even be found in places where this shrub grows. They consider the plane tree or the oleander to be more likely choices.</p>",
