    "content": "<h1>JUDGMENT, Hall of</h1><p>The King James Version translation of the New Testament word <em>praitorion</em> in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:28,John18:33\">John 18:28, 33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:9\">19:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:35\">Acts 23:35</a>. Some Bible versions translate this word as “Praetorium.“ Others translate it as “common hall.“</p><p>The&nbsp;word was first used for the place where the Roman general’s tent stood in an army camp. It was a reference to the main office of the camp. It then came to mean the military council that met in the general’s tent. Later, it was used for to the palace where the Roman governor or procurator lived while ruling a region. It also identified the army&apos;s main office and camp that housed the army in connection with the governor’s living place. </p><p>In Jerusalem, it was the palace that Herod the Great had built for himself. When the Roman governor came from his normal house in Caesarea to Jerusalem, he lived in Herod’s palace. He did his official business there. It was there that Pilate questioned Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:28\">John 18:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:9\">19:9</a>). It was at another place called the “Pavement” where Pilate sat in judgment and gave Jesus to the Jews.</p>",
