    "content": "<h1>QUEEN</h1><p>A word used to describe a reigning monarch, a queen consort, or a queen mother. </p><p>The queen of Sheba was the world&apos;s richest woman. She became so after visiting King Solomon&apos;s luxurious court (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:1\">1&nbsp;Kings 10:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt12:42\">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:31\">Luke 11:31</a>). She arrived with a large retinue and camels bearing gold, jewels, and spices. Candace, queen of Ethiopia, is mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:27\">Acts 8:27</a>. A eunuch, a senior minister in her court, was converted by Philip while visiting Jerusalem.</p><p>In Jewish history, Athaliah reigned for six years. She thought she had killed all rival claimants to the throne in the royal family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:3\">2&nbsp;Kings 11:3</a>). Also, Salome Alexandra succeeded her husband, Alexander Janneus, as ruler from 76 to 67 BC. A queen consort usually played a minor role. Two exceptions are Bathsheba (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:15-1Kgs1:31\">1&nbsp;Kings 1:15–31</a>) and Jezebel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29\">1 Kings 21:1–29</a>). Bathsheba wanted her son to succeed to the throne. Jezebel plotted a false accusation that led to Naboth&apos;s death. </p><p>The queen mother played a powerful role. She not only ruled over the royal household but also was held in respect both by the court and by the monarch (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod20:12\">Exodus 20:12</a>). Her requests were unlikely to be denied (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:20\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:20</a>). As the king&apos;s mother, she was unique. His wives shared their position with others. Maacah, queen mother of Abijam, even retained her authority during much of her grandson’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:2\">1&nbsp;Kings 15:2, 10, 13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr15:16\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 15:16</a>). The queen mother was crowned (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer13:18\">Jeremiah 13:18</a>). Bathsheba, now queen, was powerful enough to sit at King Solomon&apos;s right hand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:19\">1&nbsp;Kings 2:19</a>).</p>",
