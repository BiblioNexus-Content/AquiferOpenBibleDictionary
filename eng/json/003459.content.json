The place was evidently in the hills, and after Samson’s victory (using a jawbone of an ass for a weapon), it was called “the height of the jawbone” (“Jawbone Hill,” nlt), that is, Ramath-lehi (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:17\">17</a>). It was apparently near a spring in a crater or depression (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:19\">19</a>). An adjacent cliff was called Etam (v <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:11\">11</a>). Other than somewhere in the hills behind Beth-shemesh, there is no hint of where to locate (Ramath-) Lehi.</p>",
