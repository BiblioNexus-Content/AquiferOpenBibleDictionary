    "content": "<h1>BDELLIUM</h1><p>Bdellium is an aromatic gum resin that looks similar to myrrh. It comes from various trees of the <em>Commiphora</em> genus that grow in Africa and western Asia. Most scholars believe the bdellium mentioned in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:12\">Genesis 2:12</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:7\">Numbers 11:7</a> comes from the <em>Commiphora africana</em>, a shrub that grows naturally in southern Arabia and northeastern Africa. This yellowish, transparent, fragrant resin looks like a pearl.</p><p>The Bible describes the manna gathered by the Israelites as having the same color as bdellium (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:7\">Numbers 11:7</a>). Bdellium is also mentioned along with gold and onyx stone found near the garden of Eden (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:12\">Genesis 2:12</a>). Because it appeared in this list of valuable items, people once thought bdellium might be pearl or a precious stone.</p><p>The <em>Commiphora</em> genus includes the plants that produce myrrh and possibly what the Bible calls &quot;balm.&quot; Outside the Bible, an English plant expert described bdellium as an aromatic gum from a tree known in Persia and beyond. The Roman writer Pliny, who lived in the first century AD, also described bdellium as a waxy substance that resembled a pearl.</p><p>See also <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"3152\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Balm</span>; <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6421\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Myrrh</span>.</p>",
