    "content": "<h1>SWEET BAY TREE, BAY LAUREL</h1><p>A tree that naturally grows in Israel and the surrounding areas. It grows 12 to 18 meters (40 to 60 feet) high. It has fragrant, evergreen leaves.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps37:35\">Psalm 37:35</a>, the &quot;well-rooted native tree&quot; might refer to the cedar of Lebanon (<em>Cedrus libani</em>). But most scholars believe it refers to the sweet bay (<em>Laurus nobilis</em>), also called the bay laurel. This evergreen tree is native to the Mediterranean region and grows in thickets and woodlands, from coastal areas to mid-elevation mountain regions. While it grows abundantly in certain areas, such as Mount Carmel and near Hebron, it is not common throughout Israel and the surrounding areas.</p><p>People have used its leaves as a seasoning in cooking for centuries. Additionally, its fruit, leaves, and bark have been used in traditional medicine for many years.</p>",
