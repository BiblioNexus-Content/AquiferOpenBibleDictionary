It has sharp thorns and small flowers that look like pea flowers. In hot weather, the plant produces a sweet gum that comes out through the stems and leaves. This gum hardens in the sun and can be collected. In some regions, people call it “manna,” but it is different from the manna described in the Bible.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6093\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Manna</span>.</p>",
