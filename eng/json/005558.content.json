    "content": "<h1>THE WAY</h1><p>&quot;The Way&quot; is one of the names applied to the early Christian community (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:2\">Acts 9:2</a>). Both Jewish people and non-religious people used this name when talking about Christians. The name appeared in both positive and negative discussions about the church (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts19:9,Acts19:23\">19:9, 23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:4\">22:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:14,Acts24:22\">24:14, 22</a>). </p><p>The apostle Paul used the term in his defense before the Roman governor Felix. This suggests that the name had some kind of official acceptance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:14,Acts24:22\">24:14, 22</a>). Most likely, this name came from Jesus&apos;s own statement “I am the way and the truth and the life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:6\">John 14:6</a>).</p>",
