    "content": "<h1>JAZER</h1><p>Jazer was a town east of the Jordan River in the region of Gilead.</p><p>The Israelites took Jazer and its nearby villages when Moses was their leader (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num21:32\">Numbers 21:32</a>). The tribes of Gad and Reuben wanted to live there because the land was good for raising animals. They had many flocks and herds (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:5\">32:1–5</a>). They promised to build protection for their women and children. Then they would go with the other tribes to fight in Canaan (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num32:6-Num32:27\">6–27</a>). </p><p>Jazer marked part of the border of the land given to the tribe of Gad (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:25\">Joshua 13:25</a>). It was also given to the Levites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh21:39\">Joshua 21:39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:81\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:81</a>). Later, Joab came to Jazer when King David sent him to count the people of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam24:5\">2&nbsp;Samuel 24:5</a>). Jazer is also mentioned when David looked for “capable men” to serve (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr26:31\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 26:31</a>). </p><p>About 200 years later, the nation of Moab took control of Jazer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa16:6-Isa16:9\">Isaiah 16:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer48:32\">Jeremiah 48:32</a>).</p>",
