Zimri&apos;s sin was considered worse because he did it openly, he was a tribal leader, and the woman was the daughter of an important Midianite prince.</p></li><li><p>A king of Israel who ruled for only seven days (in 885 BC). He became king after he killed King Elah and all of Baasha&apos;s family (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:9-1Kgs16:12\">1&nbsp;Kings 16:9–12</a>). Zimri was the commander of half of the chariot forces, but he failed to get support from the people. Instead, the people supported Omri, who was the commander of the army. When Omri attacked Zimri at Tirzah, Zimri killed himself by setting fire to his palace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:15-1Kgs16:18\">16:15–18</a>). Later, Queen Jezebel referred to Zimri&apos;s cruelty when she accused Jehu of being like Zimri (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:31\">2&nbsp;Kings 9:31</a>).</p></li><li><p>One of the sons of Zerah. Zerach was a son of Judah by Tamar (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 2:6</a>). Another name for him is Zabdi in the parallel passage in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh7:1,Josh7:17\">Joshua 7:1, 17</a>. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"8284\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Zabdi #1</span>.</p></li><li><p>A descendant of King Saul from the tribe of Benjamin. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:36\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:36</a> lists him as the son of Jehoaddah and the father of Moza. This Zimri is likely the same as Zimri the son of Jadah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:42\">9:42</a>).</p></li></ol>",
