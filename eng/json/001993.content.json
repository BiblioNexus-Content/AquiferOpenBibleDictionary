    "content": "<h1>FELIX, Antonius</h1><p>Roman procurator (governor) of Judea (AD 52–60) succeeding Cumanus, appointed by Claudius and succeeded by Festus Porcius. Felix’s brother, Pallas, a prominent, more influential Roman, interceded on his behalf after he was recalled from his procuratorship by Nero. During his oppressive rule, Felix utilized the aid of robbers to have Jonathan, the high priest, murdered. His tyranny has been cited as the cause for the Jewish revolt that broke out six years after he was recalled. Felix had three wives: one unknown, another the granddaughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and another the Jewish sister of Agrippa II, whose name was Drusilla. At the age of 16 Drusilla left her husband, King Azizus of Emesa, to marry Felix. She later bore him a son, Agrippa.</p><p>Felix was serving as governor when the apostle Paul was brought before him in Caesarea to answer charges against him after the riot in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts23:24-Acts24:27\">Acts 23:24–24:27</a>). After a five-day delay, Tertullus, spokesman for the Jews, and others arrived to state their charges. Felix put off a decision until he could hear from Lysias, the tribune. In the meantime Paul was placed in limited custody. Felix hoped to obtain bribe money for his release. As a result, Paul was detained for two years, during which time he and Felix often conversed. The apostle’s message of “justice, self-control, and future judgment” alarmed Felix greatly (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts24:25\">24:25</a>). Record of his life after being recalled by Nero is not available.</p>",
