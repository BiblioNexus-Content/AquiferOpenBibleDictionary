Cozbi was in an improper relationship with Zimri, an Israelite man, during the incident at Baal-peor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num25:15\">Numbers 25:15</a>). Zur was later killed by the Israelites, along with four other Midianite kings and Balaam, as part of God&apos;s judgment on Midian (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num31:8\">31:8</a>). He seems to have been under the authority of Sihon, the Amorite king, since he is listed as one of Sihon&apos;s &quot;princes&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh13:21\">Joshua 13:21</a>).</p></li><li><p>A son of Jeiel, who established the town of Gibeon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr8:30\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 8:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:36\">9:36</a>). He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a distant relative of King Saul.</p></li></ol>",
