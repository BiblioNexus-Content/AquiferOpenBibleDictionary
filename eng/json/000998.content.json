    "content": "<h1>BLASTUS</h1><p>A royal secretary to King Herod Agrippa I (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:20\">Acts 12:20</a>). The people from the cities of Tyre and Sidon needed food from Herod&apos;s country, but Herod was angry with them. They first made friends with Blastus so he would help them get a meeting with the king. After Blastus arranged this meeting, Herod gave a speech to the delegates. During this speech, Herod accepted worship from the people instead of giving glory to God. Because of this, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a deadly illness (verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:21-Acts12:23\">21â€“23</a>).</p>",
