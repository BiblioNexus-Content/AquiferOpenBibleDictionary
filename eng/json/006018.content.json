Zuph was a member of the Kohathite branch of Levites and is listed as the son of Elkanah (different than above) and the father of Toah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:35\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:35</a>). He is the same as Zophai listed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:26\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:26</a>. It is evident that Zuph was a Levite, even though he is listed as an Ephraimite in the 1&nbsp;Samuel passage.</p>",
