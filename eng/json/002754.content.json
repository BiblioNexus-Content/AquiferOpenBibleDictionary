He became the ancestral head of a house of priests: Pashhur, the priest who had Jeremiah arrested and placed in stocks, was a descendant of Immer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer20:1\">Jer 20:1</a>). There were 1,052 priests of the subclan of Immer who returned from the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr9:12\">1&nbsp;Chr 9:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:37\">Ezr 2:37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:40\">Neh 7:40</a>). A descendant of Immer helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:29\">Neh 3:29</a>) and 128 priests under Amashsai (also a descendant) helped resettle the city and tend the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:13-Neh11:14\">Neh 11:13â€“14</a>).</p>",
