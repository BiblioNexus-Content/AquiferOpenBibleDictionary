    "content": "<h1>ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA</h1><p>Two Midianite kings who slaughtered Gideon’s brothers at Tabor. Gideon subsequently killed them in order to avenge his brothers’ deaths (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21\">Jgs 8:18–21</a>).</p><p>During Gideon’s day, Midianite camel raiders annually made forays into Israelite territory at harvesttime, stealing crops and livestock (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:3\">Jgs 6:3</a>). So complete were their raids that nothing was left in Israel, including crops, sheep, oxen, or donkeys.</p><p>In this state of affairs God called Gideon to deliver Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:16\">Jgs 6:16</a>). His well-known victory over Midian near Mt Moreh was an important step toward realization of this divine commission (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:1-Judg7:23\">7:1–23</a>). In the operations following the battle, Ephraimite warriors captured and assassinated two Midianite leaders named Zeeb and Oreb (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:24-Judg8:3\">7:24–8:3</a>).</p><p>Gideon determined to capture Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of the Midianite forces. In tracking them down, he crossed the Jordan River and traveled more than 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) from the site of the original battle. Along the way, two successive towns, Succoth and Penuel, refused to help Gideon and his men, doubtless fearing reprisal from the Midianite raiders should Gideon fail to defeat them.</p><p>Gideon routed the remaining Midianite warriors and captured Zebah and Zalmunna (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:12\">Jgs 8:12</a>). Because Zebah and Zalmunna had killed his brothers, Gideon killed the two Midianite kings (vv <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:19-Judg8:21\">19–21</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps83:11\">Psalm 83:11</a> indicates that Zebah, Zalmunna, and the Midianites were the enemies not merely of Israel but also of God.</p>",
