It was in the Negev, which is the southern desert region (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:22\">Joshua 15:22</a>). In the Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament), the name is sometimes written as Ararah<em>,</em> or “Aroer” in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:28\">1&nbsp;Samuel 30:28</a>. It may be modern-day Khirbet Ar’arah, located 12 miles (19 kilometers) south of Beersheba.</p>",
