    "content": "<h1>PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER</h1><ol><li><p>An Egyptian princess who rescued the infant Moses and adopted him as her own son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod2:5-Exod2:10\">Exodus 2:5–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:21\">Acts 7:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:24\">Hebrews 11:24</a>). If we accept an early date for the exodus (when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt), this foster mother of Moses could have been Hatshepsut. Some scholars who accept a later date for the exodus believe the pharaoh of the oppression was Ramses II. If so, this princess may have been the daughter of Seti I or a later 18th dynasty pharaoh. She was likely born to a concubine from a royal harem near the region of Goshen.</p></li><li><p>An Egyptian princess, one of the two wives of Mered (a descendant of Caleb) who gave birth to three children (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr4:17\">1&nbsp;Chronicles 4:17</a>). Her name,<strong> </strong>Bithiah (meaning “daughter of the Lord”), implies that she was converted to the worship of Israel’s God. It is not known which pharaoh was her father.</p></li><li><p>A princess whom Solomon married to form an alliance with Egypt. Her father was probably Siamun, who ruled from 978 to 959 BC. He gave to Solomon the town of Gezer as a marriage gift (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:1\">1&nbsp;Kings 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:16\">9:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1\">11:1</a>). Solomon built her a palace in Jerusalem because he would not have her live in David’s house (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:8\">1&nbsp;Kings 7:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:24\">9:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr8:11\">2&nbsp;Chronicles 8:11</a>).</p></li></ol>",
