    "content": "<h1>JESHUA (Person)</h1><p>1. Levite and head of the ninth of 24 divisions of priests formed during David’s reign (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr24:11\">1&nbsp;Chr 24:11</a>). He was perhaps the forefather of 973 descendants who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36\">Ezr 2:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:39\">Neh 7:39</a>).</p><p>2. One of the Levites assisting Kore in the distribution of the offerings among his fellow priests living in the priestly cities of Judah during the days of King Hezekiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr31:15\">2&nbsp;Chr 31:15</a>).</p><p>3. Son of Jozadak (alternately “Jehozadak”) the high priest. Jozadak was deported by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr6:14-1Chr6:15\">1&nbsp;Chr 6:14–15</a>). Jeshua, Jozadak’s successor as high priest, returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem after the exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2\">Ezr 2:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:7\">Neh 7:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:1\">12:1</a>). Upon arrival, he led his fellow priests in making the altar of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2\">Ezr 3:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra5:2\">5:2</a>) and eventually headed up a construction program to rebuild the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8\">3:8</a>). Confirmed as God’s leader by Haggai and Zechariah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:1-Hag1:14\">Hg 1:1–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:2,Hag2:4\">2:2, 4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech3:1-Zech3:9\">Zec 3:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech6:11\">6:11</a>), Jeshua (alternately “Joshua” in these passages) resolutely resisted attempts by adversaries to infiltrate his people and hinder the work on the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra4:3\">Ezr 4:3</a>). Joiakim was Jeshua’s son and successor as high priest, serving in the days of Nehemiah and Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:12,Neh12:26\">Neh 12:12, 26</a>).</p><p>4. Descendant of Pahath-moab and the forefather of a family of Jews who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the Babylonian captivity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:6\">Ezr 2:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:11\">Neh 7:11</a>).</p><p>5. Father of a family of Levites who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40\">Ezr 2:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:43\">Neh 7:43</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh12:8\">12:8</a>). He and his sons were responsible for overseeing the workmen building the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra3:9\">Ezr 3:9</a>; this Jeshua may be identical with #3 above).</p><p>6. Levite and Jozabad’s father. Jozabad assisted Meremoth, Eleazar, and Noadiah with taking inventory of the temple’s precious metals and vessels during the days of Ezra (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33\">Ezr 8:33</a>).</p><p>7. Ezer’s father. Ezer was ruler of Mizpah, who repaired a&nbsp;section of the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:19\">Neh 3:19</a>).</p><p>8. Azaniah’s son and a leader of the Levites in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. Jeshua assisted Ezra with teaching the people the law (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:7\">Neh 8:7</a>) and later set his seal on Ezra’s covenant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh10:9\">10:9</a>).</p><p>9. Alternate spelling of Joshua, the son of Nun, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh8:17\">Nehemiah 8:17</a>. <em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"5627\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Joshua (Person) #1</span>.</p>",
