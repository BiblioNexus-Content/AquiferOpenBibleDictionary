These were sometimes described by the numbers, first, second, third, and fourth. Or they were sometimes described as evening, midnight, cock-crowing, and morning (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt14:25\">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark6:48\">Mark 6:48</a>). The respective watches ended at roughly 21:00, 00:00 (midnight), 03:00, and 06:00. </p><p><em>See</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6571\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Night</span>.</p>",
