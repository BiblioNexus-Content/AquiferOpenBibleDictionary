It began in the hill country of Judah, about 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem, and took a northwesterly course to the Mediterranean Sea. It&nbsp;is identifiable with the Wadi es-Sarar. The Danites attempted to settle this area but were driven out by the Philistines in the region by the Mediterranean. The town of Zorah, Samsonâ€™s birthplace, was near the head of the valley of Zorek, which provided the setting for his intrigues and the concentration of his activities as judge.</p>",
