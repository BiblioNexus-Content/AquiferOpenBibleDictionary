    "content": "<h1>EPHOD (Garment)</h1><p>An ephod was a special upper garment worn during religious services at the tabernacle or temple. The term &quot;ephod&quot; generally referred to the decorated vest that the high priest wore over a blue robe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:31\">Exodus 28:31</a>). The ephod held the Urim and Thummim, which were holy objects (lots) used to determine God&apos;s will. Sometimes &quot;ephod&quot; meant the complete outfit of the high priest or similar clothes worn by other priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:28\">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:6,1Sam23:9\">23:6, 9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:7\">30:7</a>).</p><p>The ephod was made of colored material and fine linen. It was decorated with blue, purple, scarlet, and gold thread. At the upper part were two shoulder straps. Each strap had an onyx stone with the names of Israel&apos;s 12 tribes engraved on it. The breastplate, which also contained the tribal names, was attached to the ephod by a series of cords and chains (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:22-Exod28:29\">Exodus 28:22–29</a>).</p><p>Jewish writers suggest different possible appearances for the ephod:</p><ol><li><p>Like an apron, covering the body from the chest to the heels;</p></li><li><p>Covering the body only from the waist down, with the upper body covered by the breastplate; or</p></li><li><p>Like a jacket with sleeves, with the middle of the chest uncovered so the breastplate could be inserted easily.</p></li></ol><p>Before the Babylonian exile (when the people of Israel were taken to Babylon), the ephod was used as a way to receive messages from God, especially about military matters. Abiathar the priest once brought the ephod to David&apos;s camp so they could ask God for guidance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:6-1Sam23:9\">1&nbsp;Samuel 23:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam30:7\">30:7</a>). It is not clear whether the priest wore the ephod or held it while seeking God&apos;s will through the Urim and Thummim..</p><p>During the period of the judges, the ephod was often misused. Gideon, Micah, and Jonathan, the grandson of Moses, all misused it  (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:27\">Judges 8:27</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:5\"> 17:5</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:5\"> </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:30\">18:30</a>; compare verses <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:14\">14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:17\">17</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg18:20\">20</a>).</p><p>Either the garment itself or an image representing God, on which the garment was placed, was worshiped as people sought guidance in ways that God had forbidden. Household idols (called teraphim) were also part of this ungodly practice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg17:5\">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos3:4\">Hosea 3:4</a>).</p><p>Besides the high priest, other priests wore an ephod for certain religious services (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:18\">1&nbsp;Samuel 22:18</a>). Even Samuel and David wore one (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:18\">1 Samuel 2:18</a>;<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:14\"> 6:14</a>). y the time after the exile, and perhaps as early as Solomon&apos;s reign, the ephod was no longer used for seeking God&apos;s guidance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:63\">Ezra 2:63</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:65\">Nehemiah 7:65</a>). There was no need for the ephod or Urim once God spoke through prophets, as Moses had promised (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut18:15-Deut18:22\">Deuteronomy 18:15–22</a>). However, the high priest continued to wear this special garment until the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.</p><p><em>See also</em> <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"6984\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleBibleDictionary\">Priests and Levites</span>.</p>",
