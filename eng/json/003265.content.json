Indications of its location are sketchy. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg8:11\">Judges 8:11</a> places it east of Nobah and Jog-behah, a town identified with Jubeiah, which is seven miles (11.3&nbsp;kilometers) northwest of Amman in Jordan. A more feasible site is in the vicinity of ancient Succoth (Tell Dier ‘Alla) and Penuel (Tell edh-Dhahab esh-Sherqiyeh), both assigned to Gad’s tribe in Gilead.</p>",
