They first built it on a small island separate from Lesbos. </p><p>In New Testament times, a raised roadway across a narrow stretch of water connected it with the main island. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:14\">Acts 20:14</a> identifies Mitylene as one of the overnight stopping places where Paul and his traveling companions lodged. This was as they journeyed by ship toward Jerusalem.</p>",
