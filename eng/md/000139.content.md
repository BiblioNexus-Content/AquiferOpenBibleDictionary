ADRAMYTTIUM
===========

An ancient port city in Asia Minor. When travelling to Rome as a prisoner, Paul sailed on a ship from Adramyttium ([Acts 27:2](https://ref.ly/Acts27:2)). Adramyttium is the modern\-day Turkish city of Edremit. Coins found in the area indicate that Adramyttium may have been a center for the worship of Castor and Pollux (twin sons of the pagan god, Zeus).
