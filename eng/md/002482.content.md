## Hazer-Hatticon (id: 5736)

HAZER\-HATTICON
===============

Boundary marker along Israel’s northern perimeter ([Ez 47:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:16)). In conjunction with the use of Hazar\-enan in this context, and in comparison with [Numbers 34:9–10](https://ref.ly/Num34:9-Num34:10), it appears that Hazer\-hatticon may represent a scribal error for Hazar\-enan.

* **Associated Passages:** EZK 47:16; NUM 34:9–NUM 34:10
