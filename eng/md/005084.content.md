## Shema, the (id: 8349)

SHEMA, The
==========

The declaration “Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God is one Yahweh” ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4)). The name, Shema, comes from the first Hebrew word of the verse, *shema,* “hear.” [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:9) contains all of this essential biblical truth. While several translations of verse [4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4) are grammatically correct, Jesus’s words in [Mark 12:29](https://ref.ly/Mark12:29) match the above translation best. Religious Jews pray the Shema three times a day as a devotion. No Sabbath worship occurs in the synagogue without it.

The Shema contains a key doctrinal truth and an obligation. The Shema demands that the hearers respond with their total being to this important revelation.

Regarding the nature of God, the word “one” (*echad*) means a compound unity, not an absolute singular. The medieval Jewish theologian Maimonides argued that God was *yachid* (an absolute singular). But, the Old Testament does not use this word to describe God. The word "*echad*" first occurs in [Genesis 2:24,](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24) where a man and woman are made one (*echad*) in marriage. This is how Jesus could quote [Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4) without denying his own deity.
