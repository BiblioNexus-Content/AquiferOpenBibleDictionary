SHAREZER
========

1\. One of the sons of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. In 681 BC he, along with his brother Adrammelech, killed Sennacherib while he was praying in the house of Nisroch ([2 Kgs 19:37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:37); [Is 37:38](https://ref.ly/Isa37:38)).

2\. One who was sent from Bethel to inquire of the priests and prophets as to whether or not the mourning and feasting in commemoration of the destruction of the temple should be confined to the fifth month of that year. Since the temple was nearing its restoration, there was some question about the commemoration on the part of the populace at Bethel ([Zec 7:2–3](https://ref.ly/Zech7:2-Zech7:3)).
