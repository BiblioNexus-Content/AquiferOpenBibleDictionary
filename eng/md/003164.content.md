## Jokneam (id: 6423)

JOKNEAM
=======

Royal Canaanite city belonging to Carmel ([Jos 12:22](https://ref.ly/Josh12:22)), mentioned also by Thutmose III as “the Well of Q.” The border of Zebulun touched on the stream near Jokneam ([19:11](https://ref.ly/Josh19:11)); the town became a Levitical city in Zebulun ([21:34](https://ref.ly/Josh21:34)). Some think that Jokmeam of [1 Kings 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:12) should be amended to Jokneam, but this is not certain. Eusebius placed it six miles (9\.7 kilometers) from Legio (beside Megiddo) on the way to Ptolemais. This is Tell Qaimun, at the mouth of Wadi Milh on the edge of the Jezreel Valley.
