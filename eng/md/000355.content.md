## Anna (id: 3619)

ANNA
====

Phanuel’s daughter from Asher’s tribe. She was an elderly prophetess in Jerusalem when Jesus was a young child. She worshiped with prayer and fasting day and night in the temple. When Jesus was brought by his parents and presented to the Lord in the temple, she visited the family. She thanked God and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem ([Luke 2:36–38](https://ref.ly/Luke2:36-Luke2:38)).
