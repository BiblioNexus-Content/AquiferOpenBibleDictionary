## Behemoth (id: 4079)

BEHEMOTH
========

A plural Hebrew word usually translated “beasts” or “wild animals” (as in [Deuteronomy 28:26](https://ref.ly/Deut28:26); [32:24](https://ref.ly/Deut32:24); [Psalm 50:10](https://ref.ly/Ps50:10); [Isaiah 18:6](https://ref.ly/Isa18:6); [2 Esdras 6:49, 51](https://ref.ly/2Esd6:49,2Esd6:51); [Habakkuk 2:17](https://ref.ly/Hab2:17)). Most English translations only refer to a “behemoth” once, when the context seems to refer to the specific animal. The animal was large and powerful. Many biblical scholars believe that it was a hippopotamus ([Job 40:15](https://ref.ly/Job40:15)). In ancient times, the hippopotamus was well known in Egypt and may have lived in the Jordan Valley. [Job 40:23](https://ref.ly/Job40:23) may refer to any river that flooded like the Jordan in flood season.
