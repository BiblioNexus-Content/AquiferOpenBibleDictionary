## Willow (id: 9069)

WILLOW
======

A willow is a tree or shrub with long, narrow leaves and flexible branches.

In the Bible, the word “willow” may refer to several kinds of trees that grow near water. Some Bible translations use the word “aspen” for these same trees because the exact species is uncertain ([Leviticus 23:40](https://ref.ly/Lev23:40); [Job 40:22](https://ref.ly/Job40:22); [Isaiah 15:7](https://ref.ly/Isa15:7)).
