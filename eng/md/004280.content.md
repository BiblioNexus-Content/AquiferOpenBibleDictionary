## Overseer (id: 7537)

OVERSEER
========

A word that appears 12 times in the Old Testament (King James Version) and once in the New Testament. The New International Version uses it at least six times in the New Testament to translate the Greek word *episkopos.* The word *episkopos* is derived from “peer” or “watch over.” In the Old Testament, “overseer” is used to translate three words, which mean

1. one with authority who visits,
2. the preeminent one, or
3. the head writer.

Joseph was given authority to watch over and administer all aspects of Potiphar’s house ([Genesis 39:4–5](https://ref.ly/Gen39:4-Gen39:5)). He advised Pharaoh to appoint fifty men to regulate and watch over the abundant harvest for seven years ([41:34](https://ref.ly/Gen41:34)). Solomon appointed 3,600 overseers (“supervisors” in the New American Standard Bible) to make the people work ([2 Chronicles 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:18)). In Josiah’s time of temple renovation, there were overseers over all the workmen in every job ([34:13, 17](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:13,2Chr34:17)). Nehemiah appointed men to oversee the rebuilding of the wall ([Nehemiah 11:9, 14](https://ref.ly/Neh11:9,Neh11:14)), to oversee the Levites (verse [22](https://ref.ly/Neh11:22)), and to be in charge of the Levitical singers ([12:42](https://ref.ly/Neh12:42)).

The word “overseer” speaks of the highest person of authority who exercised oversight over others. Included in this authoritative oversight was the idea of watching, directing, and protecting the master’s interests. The New Testament communicates these ideas also regarding men appointed to serve the church on behalf of Jesus Christ ([Acts 20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28); [Philippians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Phil1:1); [1 Timothy 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:1-1Tim3:2); [Titus 1:7](https://ref.ly/Titus1:7)). Jesus Christ himself is the great Overseer ([1 Peter 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:25), New International Version).
