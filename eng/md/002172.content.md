## Gergesa, Gergesenes (id: 5427)

GERGESA, GERGESENES
===================

A city on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. Gergesa is near Gadara, which is probably where Jesus healed a demon\-possessed man and cast the demons into a nearby herd of pigs. Though the account of this miracle in [Matthew 8:28](https://ref.ly/Matt8:28) refers to “the region of the Gadarenes,” it is most likely that Matthew used the reference to Gergesa to refer to the region rather than the specific location. 

*See* Gadara, Gadarenes; Gerasa, Gerasenes.
