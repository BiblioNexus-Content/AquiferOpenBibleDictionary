## Siloam, Tower of (id: 8495)

SILOAM, Tower of
================

A large building that collapsed, killing 18 people. Jesus compared those killed by the fallen tower to the rest of the people living in Jerusalem ([Luke 13:4](https://ref.ly/Luke13:4-Luke13:5)–[5](https://ref.ly/Luke13:4-Luke13:5)). 

Nothing is known of this tower other than it was probably in Jerusalem. It might be the great tower built by Nehemiah on the wall of Ophel ([2 Chronicles 27:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3); [Nehemiah 3:26](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26-Neh3:27)–[27](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26-Neh3:27)). It might also be one of the towers built on the wall of Jerusalem near the pool of Siloam.
