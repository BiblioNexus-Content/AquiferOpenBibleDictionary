## Lasea (id: 6684)

LASEA
=====

A seaport city on the island of Crete. It was located about 8 kilometers (five miles) east of Fair Havens. The ship of the apostle Paul passed Lasea on its way to Italy ([Acts 27:8](https://ref.ly/Acts27:8)). 

We do not know much about Lasea. It is probably in ruins near Fair Havens. It may be the same as the Lasos mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his *Natural History* (4\.12\.59\). Pliny says Lasea was famous in the ancient world. Its region contained 100 cities and it was one of most important ports of Crete.
