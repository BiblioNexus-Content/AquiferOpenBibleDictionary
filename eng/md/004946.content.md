1\. Youngest son of Hiel the Bethelite. Hiel rebuilt Jericho during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. His violation of Joshua’s curse against anyone rebuilding the city ([Jos 6:26](https://ref.ly/Josh6:26)) cost him his oldest and youngest sons. Segub was killed as a result of the rebuilding of the city gates ([1 Kgs 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:34)).

2\. Son borne to Hezron by the daughter of Makir, the father of Gilead. Segub was the father of Jair ([1 Chr 2:21–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:21-1Chr2:22)).
