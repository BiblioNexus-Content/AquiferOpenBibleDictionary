## Cruse (id: 4701)

CRUSE\*
=======

Small earthen vessel or flask, about four to six inches (10 to15 centimeters) tall, used for holding liquids ([1 Kgs 17:12–16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:12-1Kgs17:16)). In the kjv, two other Hebrew words are translated “cruse.” However, a bottle or jar is probably in view in [1 Kings 14:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:3), and an open dish or bowl in [2 Kings 2:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:20).
