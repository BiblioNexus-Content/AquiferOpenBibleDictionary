## Heart (id: 5750)

Heart
=====

The heart is a vital organ. "Heart" can also mean the emotional center of a person.

In Hebrew and Greek, as in modern English, "heart" refers to both a physical organ and the emotional center of a person. The Hebrew word *lēb* and the Greek word *kardia* are usually translated as “heart.”. Together they appear about 1,000 times in the Bible, although some translations use different words to express the meaning. These words have a wide range of meaning.

The Physical Heart
------------------

The beating of the heart is a sign of life. This idea appears in the story of Nabal, who was struck down and later died ([1 Samuel 25:37–39](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:37-1Sam25:39)). Food and wine can affect the heart by strengthening or gladdening it ([Judges 19:5](https://ref.ly/Judg19:5); [Psalm 104:15](https://ref.ly/Ps104:15); [Acts 14:17](https://ref.ly/Acts14:17)). The Bible also speaks of the heart as able to “faint” or “tremble.” Because the heart is located at the center of the body, it became a natural picture for “the center” of something ([Matthew 12:40](https://ref.ly/Matt12:40)).

The Psychological Heart
-----------------------

The Bible often uses the word *heart* to describe the center of human thought and decision\-making. Some translations use the word *mind* when referring to this idea of the psychological heart. The heart can pay attention (for example, [Jeremiah 12:11](https://ref.ly/Jer12:11)). The heart also: 

* perceives ([John 12:40](https://ref.ly/John12:40)),
* understands ([1 Kings 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:9)),
* debates ([Mark 2:6](https://ref.ly/Mark2:6)),
* reflects ([Luke 2:19](https://ref.ly/Luke2:19)),
* remembers ([Luke 2:51](https://ref.ly/Luke2:51)),
* thinks ([Deuteronomy 8:17](https://ref.ly/Deut8:17)),
* imagines ([Luke 1:51](https://ref.ly/Luke1:51)),
* is wise ([Ecclesiastes 1:17](https://ref.ly/Eccl1:17)), and
* has technical skill ([Exodus 28:3](https://ref.ly/Exod28:3)).

The heart feels many emotions, such as: 

* intoxicated happiness ([1 Samuel 25:36](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:36)),
* gladness ([Isaiah 30:29](https://ref.ly/Isa30:29)),
* joy ([John 16:22](https://ref.ly/John16:22)),
* sorrow ([Nehemiah 2:2](https://ref.ly/Neh2:2)),
* anguish ([Romans 9:2](https://ref.ly/Rom9:2)),
* bitterness ([Proverbs 14:10](https://ref.ly/Prov14:10)),
* anxiety ([1 Samuel 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:13)),
* despair ([Ecclesiastes 2:20](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:20)),
* love ([2 Samuel 14:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:1)),
* trust ([Psalms 112:7](https://ref.ly/Ps112:7)),
* affection ([2 Corinthians 7:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor7:3)),
* lust ([Matthew 5:28](https://ref.ly/Matt5:28)),
* callousness ([Mark 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mark3:5)),
* hatred ([Leviticus 19:17](https://ref.ly/Lev19:17)),
* fear ([Genesis 42:28](https://ref.ly/Gen42:28)),
* jealousy ([James 3:14](https://ref.ly/Jas3:14)),
* desire ([Romans 10:1](https://ref.ly/Rom10:1)),
* discouragement ([Numbers 32:9](https://ref.ly/Num32:9)),
* sympathy ([Exodus 23:9](https://ref.ly/Exod23:9)),
* anger ([Deuteronomy 19:6](https://ref.ly/Deut19:6)), and
* indecision ([2 Chronicles 13:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:7)).

The Bible also shows the heart as the center of a person’s will. The heart can:

* plan or purpose ([1 Corinthians 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:5)),

* lean or incline towards something ([1 Samuel 14:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:7)),
* prompt a person to act ([2 Kings 12:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:4); compare [Proverbs 4:23](https://ref.ly/Prov4:23)),
* remain steadfast and firm ([Acts 11:23](https://ref.ly/Acts11:23)),
* be eager and willing ([Exodus 35:22](https://ref.ly/Exod35:22)),
* plan evil acts ([Acts 5:4](https://ref.ly/Acts5:4)), or
* follow its "treasure" ([Matthew 6:21](https://ref.ly/Matt6:21)).

The Bible describes the morally good qualities that can come from the heart. The heart can be:

* gentle and humble ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29)),
* holy ([1 Thessalonians 3:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:13)),
* faithful ([Nehemiah 9:8](https://ref.ly/Neh9:8)),
* upright ([Psalms 97:11](https://ref.ly/Ps97:11)),
* pure, focused ([James 4:8](https://ref.ly/Jas4:8)),
* clean ([Acts 15:8](https://ref.ly/Acts15:8)),
* loving toward God ([Mark 12:30](https://ref.ly/Mark12:30)),
* loving toward others ([1 Peter 1:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:22)), and
* hardened or sensitive ([Ezekiel 11:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:19)).

Scripture often stresses the evil that comes from the heart ([Genesis 6:5](https://ref.ly/Gen6:5) and throughout). The heart can be: 

* self\-deceiving ([James 1:26](https://ref.ly/Jas1:26)),
* deceitful ([Jeremiah 17:9](https://ref.ly/Jer17:9)),
* greedy ([Matthew 6:19–21](https://ref.ly/Matt6:19-Matt6:21)),
* lustful ([Matthew 5:28](https://ref.ly/Matt5:28)),
* arrogant or proud ([Isaiah 9:9](https://ref.ly/Isa9:9)),
* rebllious agaomst God ([Acts 7:51](https://ref.ly/Acts7:51)),
* perverse ([Psalms 101:4](https://ref.ly/Ps101:4)), and
* unwilling to repent ([Romans 2:5](https://ref.ly/Rom2:5)).

Jesus taught that nothing makes a person more unclean than what comes from the human heart ([Mark 7:18–19](https://ref.ly/Mark7:18-Mark7:19)).

But the Bible also teaches that good can come from the heart ([Luke 6:45](https://ref.ly/Luke6:45); [8:15](https://ref.ly/Luke8:15)). Even when fear or circumstances prevent action, the intention of the heart still matters. A good intention is counted as good, and an evil intention is counted as evil ([1 Kings 8:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:18); [Matthew 5:28](https://ref.ly/Matt5:28)).

Because the heart is complex, it can become divided. Scripture praises a heart that is whole, perfect, and true—that is, a united heart ([Genesis 20:5](https://ref.ly/Gen20:5); [Psalms 86:11](https://ref.ly/Ps86:11); [Acts 8:37](https://ref.ly/Acts8:37)). The word *heart* often refers to the total inner self, the hidden core of who a person is ([1 Peter 3:4](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:4)). With the heart a person communes with God, pouring out feelings in prayer, words, and deeds ([Psalms 62:8](https://ref.ly/Ps62:8); [Matthew 15:18–19](https://ref.ly/Matt15:18-Matt15:19)). The heart is the true self, different from appearance, public role, and physical presence ([1 Samuel 16:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:7); [2 Corinthians 5:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:12); [1 Thessalonians 2:17](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:17)). This inner self has its own nature, character, and disposition (translated as "mind" in [Daniel 4:16](https://ref.ly/Dan4:16); [7:4](https://ref.ly/Dan7:4); see also [Matthew 12:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33-Matt12:37)).

The Spiritual Heart
-------------------

The heart is especially important in biblical faith. The hidden self, which is a mystery to others, is fully known by God and by Christ ([Jeremiah 17:10](https://ref.ly/Jer17:10); [Luke 9:47](https://ref.ly/Luke9:47); [Romans 8:27](https://ref.ly/Rom8:27)). The heart is where we understand God ([2 Corinthians 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:6)). The heart's condition affects how we see God ([Matthew 5:8](https://ref.ly/Matt5:8)). We speak to God from the heart ([Psalm 27:8](https://ref.ly/Ps27:8)). The heart is where God dwells within us ([2 Corinthians 1:22](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:22); [Galatians 4:6](https://ref.ly/Gal4:6); [Ephesians 3:17](https://ref.ly/Eph3:17)).

On the other hand, moral evil in the heart is understood in the Bible as sin against God. A heart without understanding becomes darkened, often hiding idolatry, and is far from God. Such a heart is “not right” before God ([Deuteronomy 29:18–19](https://ref.ly/Deut29:18-Deut29:19); [Matthew 15:8](https://ref.ly/Matt15:8); [Acts 8:21](https://ref.ly/Acts8:21); [Romans 1:21](https://ref.ly/Rom1:21)). Yet the Lord does not reject a heart that is broken and contrite ([Psalms 51:17](https://ref.ly/Ps51:17)). When a person turns their heart toward God, God promises to make it sensitive to his ways, renewed, and purified ([Deuteronomy 4:29](https://ref.ly/Deut4:29); [2 Kings 23:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:25); [Psalms 51:10](https://ref.ly/Ps51:10); [Joel 2:13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13); [Ezekiel 36:25–27](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:25-Ezek36:27)). God’s law is then written on the heart as an inward guide and motivation ([Jeremiah 31:33](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33); [Hebrew 8:10](https://ref.ly/Heb8:10); see also [2 Corinthians 3:2–3](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:2-2Cor3:3)).

In Christian teaching, this transformation begins when a person believes the good news from an “honest and good heart.” Such a heart is like good soil that produces fruit when the word of God is planted in i ([Luke 8:15](https://ref.ly/Luke8:15); [Romans 10:9](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9)). A true heart comes closer to God and loves God with all its mind, emotions, and will ([Luke 10:27](https://ref.ly/Luke10:27); [Hebrews 10:22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22)). God then gives strength, reward, renewal, grace, peace, and joy to the heart ([Psalms 73:26](https://ref.ly/Ps73:26); [Isaiah 57:15](https://ref.ly/Isa57:15); [Acts 2:46](https://ref.ly/Acts2:46); [Philippians 4:7](https://ref.ly/Phil4:7); [Hebrews 13:9](https://ref.ly/Heb13:9)). In this way, the ancient ideal becomes possible again: to be a person after God’s own heart ([1 Samuel 13:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:14); [Acts 13:22](https://ref.ly/Acts13:22)).
