JOHN (Person)
=============

1. The father of Simon Peter and Andrew ([John 1:40](https://ref.ly/John1:40-John1:42)[–](https://ref.ly/John1:40-John1:42)[42](https://ref.ly/John1:40-John1:42); [21:15](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)[–](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)[17](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)). According to [Matthew 16:17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17), Peter’s father was named Jona (Jonas, Jonah). Jona was either another version of the name John or two stories existed about his name.
2. A member of the high priestly family who, along with Annas, Caiaphas, and Alexander, questioned Peter and John after the two apostles had healed a lame man ([Acts 4:6](https://ref.ly/Acts4:6)).
3. According to the early church bishop Papias, a member of the larger group of Jesus’ disciples outside the Twelve (compare [Luke 10:1](https://ref.ly/Luke10:1)). Known as “John the elder," he is often said to have written 2 and 3 John ([2 John 1:1](https://ref.ly/2John1:1); [3 John 1:1](https://ref.ly/3John1:1)). The term “elder” more likely refers to John the apostle.

5. The Baptist. *See* John the Baptist.
6. An early disciple known as John Mark, author of the second Gospel. *See* Mark, John.
