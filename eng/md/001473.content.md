## Cyamon (id: 4723)

CYAMON
======

Site mentioned in the book of Judith as demarcating the camp of Holofernes’ army ([Jdt 7:3](https://ref.ly/Jdt7:3)). The name is uncertain: “Cyamon” is found in the Greek text, but the Syriac has “Cadmon.” Two later Hebrew manuscripts have “Selmon,” another “Hermon.” The Latin Vulgate has “Chelmon.” Some scholars have connected the site with Jokneam, modern Tell Qeimum ([Jos 12:22](https://ref.ly/Josh12:22)). The only clue in the book of Judith is that it faced Esdraelon, the western portion of the plain of Jezreel.
