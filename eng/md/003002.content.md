## Jedaiah (id: 6257)

JEDAIAH
=======

1\. Shimri’s son and the father of Allon. He is listed in the genealogical tables of the Simeonites who settled in the valley of Gedor in Hezekiah’s time ([1 Chr 4:37](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:37)).

2\. Harumaph’s son, who helped repair the Jerusalem wall after the exile ([Neh 3:10](https://ref.ly/Neh3:10)).

3\. Aaron’s descendant and head of the second of the 24 priestly divisions for temple service in David’s time ([1 Chr 24:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:7)). His descendants are listed among the returned exiles ([1 Chr 9:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:10); [Ezr 2:36](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36); [Neh 7:39](https://ref.ly/Neh7:39)). The individuals and families listed below are probably a part of this priestly line, but their exact relationships are difficult to determine.

4\. Provincial priest who agreed to resettle in postexilic Jerusalem ([Neh 11:10](https://ref.ly/Neh11:10); cf. v [2](https://ref.ly/Neh11:2)).

5\. Priest who returned with Zerubbabel after the exile ([Neh 12:6–7](https://ref.ly/Neh12:6-Neh12:7)). In the next generation this was the name of a family (v [21](https://ref.ly/Neh12:21)).

6\. One of the exiles taken by Zechariah as witness to the symbolic crowning of Joshua (nlt “Jeshua”). He may be the same as \#4 or \#5 above. He came back from captivity bringing gifts for the temple in the days of the high priest Joshua ([Zec 6:10–14](https://ref.ly/Zech6:10-Zech6:14)).
