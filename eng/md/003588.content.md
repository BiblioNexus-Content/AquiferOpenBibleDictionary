## Madon (id: 6846)

MADON
=====

One of the many Canaanite cities allied against Joshua in a vain attempt to stop the progress of the Israelites into Palestine. A disastrous battle fought at Meron brought these cities under Israelite control ([Jos 11:1](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1); [12:19](https://ref.ly/Josh12:19)). Madon is probably the modern Qarn Hattin, about five miles (8 kilometers) from the Sea of Galilee.
