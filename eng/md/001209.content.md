## Chabris (id: 4463)

CHABRIS
=======

Chabris was the son of Gothoniel. He was one of three civil officers (magistrates) of Bethulia ([Judith 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Jdt6:14-Jdt6:15); [10:6](https://ref.ly/Jdt10:6)). When the Assyrians attacked the town, Chabris and the other leaders said they would only wait a few more days for God to save them. If nothing happened, they planned to surrender.

Judith rebuked them for this. She told them not to test God or give him a time limit ([Judith 8:9–27](https://ref.ly/Jdt8:9-Jdt8:27)).
