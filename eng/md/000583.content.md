## Asylum (id: 3851)

ASYLUM
======

A safe place where someone who is accused of a crime can go to avoid being arrested or punished. It can also refer to the protection such a place offers. This concept is similar to the term “sanctuary.” In ancient times, people would often run to altars or temples for protection. For example, Adonijah and Joab sought sanctuary from King Solomon at the altar of the tabernacle ([1 Kings 1:50](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53)–[53;](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:53) [2:28–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:31)). In the law of Moses, asylum was given through cities of refuge.
