## Kish (id: 6622)

KISH
====

1. A Benjamite from Gibeah, father of King Saul and a man of importance in his town ([1 Samuel 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:1)). His ancestry is traced for four generations. So is Elkanah's, the father of Samuel, who would anoint Saul king ([1 Samuel 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1)).

    Kish's family details are somewhat unclear. His father’s name is listed as Abiel in [1 Samuel 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:1). If the Kish mentioned in [1 Chronicles 8:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:30) is the same person, then Abiel was also known as Jeiel. But it may be that this second Kish was an uncle of Saul’s father. In [1 Chronicles 8:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:33) and [9:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:39), Ner, not Abiel, is said to be the father of Kish. Yet in [1 Samuel 14:51](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51), Abiel is said to be the father of two sons whose names were Ner and Kish. The solution is that the Ner in Chronicles was an earlier ancestor, probably Abiel's father or grandfather. If so, then, the father\-son relationship between Ner and Kish should be taken in an extended sense, as elsewhere in the Old Testament. No other details of Kish’s life are available. His grave was in Zela of Benjamin ([2 Samuel 21:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:14)). The King James Version spells his name Cis in [Acts 13:21](https://ref.ly/Acts13:21).

2. A Levite, grandson of Merari, Mahli’s son and the father of Jerahmeel ([1 Chronicles 23:21–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:21-1Chr23:22); [24:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:29)).
3. Abdi’s son, another Levite of the family of Merari. He was one of the Levites who helped Hezekiah cleanse the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12)).
4. A Benjamite and the great\-grandfather of Mordecai. Mordecai was brought into exile by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 BC ([Esther 2:5](https://ref.ly/Esth2:5)), with King Jehoiachin and the prophet Ezekiel.
