## Kenizzites (id: 6551)

KENIZZITES
==========

A people related to Kenaz, grandson of Esau ([Gn 36:11, 15](https://ref.ly/Gen36:11,Gen36:15)). The Kenizzites were of Edomite stock and resided to the southeast of Judah in the vicinity of the Kenites. They are thought to belong to the pre\-Israelite population of Canaan ([Gn 15:19](https://ref.ly/Gen15:19)). Their territory was to be given to the Israelites along with that of the Kenites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites (vv [19–21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:19-Gen15:21)).

In Numbers and Joshua, Caleb, the faithful spy, is reckoned to belong to the Kenizzites ([Nm 32:12](https://ref.ly/Num32:12); [Jos 14:6, 14](https://ref.ly/Josh14:6,Josh14:14)). According to [1 Chronicles 4:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:15), Caleb’s genealogy is traced back to Judah ([1 Chr 4:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:1)). The relationship of Caleb to the Kenizzites is far from clear. Caleb established his patrimony at Kiriath\-sepher ([Jgs 1:11–13](https://ref.ly/Judg1:11-Judg1:13)), which is in Judah but which is also situated close to the territory of the Kenizzites. Critical opinion views the Kenizzites as non\-Israelites who occupied Hebron, Debir, and the southernmost hill country of the Negev and became politically incorporated into Judah.
