## Jehucal (id: 6293)

JEHUCAL
=======

A son of Shelemiah who King Zedekiah sent to request prayer for Judah from the prophet Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 37:3](https://ref.ly/Jer37:3); [38:1](https://ref.ly/Jer38:1)). Later he tried to kill Jeremiah. This was because Jeremiah continued to prophesy that the Babylonians would invade Jerusalem. Jehucal thought the prophesying of Jeremiah discouraged the people and the army ([38:1–6](https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:6)).
