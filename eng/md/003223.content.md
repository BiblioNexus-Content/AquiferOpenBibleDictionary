## Judas (id: 6486)

JUDAS
=====

1. Judas Iscariot was one of Jesus's 12 disciples. His father was Simon and his last name was Iscariot. It is not clear why he is called Iscariot. Iscariot probably means he was born in a town called Kerioth. There are two towns with this name. Kerioth of Moab is east of the Jordan ([Jeremiah 48:24](https://ref.ly/Jer48:24); [Amos 2:2](https://ref.ly/Amos2:2)). Kerioth\-hezron or Hazor is in southern Judah ([Joshua 15:25](https://ref.ly/Josh15:25)). A less likely idea connects Iscariot with an Aramaic word meaning “assassin” (a person who commits murder, especially for political reasons or for money). According to this idea, after Judas betrayed Jesus, people started calling him "Judas Iscariot."

    Judas Iscariot’s name is listed last among the disciples ([Matthew 10:4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:4); [Mark 3:19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:19); [Luke 6:16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:16)). This is likely because of the shame connected with his name. It is less likely that it shows his original importance among the Twelve. During Jesus’s public ministry, he managed the treasury of the group ([John 13:29](https://ref.ly/John13:29)). He was known to steal their money ([12:6](https://ref.ly/John12:6)). Judas made a deal with the priests to deliver Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. He identified Jesus by kissing him in the garden of Gethsemane ([Matthew 26:14–47](https://ref.ly/Matt26:14-Matt26:47); [Mark 14:10–46](https://ref.ly/Mark14:10-Mark14:46); [Luke 22:3–48](https://ref.ly/Luke22:3-Luke22:48); [John 18:2–5](https://ref.ly/John18:2-John18:5)).

    People have different ideas about why Judas betrayed Jesus:

    1. Judas wanted to remove the Romans from power. When he realized Jesus did not plan to do this or to start a Jewish state, he betrayed Jesus.
        2. Judas believed Jesus was the Messiah (God's chosen leader). Judas planned Jesus's arrest in the hope of getting Jesus to start his kingdom.
        3. He was a liar who had planned evil since the start of Jesus’s public ministry.
        4. Judas was guided by Satan to betray Jesus. After recognizing that he was tricked by Satan, he took his own life because he regretted what he had done.
        5. Jesus shamed and humiliated Judas when he corrected him. Judas was originally a loyal disciple, but he turned against Jesus.
        6. Judas was moved by his greed. He gave into his own evil desires. He did not realize that Jesus would be tried and killed. When he found out Jesus had died because of him, he repented and killed himself.
        Judas was sad over his actions. He went out and hung himself in a field. He bought the field with his 30 pieces of silver ([Matthew 27:3–10](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:10)). [Acts 1:18](https://ref.ly/Acts1:18) adds the specific detail that his body split open. His intestines spilled out of his body. This is why the field was called the “Field of Blood” ([Acts 1:19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:19)). Matthias later took Judas Iscariot’s place among the Twelve ([1:26](https://ref.ly/Acts1:26)).

2. Jesus's brother Judas. He was the son of Joseph and Mary. His other brothers were James, Joseph, and Simon ([Matthew 13:55](https://ref.ly/Matt13:55); [Mark 6:3](https://ref.ly/Mark6:3)). At first, Judas and his brothers did not believe Jesus was the Messiah ([John 7:5](https://ref.ly/John7:5)). They believed after Jesus came back to life ([Acts 1:14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:14)). Many believe Judas or “Jude” authored the letter in the New Testament named Jude.
3. The son of James. He is another one of the 12 disciples ([Luke 6:16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:16); [John 14:22](https://ref.ly/John14:22); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). [Matthew 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3) and [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18) call him Thaddeus. *See* Thaddaeus, The Apostle.
4. A man from Galilee who led a Jewish revolt against the Romans. This revolt resulted from the census taken by Quirinius in AD 6\. In [Acts 5:37](https://ref.ly/Acts5:37), one of the religious leaders, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, talked about Judas as an example of one who tried but failed to get Jewish people to follow him. Josephus said Judas him started a group called the Zealots. This group wanted to remove Roman control and bring back a free Jewish kingdom (*War* 2\.8\.1\).
5. The owner of a house on a street named "Straight" in Damascus. Saul, who was later called Paul, stayed at this house after he changed his beliefs. He stayed there after a man named Ananias helped him see again ([Acts 9:11](https://ref.ly/Acts9:11)).
6. A prophet and leader in the early Jerusalem church. Judas Barsabbas was chosen with Silas to join Paul and Barnabas on their trip to Antioch. In Antioch, they told the Antioch church the Jerusalem Council's decision about the gentile church. After sharing the decision, they supported its believers there ([Acts 15:22–32](https://ref.ly/Acts15:22-Acts15:32)). *See* Joseph \#12.
7. The King James Version spelling of Judah. He is Jacob’s son ([Matthew 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:2-Matt1:3)). *See* Judah (Person) \#1.
