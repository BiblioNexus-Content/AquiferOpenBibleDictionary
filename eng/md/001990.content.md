## Feast of Tabernacles (id: 8695)

FEAST OF TABERNACLES
====================

The Feast of Tabernacles, also called the Feast of Booths, Shelters, or Ingathering, was one of the three most important festivals in Israel. It celebrated the completion of the farming year. During this festival, the Jewish people built temporary shelters called "booths" or "tabernacles" to remember how God saved them from Egypt ([Leviticus 23:33–43](https://ref.ly/Lev23:33-Lev23:43)). These temporary shelters were similar to the ones the Israelites lived in during their journey through the wilderness after leaving Egypt.
