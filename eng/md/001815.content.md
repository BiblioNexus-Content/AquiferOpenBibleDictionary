## Emim, Emites (id: 5070)

EMIM\*, EMITES
==============

Name given to the original inhabitants of Moab ([Gn 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5)) by the Moabites who ousted them from their land. They were a tall people, known also as Rephaim ([Dt 2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Deut2:10-Deut2:11)), and were compared with the Zuzites, Anakim, and Horites for their size. This phenomenon is evidently an indication of genetic isolation. *See* Giants.
