## Nahalal (id: 7280)

NAHALAL
=======

City in Zebulun’s territory ([Jos 19:15](https://ref.ly/Josh19:15)), given to the Levites for an inheritance ([21:35](https://ref.ly/Josh21:35)). Zebulun’s tribe was unable to drive the Canaanites from the city, so they forced them into hard labor ([Jgs 1:30](https://ref.ly/Judg1:30), “Nahalol”). The exact location of the city is unknown. Some possible locations include Tell el\-Beida, south of modern Nahalal, and Tell en\-Nahl, north of the Kishon River and near the southern end of the plain of Acco, near modern Nahalal.
