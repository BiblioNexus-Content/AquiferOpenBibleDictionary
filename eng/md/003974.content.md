## Mount Perazim (id: 7658)

MOUNT PERAZIM
=============

A mountain mentioned in [Isaiah 28:21](https://ref.ly/Isa28:21). It seems it was near Baal\-perazim, which means “Baal of Breaches.” Baal\-perazim is where King David defeated the Philistines. From the context of [2 Samuel 5:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:20), it appears that this battleground was in the valley of Rephaim, which is southwest of Jerusalem.
