## Abiel (id: 3293)

ABIEL
=====

1. The father of Kish and Ner and grandfather of King Saul, according to [1 Samuel 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:1) and [14:51](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51). Other lists of ancestors in 1 Chronicles list Ner, instead of Abiel, as Kish’s father and Saul’s grandfather ([1 Chronicles 8:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:33); [9:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:39)). This confusion is either because of a copyist’s error or because Saul may have had two relatives named Ner, a great\-grandfather and an uncle.
2. A warrior among David’s mighty men who were known as “the thirty” ([1 Chronicles 11:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:32)). He is also called Abi\-albon the Arbathite ([2 Samuel 23:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:31)).
