## Plants (id: 7761)

PLANTS
======

Identifying plants mentioned in the Bible has always been difficult. This is partly because people often think that plants like elm, sycamore, lily, rose, and vine in the Bible are the same as modern plants with these names. Also, people sometimes assume that all plants growing in the Holy Land today were there in biblical times. Or, people sometimes assume that all plants mentioned in the Bible can still be found there today.

Unfortunately, many plants that are common in the Holy Land today did not exist there during biblical times. On the other hand, many plants that once grew abundantly in that area are now extinct. Some plants disappeared because foreign species invaded their habitat. Others have been eliminated or nearly eliminated because of too much farming, the cutting down of forests, and the resulting changes in climate and other environmental conditions.

At one time, the region was full of palm trees. The date palm was as common and typical there as it was in Egypt. Today, the date palm is much less common in the region. Similarly, in ancient times, tall cedar trees covered the slopes of Lebanon and other mountain ranges. Now, the few remaining cedar trees must be carefully fenced in to protect them from being trampled and eaten by goats.
