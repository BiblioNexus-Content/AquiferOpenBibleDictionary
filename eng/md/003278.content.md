## Keilah (Place) (id: 6535)

KEILAH (Place)
==============

City assigned to Judah’s tribe ([Jos 15:44](https://ref.ly/Josh15:44); [1 Chr 4:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:19)), located in the southeast Shephelah near the Philistine border. It is identified with modern Khirbet Qila, eight and a half miles (13\.7 kilometers) northwest of Hebron.

David led a daring expedition to Keilah to deliver it from marauding Philistine bands, who were stealing grain from its threshing floors. He made it his residence for a time and expected to gain the loyalty of its people. However, when it became evident that the men of Keilah were plotting to turn him and his men over to Saul, he retreated into the wilderness of Ziph ([1 Sm 23:1–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:14)).

Keilah was reinhabited by Jews after the Captivity and was divided into two districts, ruled by Hashabiah and Bavvai. Its rulers were included in the roster of those who participated in rebuilding the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah ([Neh 3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Neh3:17-Neh3:18)).
