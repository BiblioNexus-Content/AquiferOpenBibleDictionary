## Bildad (id: 4238)

BILDAD
======

One of three friends who came to comfort Job in his anguish, identified as a Shuhite ([Jb 2:11](https://ref.ly/Job2:11)). That term suggests that he was a descendant of Shuah, son of Abraham and his second wife Keturah ([Gn 25:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:2)). Bildad spoke to Job on three occasions. In his first speech he asserted that God upholds the just and punishes the wicked ([Jb 8](https://ref.ly/Job8:1-Job8:22)). Job must therefore be a hypocrite to say that he is right with God. In his second speech Bildad emphasized the immediate punishment of the wicked in this life (ch [18](https://ref.ly/Job18:1-Job18:21)). Job must therefore be wicked because of his intense suffering. In his third speech Bildad proclaimed the majesty of God and called man a worm by comparison (ch [25](https://ref.ly/Job25:1-Job25:6)). He implied that Job was foolish to claim to be righteous before such a holy God.
