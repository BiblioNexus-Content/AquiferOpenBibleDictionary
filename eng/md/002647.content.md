## Hophra (id: 5896)

HOPHRA
======

Son of Psammis, ruler over Egypt from 589–570 BC during the 26th dynasty. Called Pharaoh Hophra in [Jeremiah 44:30](https://ref.ly/Jer44:30), although he is alluded to several other times during the divided kingdom period ([Jer 37:5](https://ref.ly/Jer37:5); [43:8–13](https://ref.ly/Jer43:8-Jer43:13); [Ez 29:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:1-Ezek29:3); [31:1–18](https://ref.ly/Ezek31:1-Ezek31:18)).

He came to power after the death of his father, and in 589 BC marched into Judah against Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians in order to assist Zedekiah. Apparently he retreated before superior forces, Jerusalem was overthrown in 586 ([Jer 37:5–8](https://ref.ly/Jer37:5-Jer37:8)), and Hophra was killed as prophesied ([Jer 44:30](https://ref.ly/Jer44:30)). This occurred in 566 BC, at the hands of Amasis (Ahmose II), who had usurped the throne of Egypt in 569 BC. Both Jeremiah ([Jer 43:9–13](https://ref.ly/Jer43:9-Jer43:13); [46:13–26](https://ref.ly/Jer46:13-Jer46:26)) and Ezekiel ([Ez 29–30](https://ref.ly/Ezek29:1-Ezek30:26)) foretold this defeat.
