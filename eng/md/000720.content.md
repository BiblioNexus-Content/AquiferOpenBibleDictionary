## Banish, Banishment (id: 3988)

BANISH, BANISHMENT
==================

The exclusion of a person from a country or group as a form of punishment.

In the Bible, "banishment" or similar words are used several times: 

* God’s judgment on Adam and Eve ([Genesis 3:23](https://ref.ly/Gen3:23-Gen3:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen3:23-Gen3:24)[24](https://ref.ly/Gen3:23-Gen3:24))
* God's judgment on Cain ([4:9](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9-Gen4:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9-Gen4:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9-Gen4:14))
* Absalom’s exile from his father David ([2 Samuel 13:37](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:37-2Sam13:39)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:37-2Sam13:39)[39](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:37-2Sam13:39); [14:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:13-2Sam14:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:13-2Sam14:14)[14](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:13-2Sam14:14))
* Israel’s exile from the promised land ([Deuteronomy 30:1](https://ref.ly/Deut30:1); [Isaiah 11:12](https://ref.ly/Isa11:12); [Jeremiah 16:15](https://ref.ly/Jer16:15); [Ezekiel 4:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:13))

Banishment was included in a list of punishments in the exile in Babylon for those who disobeyed God or the Persian king Artaxerxes ([Ezra 7:26](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:26))

The Mosaic law prescribed that an Israelite could be “cut off” from the community for various offenses:

* failure to circumcise a male child ([Genesis 17:12, 14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:12,Gen17:14))
* eating leavened bread during Passover ([Exodus 12:15](https://ref.ly/Exod12:15))
* making an unholy animal sacrifice ([Leviticus 17:1](https://ref.ly/Lev17:1-Lev17:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev17:1-Lev17:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Lev17:1-Lev17:4))
* eating blood ([Leviticus 17:10](https://ref.ly/Lev17:10))
* sinning deliberately ([Numbers 15:30](https://ref.ly/Num15:30-Num15:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Num15:30-Num15:31)[31](https://ref.ly/Num15:30-Num15:31))
* failing to undergo ceremonial cleansing after contact with a dead body ([Numbers 19:11](https://ref.ly/Num19:11-Num19:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Num19:11-Num19:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Num19:11-Num19:20))

Being “cut off” likely meant exclusion from both social and religious life ([John 9:18](https://ref.ly/John9:18-John9:23,John9:34)[–](https://ref.ly/John9:18-John9:23)[23, 34](https://ref.ly/John9:18-John9:23,John9:34)). After the exile, when the nation of Israel was banished, disinheritance and permanent excommunication from God’s people became formal punishments ([Ezra 10:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:7-Ezra10:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:7-Ezra10:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:7-Ezra10:8)). 

The Romans, like other conquerors, used deportation as a form of punishment. For example, Jews were banished from Rome under Emperor Claudius due to controversies ([Acts 18:2](https://ref.ly/Acts18:2)). The author of Revelation was exiled to the island of Patmos during Roman persecution ([Revelation 1:9](https://ref.ly/Rev1:9)). More severe forms of banishment included permanent exclusion from a region, loss of citizenship, and confiscation of property.
