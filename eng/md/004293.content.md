## Pahath-Moab (id: 7551)

PAHATH\-MOAB
============

Head of a family of Israelites who returned with Zerubbabel to Palestine after the Babylonian captivity ([Ezr 2:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:6); [Neh 7:11](https://ref.ly/Neh7:11)). Other members of his family, about 200 men, came with Ezra ([Ezr 8:4](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:4)). After the return, certain of his sons were included among the Israelites who vowed to sever their relationships with foreign wives ([10:30](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:30)). Hasshub, Pahath\-moab’s son, helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall and the tower of furnaces in Nehemiah’s day ([Neh 3:11](https://ref.ly/Neh3:11)). Pahath\-moab, called a chief of the people, set his seal on Ezra’s covenant ([10:14](https://ref.ly/Neh10:14)).
