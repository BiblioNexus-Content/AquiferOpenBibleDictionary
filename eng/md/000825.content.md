## Bema (id: 4096)

BEMA
====

A Greek word for a judgment seat or court of a Roman official. This word, which literally means "step" or "stride," was commonly used in the first century AD to refer to a raised platform where political speeches or judicial decisions were made. The bema was an important feature in ancient cities, often located in important public areas such as marketplaces.

In the New Testament, the word is used several times:

* Jesus was questioned before the judgment seat of Pilate ([Matthew 27:19](https://ref.ly/Matt27:19); [John 19:13](https://ref.ly/John19:13)).
* Herod Agrippa I addressed the people of Tyre and Sidon from a judgment seat ([Acts 12:21](https://ref.ly/Acts12:21)).
* The apostle Paul was brought before the judgement seat of Gallio in Corinth ([Acts 18:12](https://ref.ly/Acts18:12-Acts18:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts18:12-Acts18:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Acts18:12-Acts18:17)).
* The apostle Paul was again brought before Festus’s judgement seat in Caesarea ([Acts 25:6, 10, 17](https://ref.ly/Acts25:6,Acts25:10,Acts25:17)).
* Paul used the word to refer to God’s judgment seat

    + In [Romans 14:10,](https://ref.ly/Rom14:10) he warned that all will stand before the judgment seat of God.
        + According to [2 Corinthians 5:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:10), Paul described the judgment seat of Christ, where the value of each person's work will be judged (compare [1 Corinthians 3:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13-1Cor3:15)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13-1Cor3:15)[15](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13-1Cor3:15)).
