## Cricket (id: 4692)

CRICKET
=======

A winged insect with four legs (from the scientific family *Orthptera)*. These insects are related to grasshoppers and locusts. Israelites considered crickets ceremonially clean to eat ([Leviticus 11:22](https://ref.ly/Lev11:22)). The reference in the Bible may actually be describing one of the growth stages of the locust, rather than what we call crickets today.
