## Evil-Merodach (id: 5195)

EVIL\-MERODACH
==============

Son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar as king of Babylon, who reigned for two years (561–560 BC). During his reign, he released Jehoiachin, former king of Judah, from imprisonment ([2 Kgs 25:27–30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:27-2Kgs25:30); [Jer 52:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer52:31-Jer52:34)). Aside from this fact, little is known about his reign. He was killed by his brother\-in\-law Neriglissar, who succeeded him to the throne. *See* Babylon, Babylonia.
