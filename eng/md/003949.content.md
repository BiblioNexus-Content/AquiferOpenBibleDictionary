## Morning Star (id: 7208)

MORNING STAR
============

Another name for the planet Venus. This term is closely linked to the ideas of "dayspring" ([Job 38:12](https://ref.ly/Job38:12); [Luke 1:78](https://ref.ly/Luke1:78)) and "daystar" ([2 Peter 1:19](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:19)). Jesus confirms he is the Morning Star when he says, "I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star" ([Revelation 22:16](https://ref.ly/Rev22:16)).

This statement is similar to Jesus saying, "I am the light of the world" ([John 8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5); [12:46](https://ref.ly/John12:46)). The main idea behind this symbol is Christ as a light shining in darkness ([Luke 2:32](https://ref.ly/Luke2:32); [John 1:4](https://ref.ly/John1:4), [7–9](https://ref.ly/John1:7-John1:9); [3:19](https://ref.ly/John3:19); [12:35](https://ref.ly/John12:35); [2 Corinthians 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:6); [Ephesians 5:14](https://ref.ly/Eph5:14); [1 Peter 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9); [1 John 2:8](https://ref.ly/1John2:8); [Revelation 21:23](https://ref.ly/Rev21:23)).

When the Messiah (Jesus) was born, it was like the morning star rising. This event marked the start of the gospel light spreading ([Isaiah 9:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa9:1-Isa9:2); [Matthew 4:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:15-Matt4:16)). The phrase "Morning Star" points to two things about Christ:

1. His glory as the source of light
2. His grace in sharing life with others

Jesus not only called himself the Morning Star, but he also said he gives the Morning Star to those who overcome ([Revelation 2:28](https://ref.ly/Rev2:28)).
