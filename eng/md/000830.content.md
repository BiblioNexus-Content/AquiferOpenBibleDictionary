## Benaiah (id: 4098)

BENAIAH
=======

A popular name meaning “the Lord has built,” used primarily by Levites.

1. The son of Jehoiada the priest, from the south Judean town of Kabzeel. Benaiah fought in the military, and he became the commander\-in\-chief of the army during the reign of Solomon ([1 Kings 2:35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:35); [4:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:4)).

    Before David became king, Benaiah performed a number of daring military and protective feats to become one of the mighty men ([2 Samuel 23:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22)[22](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20-2Sam23:22)) during David’s flight from King Saul. He became the commander of “the thirty” ([1 Chronicles 27:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:6)), a group second only to “the three” of highest valor ([2 Samuel 23:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:23)). He later had a high place in the armed forces when Joab was commander in chief and led King David’s elite troops, the Cherethites and Pelethites ([2 Samuel 8:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:18)). He was made third in command by David, with 24,000 men under him. His duties included annual priestly service in the temple ([1 Chronicles 27:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:5-1Chr27:6)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:5-1Chr27:6)[6](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:5-1Chr27:6)).

    Benaiah stayed loyal to David during the rebellion of Absalom ([2 Samuel 20:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:23); see [2 Samuel 15:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:18)). He was also loyal during the attempt by Adonijah to take David’s throne ([1 Kings 1:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:8)). For this, he was rewarded with the opportunity to help in Solomon’s coronation at Gihon ([1 Kings 1:32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:32-1Kgs1:40)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:32-1Kgs1:40)[40](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:32-1Kgs1:40)). As army commander and chief bodyguard to Solomon, he executed Adonijah ([1 Kings 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:25)), Joab (verse [34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:34)), and Shimei (verse [46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:46)).

Afterward, he was appointed to serve daily before the ark under Asaph's direction ([1 Chronicles 16:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5)).
5. A priestly musician who blew the trumpet before the ark when King David brought it to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 15:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:24)). Afterward he was appointed to play regularly before the ark ([1 Chronicles 16:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:6)).
6. The father of Jehoiada, King David’s counselor after the death of Ahithophel ([1 Chronicles 27:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:34); see also [2 Samuel 17:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:1-2Sam17:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:1-2Sam17:14)[14](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:1-2Sam17:14)).
