## Amasa (id: 3543)

AMASA
=====

1. Son of Ithra (Jether) and David’s sister Abigail ([2 Samuel 17:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:25); [1 Chronicles 2:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:17)). He was, therefore, David’s nephew. Amasa was a captain who supported Absalom in his rebellion against his father, David. After David's general Joab killed Absalom, David pardoned Amasa and replaced Joab with him ([2 Samuel 19:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:13)). This greatly offended Joab. He awaited his revenge. When given the opportunity, he killed his unsuspecting rival ([2 Samuel 20:4–13](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:4-2Sam20:13)). David could not punish Joab but instructed his son Solomon to see that Joab was executed for murdering Amasa and another of David’s generals ([1 Kings 2:5–6, 28–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6,1Kgs2:28-1Kgs2:34)).
2. Hadlai’s son from Ephraim’s tribe. Amasa supported the prophet Oded. Oded opposed making slaves of women and children captured from the southern kingdom of Judah in the time of King Ahaz ([2 Chronicles 28:8–13](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:8-2Chr28:13)).
