## Bezek (id: 4221)

BEZEK
=====

1. A site of a major victory for the tribes of Simeon and Judah over the Perizzites and Canaanites ([Judges 1:3](https://ref.ly/Judg1:3-Judg1:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg1:3-Judg1:7)[7](https://ref.ly/Judg1:3-Judg1:7)). Adoni\-bezek, which means “lord of Bezek,” was king of the city at that time. Bezek was perhaps located at Khirbet Bezqa, a few miles northwest of Jerusalem.
2. A place where Saul gathered an army to attack the Ammonites who were troubling Jabesh\-gilead ([1 Samuel 11:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:8-1Sam11:11)[–](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:8-1Sam11:11)[11](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:8-1Sam11:11)). This Bezek is usually located at Khirbet Ibziq, a little south of Mount Gilboa.
