## Zarephath (id: 9142)

ZAREPHATH
=========

A village where the woman who provided food and lodging for Elijah lived ([1 Kings 17:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:9-1Kgs17:10)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:9-1Kgs17:10)[10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:9-1Kgs17:10); [Luke 4:26](https://ref.ly/Luke4:26)). Obadiah later prophesied that the Israelite exiles of Halah would “possess the land of the Canaanites as far as Zarephath” ([Obadiah 1:20](https://ref.ly/Obad1:20)). Zarephath was under the control of Sidon at the time Elijah visited, thus serving as a safe haven from King Ahab of Israel. Zarephath is likely the modern Surafend, where a chapel marks the traditional site for the widow’s house.
