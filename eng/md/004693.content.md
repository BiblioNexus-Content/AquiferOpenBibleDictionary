## Razor (id: 7955)

RAZOR
=====

A sharp tool used for shaving off the beard or hair ([Nm 8:7](https://ref.ly/Num8:7); [Ez 5:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek5:1)). Use of the razor was proscribed for those under the Nazirite vow ([Nm 6:5](https://ref.ly/Num6:5); [1 Sm 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11)). The instrument played a central role in Samson’s life ([Jgs 13:5](https://ref.ly/Judg13:5); [16:17](https://ref.ly/Judg16:17)).

The razor is a simile for a slanderous tongue ([Ps 52:2](https://ref.ly/Ps52:2)) and a metaphor for judgment ([Is 7:20](https://ref.ly/Isa7:20)).
