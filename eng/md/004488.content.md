PISTACHIO
=========

The "pistachios" mentioned in [Genesis 43:11](https://ref.ly/Gen43:11) are probably pistachio nuts from the pistachio tree *(Pistacia vera),* which is closely related to the terebinth. The pistachio tree grows to a height of 3 to 9\.1 meters (10 to 30 feet) with a spreading top. This tree can be found growing wild in many rocky areas of Lebanon and Israel and the surrounding areas. The pistachio nut has a light\-colored shell, and the kernel inside has a sweet, delicate flavor that people enjoy wherever the tree grows.

*See* Food and Food Preparation, Terebinth.
