## Ashurite (id: 3813)

ASHURITE
========

This is probably a different way to spell Asherite, a member of the tribe of Asher. The Ashurites supported Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, instead of David as king over Israel after Saul’s death ([2 Samuel 2:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9)). In [Ezekiel 27:6,](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:6) the Hebrew word refers to a kind of wood rather than a group of people.
