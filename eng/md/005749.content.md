## Valley of Gad (id: 5344)

VALLEY OF GAD
=============

The Valley of Gad is a place mentioned in [2 Samuel 24:5\.](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:5) The name means "the river or streambed of Gad" in Hebrew. Different Bible translations describe this location in various ways:

* "In the midst of the river of Gad" (King James Version)
* "In the middle of the valley, toward Gad" (Revised Standard Version)
* "The valley of Gad" (American Standard Version)
* "In the direction of Gad" (New Living Translation)

This valley was the starting point for King David's census of the Israelites. Most scholars believe the "river" or "valley" refers to the Arnon River, an important waterway in the region.
