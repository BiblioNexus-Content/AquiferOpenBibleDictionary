## Moreh, Hill of (id: 7202)

MOREH, Hill of
==============

Hill close to the valley of Jezreel, near which the Midianites camped when they were attacked by Gideon ([Jgs 7:1](https://ref.ly/Judg7:1)). It was probably called by this name because it was the location of a sanctuary where divination was practiced. Its name may imply instruction or divination. It is generally identified with Jebel Nabi Dahi, across the valley from Mt Gilboa.
