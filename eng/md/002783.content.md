## Intercession of Christ (id: 6035)

INTERCESSION OF CHRIST
======================

The theological term for Jesus Christ’s work of asking God the Father to save, help, and support people on earth.

The Hebrew word for "intercession" comes from a root meaning "to strike," which suggests the idea of making a strong request. This word is used in a prophecy about the “servant of the Lord” in Isaiah: “He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors” ([Isaiah 53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:12)). In Greek, the word for intercession originally meant to "meet," "approach," or "appeal." During the period between the Old and New Testaments, this word was used to describe personally asking an official for a favor (as seen in [2 Maccabees 4:8](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:8)). In the New Testament, the noun form is translated both as "intercession" ([1 Timothy 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:1)) and as "prayer" ([1 Timothy 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:5)).

Theologians see Christ’s intercession as the second part of his priestly work. His suffering and death on the cross were the first part. This fixed the problem of human wrongdoing (sin) and made things right between God and people again ([1 Timothy 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5-1Tim2:6)). In the Old Testament, priests prayed for the people. On the Day of Atonement, the high priest entered the holy of holies with the sin offering's blood. He then made the place holy with incense and sprinkled blood on the"mercy seat" ([Leviticus 16:11–19](https://ref.ly/Lev16:11-Lev16:19)). After Jesus died for sins, He went to the Father and entered heaven, where he now represents his people ([Hebrews 7:25](https://ref.ly/Heb7:25)).

Christ’s Intercession on Earth
------------------------------

Before beginning his life of intercession in heaven, Jesus Christ prayed and interceded for people on earth. This matched his teaching that his followers should always pray and not become discouraged ("lose heart, [Luke 18:1](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1)). The Bible often shows Jesus praying. For example, he prayed at the grave of his friend Lazarus ([John 11:41–42](https://ref.ly/John11:41-John11:42)). He spent all night in prayer on a mountain before choosing the twelve apostles ([Luke 6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Luke6:12-Luke6:13)). After warning his disciple Peter that Satan wanted to test him, Jesus said to Peter, “I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail” ([Luke 22:32](https://ref.ly/Luke22:32)). Jesus’s first words on the cross were a prayer for those who persecuted him ([Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)).

The "high priestly prayer" in [John 17](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:26) is the most complete example of an intercessory prayer by Jesus in the Bible. This prayer is based on his close relationship with his Father ([John 17:5, 8](https://ref.ly/John17:5)). Jesus prays for three things: 

1. For himself, asking that he might glorify the Father and finish the work he was sent to do ([John 17:1–5](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:5))
2. For his disciples, who were chosen to spread the gospel after he was gone ([John 17:8–9](https://ref.ly/John17:8-John17:9))
3. For all believers ([John 17:20](https://ref.ly/John17:20))

The goals of his intercession include: 

1. The unity of God’s people ([John 17:11, 21](https://ref.ly/John17:11))
2. Their joy despite hardships ([John 17:13](https://ref.ly/John17:13))
3. Their protection from evil ([John 17:15](https://ref.ly/John17:15))
4. Their sanctification by God’s Word ([John 17:17](https://ref.ly/John17:17))
5. Their eternal fellowship with Christ ([John 17:24](https://ref.ly/John17:24))

Christ’s Intercession in Heaven
-------------------------------

Christ’s intercession for his people, which began on earth, continues in heaven. The Book of Hebrews describes Christ as a priest and focuses on his ongoing ministry of intercession. His heavenly intercession follows his earthly sacrifice, which was completed “once for all” ([Hebrews 10:10–18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:10-Heb10:18)). Jesus himself said, “Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven” ([Matthew 10:32](https://ref.ly/Matt10:32)). This ongoing intercession is recognized in New Testament phrases like “through Jesus Christ” ([Romans 1:8](https://ref.ly/Rom1:8); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Rom16:27); [1 Peter 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:5)), “through him” ([Colossians 3:17](https://ref.ly/Col3:17); [Hebrews 13:15](https://ref.ly/Heb13:15)), and “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” ([Ephesians 5:20](https://ref.ly/Eph5:20)).

The New Testament explicitly affirms the doctrine of Christ’s heavenly intercession in four key passages. The apostle Paul says that Christ is “at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us” ([Romans 8:34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:34)). The writer of Hebrews states that Christ “is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him since he always lives to make intercession for them” ([Hebrews 7:25](https://ref.ly/Heb7:25)). Further, Christ has entered “into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf” ([Hebrews 9:24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24)). The apostle John also describes this ministry: “If anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” ([1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)). The Greek word for “advocate” refers to a legal counselor who represents a client’s cause before a judge. John thus presents the risen Lord as appearing before God on behalf of his people, offering his own obedience and suffering as the reason for their forgiveness.

How Does Intercession Work?
---------------------------

Christ's intercession in heaven has two aspects. It is both complete and ongoing. His redemptive work is finished. But, he continues to care for God's people. His intercession includes:

1. His presence with the Father as the basis for each believer’s justification ([Hebrews 9:24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24))
2. His stopping Satan’s accusations against each believer ([Romans 8:33](https://ref.ly/Rom8:33); [Revelation 12:10](https://ref.ly/Rev12:10))
3. His claiming each believer’s right to come into God’s presence ([Hebrews 4:14–16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16))
4. His mediating the prayers of each believer

In response, God the Father gives believers many spiritual blessings.

John Owen, a Puritan who lived from 1616 to 1683, said, “The intercession of Christ… is his continual appearance for us in the presence of God, representing the power of his sacrifice, along with his tender care, love, and desire for the well\-being, support, deliverance, and salvation of the church.”

The Bible describes the people for whom Christ intercedes in both broad and narrow terms. Christ is said to pray for all people everywhere ([Isaiah 53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:12); compare [Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28)). More specifically, He prays for his redeemed community, the church ([John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16); [17:9, 20](https://ref.ly/John17:9); [Hebrews 4:15–16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:15-Heb4:16)). Yet Christ’s prayers are also focused on the specific needs of individual believers ([Luke 22:31–32](https://ref.ly/Luke22:31-Luke22:32); [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)).
