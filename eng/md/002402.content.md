## Hara (id: 5661)

HARA
====

Place where Tiglath\-pileser of Assyria exiled Reuben, Gad, and the half\-tribe of Manasseh ([1 Chr 5:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:26)). A possible miscopying of [2 Kings 17:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:6) and [18:11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:11) may have substituted Hara for “cities of Media.” The Greek version reads “mountains of Media,” indicating an area east of the Tigris Valley. A district rather than a single site seems to be indicated.
