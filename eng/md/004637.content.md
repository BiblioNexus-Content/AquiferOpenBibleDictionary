## Raca (id: 7901)

RACA
====

A derogatory expression used by Jews of the first century AD to show open contempt for another. *Raca* is derived from an Aramaic and Hebrew term meaning “empty” or “worthless.” Raca means "empty\-headed." It likely insults one's intellect, not morals. 

In the Old Testament, it is comparable to: 

* The worthless lot that Abimelech hired to follow him ([Judges 9:4](https://ref.ly/Judg9:4))
* The idle men who gathered around Jephthah ([Judges 11:3](https://ref.ly/Judg11:3))
* The scoundrels who joined Jeroboam ([2 Chronicles 13:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:7))

Michal accused David of acting like a vulgar fellow \[*raca*] who shamelessly exposed himself ([2 Samuel 6:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:20)). Rabbinic literature used this term to describe an immoral, untrained person.

Jesus warned against calling a brother *“Raca!”* ([Matthew 5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22)). Jesus said to judge the insulter and punish them with the highest penalty. The commandment against murder ([Exodus 20:13](https://ref.ly/Exod20:13)) banned the act, angry thoughts, and contempt.
