## Horesh (id: 5901)

HORESH
======

Hebrew word translated as a place\-name in [1 Samuel 23:15–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:15-1Sam23:19) (part of the wilderness of Ziph). David hid from Saul there, and met secretly with Jonathan. The word is translated simply as “wooded areas” in [2 Chronicles 27:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:4) (nlt). Authorities differ on whether the place\-name in 1 Samuel is warranted.

* **Associated Passages:** 2CH 27:4; 1SA 23:15–1SA 23:19
