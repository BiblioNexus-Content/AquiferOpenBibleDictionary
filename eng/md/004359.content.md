## Pavilion (id: 7618)

PAVILION
========

The English word pavilion is sometimes used in older Bible translations to describe a shelter or covering. It often translates two Hebrew words: *sukkah* and *sokoh*. These words refer to simple shelters like a booth, tent, hut, or den.

The word *sukkah* is also translated as “shelters” ([Genesis 33:17](https://ref.ly/Gen33:17)), “tabernacles” ([Leviticus 23:34](https://ref.ly/Lev23:34)), and “tents” ([2 Samuel 11:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:11)). Other translations of *sokoh* are “thicket” ([Psalm 10:9](https://ref.ly/Ps10:9)), “tent” ([76:2](https://ref.ly/Ps76:2)), and “den” ([Jeremiah 25:38](https://ref.ly/Jer25:38)).

In [1 Kings 20:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:16), some English Bibles use the word “pavilions” to describe the tents of King Ben\-hadad and his officials. They were drinking in their tents when King Ahab attacked them. Other translations use “booths,” “temporary shelters,” “quarters,” or simply “tents.”

The book of Psalms also uses the idea of a pavilion in a poetic way. In [Psalms 27:5](https://ref.ly/Ps27:5) and [31:20](https://ref.ly/Ps31:20), the writer says that the Lord gives special protection. This protection is like a shelter where people can hide from danger. [Psalm 18:11](https://ref.ly/Ps18:11) says, “He made darkness His hiding place, and storm clouds a canopy around Him.” This verse uses picture language to describe how God hides his presence in dark clouds.
