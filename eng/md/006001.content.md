## Ziz, Ascent of (id: 9247)

ZIZ, Ascent of
==============

Mountain pass going up from the Dead Sea to the Judean highlands. This ascent was the route used by the Ammonites and the Moabites prior to their defeat by Jehoshaphat as prophesied by Jehaziel ([2 Chr 20:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:16)). It is likely that Ziz should be identified with Ain Jidy, a pass that still provides an important route from the Dead Sea into the Judean interior.
