## Eli (id: 5032)

ELI
===

A priest in the sanctuary of the Lord at Shiloh during the time of the judges ([1 Samuel 1:3, 9](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:3,1Sam1:9)). Shiloh was a sacred place located about 16 kilometers (10 miles) north of Jerusalem. It was the main worship center for the Israelite tribes. Eli had two sons named Hophni and Phinehas who were also priests. These are Egyptian names. The Bible does not clearly state Eli's family line, but there are two possibilities:

* He may have been a descendant of Ithamar, Aaron's younger son ([1 Samuel 22:20](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:20); [1 Kings 2:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:27); [1 Chronicles 24:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3)).
* He may have come from the family of Eleazar ([Exodus 6:23–25](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23-Exod6:25); [2 Esdras 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:2-2Esd1:3)).

In [1 Samuel 1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:28), Eli blessed Hannah, the childless wife of Elkanah, after he learned about her prayer for a son. Later, Hannah gave birth to Samuel. When Samuel was old enough to be weaned, his mother brought him to Eli for training in the sanctuary, keeping the promise she had made to God.

Hophni and Phinehas were leading the Israelites into sinful ways despite Eli's objections. Because of this sin, God promised to punish Eli's family ([1 Samuel 2:27, 36](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:27,1Sam2:36)). God said that Eli's sons would die on the same day ([1 Samule 2:34](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:34)). This happened during a battle with the Philistines at Aphek ([1 Samuel 4:11, 17](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:11,1Sam4:17)). Eli also died when he heard about the defeat and that the Philistines had captured the ark of the covenant. Eli was 98 years old when he died. He had been both a priest and a judge in Israel for 40 years ([1 Samuel 4:15–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:15-1Sam4:18)). Eli's daughter\-in\-law, the wife of Phinehas, died while giving birth. She was heartbroken over the loss of her husband and the ark. She named her son Ichabod because she felt there was no more hope ([1 Samuel 4:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:19-1Sam4:22)).

Eli was sincere and devoted to God, but he was not a strong leader. He was weak and too lenient with his sons.
