## Shimeathite (id: 8403)

SHIMEATHITE
===========

One of three families of scribes living at Jabez in Judah. They were perhaps Kenites and descendants of Hammath ([1 Chr 2:55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:55)). Their history is not certain. The Shimeathites may be identified with one of the nomadic Kenite tribes that settled with the Amalekites in southern Palestine during Saul’s reign in Israel (1020–1000 BC).
