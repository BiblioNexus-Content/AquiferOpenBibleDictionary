## Memucan (id: 7043)

MEMUCAN
=======

One of the seven princes of Persia and Media under King Ahasuerus ([Esther 1:14–21](https://ref.ly/Esth1:14-Esth1:21)). He brought charges against Vashti, the Persian queen, for refusing to appear as the king commanded ([Esther 1:16](https://ref.ly/Esth1:16)). Memucan proposed to remove her and make someone else queen. The king listened to what Memucan said and issued a decree to find a new queen ([Esther 1:21](https://ref.ly/Esth1:21)). Esther was chosen as queen over Media and Persia.
