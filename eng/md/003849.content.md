## Micaiah (id: 7107)

MICAIAH
=======

1\. Prophet and Imlah’s son, called by Ahab to forecast the result of projected battles against the Syrians. At first Micaiah mocks him with glad news, then tells the cruel truth. Ahab casts the prophet into prison as a kind of ransom, but the wicked ruler dies in battle, just as Micaiah predicted ([1 Kgs 22:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:8); [2 Chr 18:7–25](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:7-2Chr18:25)).

2\. Father of Acbor, one of the court officials whom King Josiah sent to the prophetess Huldah to get an opinion on the Book of the Law that Hilkiah the high priest had found in the temple ([2 Kgs 22:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:12); [2 Chr 34:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:20), “Abdon, son of Micah”).

3\. Alternate rendering of Maacah, mother of Judah’s King Abijah, in [2 Chronicles 13:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:2). *See* Maacah, Maachah (Person) \#4.

4\. Teacher commissioned by King Jehoshaphat to teach the law of the Lord throughout Judah ([2 Chr 17:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7)).

5\. Alternate spelling of Mica, Zicri’s son, in [Nehemiah 12:35](https://ref.ly/Neh12:35). *See* Mica \#2.

6\. Priest who blew a trumpet at the dedication of the Jerusalem wall ([Neh 12:41](https://ref.ly/Neh12:41)).

7\. Gemariah’s son, who reported the words of the Lord to Jewish princes during the reign of King Jehoiakim ([Jer 36:11–13](https://ref.ly/Jer36:11-Jer36:13)).
