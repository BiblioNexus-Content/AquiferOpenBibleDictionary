## Karkor (id: 6522)

KARKOR
======

City in the Transjordan where Gideon attacked the armies of the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna ([Jgs 8:10](https://ref.ly/Judg8:10)). Indications of its location are sketchy. [Judges 8:11](https://ref.ly/Judg8:11) places it east of Nobah and Jog\-behah, a town identified with Jubeiah, which is seven miles (11\.3 kilometers) northwest of Amman in Jordan. A more feasible site is in the vicinity of ancient Succoth (Tell Dier ‘Alla) and Penuel (Tell edh\-Dhahab esh\-Sherqiyeh), both assigned to Gad’s tribe in Gilead.
