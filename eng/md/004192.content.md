We know almost nothing about Obadiah the prophet. The superscription ([Obadiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1)) does not mention his father's name or where he is from.

Background
----------

Obadiah likely came from Judah because he shows deep concern about the Edomites invading his land during Judah's destruction ([Obadiah 1:12](https://ref.ly/Obad1:12)). He probably had his vision about Edom ([Obadiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1)) just before Jerusalem fell and Nebuchadnezzar devastated Judah in 586 BC. Although there is no certain evidence, Nebuchadnezzar might have invaded Edom in 582 BC. The Babylonian king Nabonidus stayed in Teima for several years, and the town of Tell el Kheleifeh near the Gulf of Aqaba thrived early in the century. However, Edom declined in the sixth century BC due to interference from trading partners in Arabia and the south, like Teima and Dedan.

Content
-------

The prophet announces Edom's fall ([Obadiah 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1-Obad1:4)). A group of nearby Arab tribes planned to attack Edom, which strengthened his message ([Obadiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Obad1:1)). These tribes did not realize their attack on Edom was part of a divine plan.

The destruction of Edom is announced ([Obadiah 1:2–9](https://ref.ly/Obad1:2-Obad1:9)) and its downfall is described ([Obadiah 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Obad1:2-Obad1:4)). Edom, which seemed strong and safe in its rocky mountain fortress ([Obadiah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Obad1:3)), would be humbled ([1:4](https://ref.ly/Obad1:4)). Edom's defeat would be total ([Obadiah 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/Obad1:5-Obad1:6)). Just as thieves and raiders attack at night, Edom would be stripped, with its houses and vineyards looted. Edom would not receive any mercy, unlike when robbers sometimes spare a house. Even allies would betray Edom ([Obadiah 1:7](https://ref.ly/Obad1:7)), partners would deceive, and guests would set traps. Caught off guard, Edom would become easy prey. On the day of Edom's doom, the wise would perish ([Obadiah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Obad1:8)) and soldiers would be demoralized and killed ([Obadiah 1:9](https://ref.ly/Obad1:9)).

Edom's wrongdoing is detailed in [Obadiah 1:10–15](https://ref.ly/Obad1:10-Obad1:15). Edom showed hostility toward Judah when the Babylonians attacked. Instead of helping, Edom stayed distant and acted like an enemy. Worse, Edom celebrated Judah's misfortune, mocked the people, and took their property. Edom worked with Babylon, blocking Judah's refugees from escaping and handing them over to enemies. These actions would bring consequences to Edom.

On the Day of the Lord ([Obadiah 1:15–21](https://ref.ly/Obad1:15-Obad1:21)), guilty Edom would face God's judgment along with all nations. After the disaster that Jerusalem faced in 586 BC, another day would come. This day would bring justice and judgment in favor of Israel.

On a positive note, the remnant of Judah ([Obadiah 1:17, 21](https://ref.ly/Obad1:17,Obad1:21)) would survive. The sacred site, Mount Zion, would be restored. The Edomites would fall under the control of the remnant of Israel. Like a fire, Israel would consume the remains of Edom ([Obadiah 1:18](https://ref.ly/Obad1:18)) and reclaim lost territories ([Obadiah 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Obad1:19-Obad1:20)).

Theological Significance
------------------------

The prophecy emphasizes God's control during Judah's loss of power. God shapes events in the past and present. In the future, He will judge Israel's enemies. Zion will become the proud capital of a glorious nation, free from pagan influence forever.
