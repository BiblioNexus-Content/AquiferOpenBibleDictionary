## Palace of the Forest of Lebanon (id: 7553)

PALACE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON
===============================

Name for Solomon’s palace in Jerusalem, adjacent to the temple, given this designation because of the amount of Lebanese cedar used in its construction. The structure was about 150 feet (45\.7 meters) long, 75 feet (22\.9 meters) wide, and 45 feet (13\.7 meters) high ([1 Kgs 7:2–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:2-1Kgs7:5)). Three hundred gold shields were made to decorate it, and all the vessels of the house were made of gold. A large ivory throne overlaid with gold was constructed and placed within the palace ([2 Chr 9:16–20](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:16-2Chr9:20)). Besides providing housing and a formal palace for Solomon, it was also used to store arms ([Is 22:8](https://ref.ly/Isa22:8)).
