## Parousia (id: 7589)

PAROUSIA
========

The spelling of a Greek word meaning “presence,” “arrival,” “appearance,” or “coming.” While it is used often with reference to people ([1 Corinthians 16:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:17); [2 Corinthians 7:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor7:6); [10:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:10); [Philippians 1:26](https://ref.ly/Phil1:26); [2:12](https://ref.ly/Phil2:12)) and once with reference to the Antichrist ([2 Thessalonians 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:9)), the word is mostly used to refer to Christ ([Matthew 24:3, 27, 37](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3,Matt24:27,Matt24:37-Matt24:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3)[39](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3,Matt24:27,Matt24:37-Matt24:39); [1 Corinthians 15:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23); [1 Thessalonians 2:19](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:19); [3:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:13); [4:15](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:15); [5:23](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:23); [2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1,2Thess2:8)). So, the Parousia has come to denote the second coming of Christ at the end of the ages.

Paul was probably responsible for the technical emphasis on Christ’s return. He discouraged trying to calculate the time ([1 Thessalonians 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:2)[–](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:2)[2](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:2); [2 Thessalonians 2:2](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2-2Thess2:3)[–](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2-2Thess2:3)[3](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2-2Thess2:3); compare [Matthew 24:4](https://ref.ly/Matt24:4-Matt24:36)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:4-Matt24:36)[36](https://ref.ly/Matt24:4-Matt24:36)). Still, he paints a vivid picture of the Parousia ([1 Thessalonians 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)[–](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)[18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18); [2 Thessalonians 1:7–2:8](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:7-2Thess2:8); see also [1 Corinthians 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28,1Cor15:50-1Cor15:55)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28)[28, 50](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28,1Cor15:50-1Cor15:55)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28)[55](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:28,1Cor15:50-1Cor15:55)). 

He teaches that it will be a personal, visible, sudden, and glorious coming ([1 Corinthians 15:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23); [1 Thessalonians 2:19](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:19); [3:13](https://ref.ly/1Thess3:13); [4:15](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:15-1Thess4:17)[–](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:15-1Thess4:17)[17](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:15-1Thess4:17)). He apparently felt he and his readers would experience Christ’s return ([1 Thessalonians 4:15](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:15); compare [Romans 8:23](https://ref.ly/Rom8:23); [13:11](https://ref.ly/Rom13:11)). However, he changed his mind when confronted with his martyrdom ([Philippians 1:23](https://ref.ly/Phil1:23)). 

James, also sensing the delay in Christ’s return, called for patience ([James 5:7](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7-Jas5:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7-Jas5:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7-Jas5:8)). Peter, too, cautioned against allowing the delay to create doubt ([2 Peter 3:8](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8-2Pet3:10)[–](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8-2Pet3:10)[10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8-2Pet3:10)). The message is not a myth ([2 Peter 1:16](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:16)), and doubters will be silenced ([2 Peter 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:3-2Pet3:4)[–](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:3-2Pet3:4)[4](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:3-2Pet3:4)). John encouraged consistent faith so the coming would not put believers to shame ([1 John 2:28](https://ref.ly/1John2:28)).
