## Parapet (id: 7581)

PARAPET\*
=========

Protective barrier around the circumference of house roofs. The parapet was required by the Law ([Dt 22:8](https://ref.ly/Deut22:8)) since flat roofs were widely used ([Jos 2:6](https://ref.ly/Josh2:6); [Jgs 16:27](https://ref.ly/Judg16:27); [1 Sm 9:25](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:25); [Is 22:1](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1)). Construction of a parapet would relieve the dweller from liability should a person fall from the roof.
