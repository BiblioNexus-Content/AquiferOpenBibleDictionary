A star is a large ball of burning gas in space that gives off light. Many stars can be seen in the night sky.

The Bible sometimes uses “star” in a symbolic way. For example, stars can represent angels or leaders ([Numbers 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17); [Revelation 1:20](https://ref.ly/Rev1:20)).
