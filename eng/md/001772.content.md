ELISHAMA
========

1. The son of Ammihud. He was the leader of the tribe of Ephraim when the Israelites began their journey through the wilderness ([Numbers 1:10](https://ref.ly/Num1:10); [2:18](https://ref.ly/Num2:18); [7:48, 53](https://ref.ly/Num7:48,Num7:53)). His tribe was ninth in line during the march ([10:22](https://ref.ly/Num10:22)). Elishama was the father of Nun and grandfather of Joshua ([1 Chronicles 7:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:26)).
2. One of the 13 sons of Davidborn to King David in Jerusalem. His mother was one of David’s wives ([2 Samuel 5:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:16); [1 Chronicles 3:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:8); [14:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:7)).
3. An ancestor of Ishmael. Ishmael killed Gedaliah. Gedaliah was the governor of Israel appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kings 25:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:25); [Jeremiah 41:1](https://ref.ly/Jer41:1)).
4. A man from the tribe of Judah. He was a descendent of Jerahmeel and Sheshan ([1 Chronicles 2:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:41)).
5. Another son of David ([1 Chronicles 3:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:6)). In other passages, he is called Elishua ([2 Samuel 5:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:15) and [1 Chronicles 14:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:5)).
