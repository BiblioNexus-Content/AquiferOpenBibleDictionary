## Immer (Person) (id: 6004)

IMMER (Person)
==============

Priest in the time of David. He became the ancestral head of a house of priests: Pashhur, the priest who had Jeremiah arrested and placed in stocks, was a descendant of Immer ([Jer 20:1](https://ref.ly/Jer20:1)). There were 1,052 priests of the subclan of Immer who returned from the exile ([1 Chr 9:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:12); [Ezr 2:37](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:37); [Neh 7:40](https://ref.ly/Neh7:40)). A descendant of Immer helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall ([Neh 3:29](https://ref.ly/Neh3:29)) and 128 priests under Amashsai (also a descendant) helped resettle the city and tend the temple ([Neh 11:13–14](https://ref.ly/Neh11:13-Neh11:14)).
