## Dove’s Dung (id: 4890)

DOVE’S DUNG
===========

Source of food eaten when Samaria was besieged by Ben\-hadad, king of Syria ([2 Kgs 6:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:25)). Taken literally as pigeon excrement, the reference would indicate how desperate conditions were in the famished city.

Some scholars suggest that dove’s dung refers to the small, edible bulb of the star of Bethlehem plant, also known as bird’s milk or bird’s dung. The bulb could be boiled or roasted to make flour for bread. The “kab” in verse [25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:25) is a unit of measure approximating 1\.3 quarts (1\.2 liters).
