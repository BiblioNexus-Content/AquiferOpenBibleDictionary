## Manna (id: 6925)

MANNA
=====

Manna was the special food that God provided for the Israelites when they were traveling in the desert. It first appeared as thin flakes, like frost on the ground, around the Israelite camp ([Exodus 16:14–15](https://ref.ly/Exod16:14-Exod16:15)). Other parts of the Bible describe manna as looking like coriander seed and bdellium, or resin ([Numbers 11:7](https://ref.ly/Num11:7)). Its taste was like honey or fresh oil ([Exodus 16:31](https://ref.ly/Exod16:31); [Numbers 11:8](https://ref.ly/Num11:8)). These different descriptions of taste and appearance can all be true since people experience taste and color in different ways. The word "manna" comes from the Hebrew word "man," which means "what?" When the Israelites first saw manna, they asked, "What is it?" ([Exodus 16:15](https://ref.ly/Exod16:15)).

Some researchers have tried to connect manna with natural substances found by modern travelers in Sinai and Arabia. For example, in early summer (June–July), the tamarisk tree in these areas produces a sweet liquid because of tiny insects. This liquid falls to the ground and forms small grains that disappear when the sun gets hot. Another suggestion is that manna might have been an edible lichen (a plant\-like organism) that people in southwest Asia use instead of grain during times of hunger. However, the regular appearance, timing, and large amount of manna cannot be explained by natural causes. It was miraculous.

God gave special instructions about the manna. The Israelites were told to gather only enough for one day at a time. Any extra manna they collected would spoil ([Exodus 16:20](https://ref.ly/Exod16:20)). The only exception was the Sabbath day, when they could collect extra for two days. God stopped providing manna after Israel entered Canaan ([Joshua 5:12](https://ref.ly/Josh5:12)). When the Israelites complained and wanted food other than manna, God punished them by sending too many quail ([Numbers 11:4–6, 18–20](https://ref.ly/Num11:4-Num11:6,Num11:18-Num11:20)). 

In poetic parts of the Bible, manna was called "the grain of heaven" ([Psalm 78:24](https://ref.ly/Ps78:24); compare [105:40](https://ref.ly/Ps105:40)). It was also called “the bread of angels” ([78:25](https://ref.ly/Ps78:25)). Jesus later referred to himself as the true manna. He is the bread from heaven which gives eternal life to those who receive him (compare [John 6:25–59](https://ref.ly/John6:25-John6:59)).
