## Spirit (id: 8610)

SPIRIT
======

Designation of that aspect of existence that is noncorporeal and immaterial. Its Latin derivation (as with the Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible—ruach and pneuma) denotes blowing or breathing ([Jb 41:16](https://ref.ly/Job41:16); [Is 25:4](https://ref.ly/Isa25:4)). So the noun *spiritus* signifies breath and life. God, the source of all life, is himself Spirit ([Jn 4:24](https://ref.ly/John4:24)). He put a spirit within all human beings so that they could commune with him in his realm and in his nature. A Christian’s experience of Jesus Christ is made real when that person experiences the Spirit of Jesus Christ in his or her spirit.

Three articles follow that describe three major aspects of spirit: (1\) Spirit of God; (2\) Spirit of Jesus Christ; (3\) spirit of man.
