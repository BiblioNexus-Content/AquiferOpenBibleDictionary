## Zuph (Person) (id: 9265)

ZUPH (Person)
=============

Ancestor of Elkanah, the father of the prophet Samuel ([1 Sm 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1)). Zuph was a member of the Kohathite branch of Levites and is listed as the son of Elkanah (different than above) and the father of Toah ([1 Chr 6:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:35)). He is the same as Zophai listed in [1 Chronicles 6:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:26). It is evident that Zuph was a Levite, even though he is listed as an Ephraimite in the 1 Samuel passage.
