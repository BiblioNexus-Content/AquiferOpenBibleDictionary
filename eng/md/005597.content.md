## Timnah (Place) (id: 8847)

TIMNAH (Place)
==============

1\. One of the cities on the northern boundary of Judah’s inheritance, located between Beth\-shemesh and Ekron ([Jos 15:10](https://ref.ly/Josh15:10)). This is the likely site of Judah’s affair with Tamar, which resulted in the birth of Perez and Zerah ([Gn 38:12–14](https://ref.ly/Gen38:12-Gen38:14)). A frontier town between Judah and Philistia, Timnah was the place where Samson had his first marital difficulties with one of the daughters of the Philistines ([Jgs 14:1–5](https://ref.ly/Judg14:1-Judg14:5); [15:6](https://ref.ly/Judg15:6)). The town evidently changed hands frequently between the Israelites and the Philistines. Apparently, Israel did achieve control of Timnah during the conquest (cf. [Jos 19:43](https://ref.ly/Josh19:43)), but it was under Philistine control by the time of Samson ([Jgs 14:1](https://ref.ly/Judg14:1)). Ahaz recaptured Timnah (c. 730 BC) from the Philistines ([2 Chr 28:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18)).

2\. One of the cities of the southern hill country that was part of the inheritance of Judah ([Jos 15:57](https://ref.ly/Josh15:57)). It is possible that this is the site of Judah’s encounter with Tamar ([Gn 38:12–14](https://ref.ly/Gen38:12-Gen38:14); and perhaps the same as \#1 above).
