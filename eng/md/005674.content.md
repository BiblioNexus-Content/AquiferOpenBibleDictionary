## Tribulation (id: 8923)

TRIBULATION
===========

An experience of suffering, distress, trouble, or persecution. The Greek word appears in the New Testament about 45 times. There is a Hebrew word that appears in four or five Old Testament passages, never in the prophetic books. The New Testament is the main source of meaning for the word.

What Are Common Examples of Tribulation?
----------------------------------------

In the New Testament, the word “tribulation” is sometimes used to mean hardships in the lives of common people, such as: 

* childbirth pain ([John 16:21](https://ref.ly/John16:21))
* concerns in marriage ([1 Corinthians 7:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:28))
* the suffering of widows ([James 1:27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27))

These are all called tribulations. Major disasters like famine are called "great tribulation" ([Acts 7:11](https://ref.ly/Acts7:11)).

What Did Jesus Teach About Tribulation?
---------------------------------------

A more specific understanding of the word "tribulation" means a specific Christian experience. The teachings of Christ provide basic definitions for this meaning of "tribulation." Jesus said that whenever the gospel is present in the world, tribulation is unavoidable. As the word of the gospel is spread, tribulation and persecution will also be present ([Matthew 13:21](https://ref.ly/Matt13:21)).

This idea of tribulation during the church age is carefully developed in Jesus’s teaching on future events. The main source for this teaching comes from Jesus' sermon preached on the Mount of Olives ([Matthew 24–25](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt25:46); [Mark 13](https://ref.ly/Mark13:1-Mark13:37); [Luke 21](https://ref.ly/Luke21:1-Luke21:38)). This teaching provides the only description and clear time frame for the tribulation of his followers. Jesus predicted the beginning, the extent, and the end of tribulation. This teaching on the tribulation was given to the 12 disciples privately ([Matthew 24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3)). 

Jesus told the 12 disciples that they would endure tribulation. This tribulation means persecution to the death for his name’s sake ([Matthew 24:9](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9)). The teaching points to the idea that tribulation would affect Christians in many places throughout history. Jesus's prediction to the 12 disciples that they would be direct victims of tribulation ([Matthew 24:8](https://ref.ly/Matt24:8)), gives a clear starting point.

The same group of disciples would witness the "great tribulation" of Jerusalem as predicted by the prophet Daniel ([Matthew 24:15](https://ref.ly/Matt24:15-Matt24:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt25:46)[21](https://ref.ly/Matt24:15-Matt24:21)). It is clear in the passage that Jesus meant the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70\. The fall of Jerusalem to Roman legions was to be viewed as symbol of ongoing tribulation. Matthew himself makes an editorial comment in [24:15](https://ref.ly/Matt24:15), saying "let the reader understand." This would have alerted his original readers to the fulfillment of Jesus’s prediction within their lifetimes. The parallel section in [Luke 21:20](https://ref.ly/Luke21:20-Luke21:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt25:46)[24](https://ref.ly/Luke21:20-Luke21:24) makes it clear that non\-Jewish people would rule for a long period after the destruction of Jewish Jerusalem. This is what happened after the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70\.

How Should Christians Respond to Tribulation?
---------------------------------------------

The New Testament warns believers to expect tribulation. The New Testament also defines appropriate responses to tribulation: 

* Christians should rejoice in sufferings because of the good fruit. Tribulation produces perseverance and strength of character ([Romans 5:3](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt25:46)[4](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4)).
* They should be patient because God comforts the faithful ([Romans 12:12](https://ref.ly/Rom12:12); [2 Corinthians 1:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:4)).
* They should understand that tribulation prepares believers for glory in eternity ([2 Corinthians 4:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:17)).

It is rare in history for Christians to enjoy wealth and freedom. Most believers throughout history have suffered. The normal work of the church has been to endure as a persecuted minority in an unfriendly world. For Christians who are protected from tribulation, it may seem that tribulation applies to a future period in history. 

Most Christians suffer oppression, rejection, trouble, and persecution. Because of this, the tribulation Jesus predicted is an ever\-present reality. The severity of the tribulation may vary. Yet Christ’s promise remains true: "In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world!" ([John 16:33\)](https://ref.ly/John16:33). *See* Suffering; Eschatology; Persecution.
