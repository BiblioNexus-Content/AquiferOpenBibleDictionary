## Aczib (id: 3356)

ACZIB
=====

1. A city in Judah ([Joshua 15:44](https://ref.ly/Josh15:44)). The prophet Micah listed it with other cities that would be destroyed with Samaria ([Micah 1:14](https://ref.ly/Mic1:14)). It was probably the same city as Chezib ([Genesis 38:5](https://ref.ly/Gen38:5)) and Cozeba ([1 Chronicles 4:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:22)).
2. A city in Asher ([Joshua 19:29](https://ref.ly/Josh19:29)). It was one of seven cities from which Asher failed to remove the Canaanite inhabitants ([Judges 1:31](https://ref.ly/Judg1:31)). Recent archaeological digs at Aczib (modern ez\-Zib) show that people lived in the town from the ninth to the third centuries BC.
