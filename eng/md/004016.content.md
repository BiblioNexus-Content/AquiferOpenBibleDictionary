## Naboth (id: 7273)

NABOTH
======

Owner of a vineyard that Ahab, king of Israel, coveted (see the story in [1 Kgs 21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29)). Ahab’s request was perhaps not unreasonable, and Naboth’s refusal may have been a little curt. While Ahab sulked, however, Jezebel had two scoundrels accuse Naboth of blasphemy, the greatest crime an Israelite could commit, which was punishable by death ([Lv 24:10–23](https://ref.ly/Lev24:10-Lev24:23)). Two witnesses secured a conviction, according to the law of Moses ([Dt 17:6–7](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6-Deut17:7)). The murder that was carried out had the appearance of being a legal and just execution. A fast was proclaimed and held according to royal instructions. The accusation and trial of Naboth was supervised by the elders of the city, and he was stoned to death in accordance with the law.

The prophet Elijah, however, knew the real wickedness that lay behind the deed. He faced Ahab with it and prophesied that he and Jezebel and all their family would be wiped out because of it.

The words came true. Ahab got a temporary reprieve when he repented but was later killed in battle ([1 Kgs 22:34–40](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:34-1Kgs22:40)). The blood of Jezebel was indeed licked up by dogs ([2 Kgs 9:36](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:36)), and the body of Joram, their son, was flung into Naboth’s vineyard (v [25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:25)).
