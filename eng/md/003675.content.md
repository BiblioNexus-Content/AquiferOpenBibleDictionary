MAON (Place)
============

Chief town in the hill country of Judah ([Jos 15:55](https://ref.ly/Josh15:55)), about nine miles (14\.5 kilometers) south of Hebron. David and his men hid in this area while fleeing from Saul ([1 Sm 23:24–25](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:24-1Sam23:25)), and David’s wife Abigail was from this town ([25:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:2-1Sam25:3)). It has been identified with modern Tell Ma’in, where pottery was found dating from the time of David.
