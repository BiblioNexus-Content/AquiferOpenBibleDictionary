## Benjamin (Person) (id: 4113)

BENJAMIN (Person)
=================

1. The youngest of Jacob’s 12 sons and full brother to Joseph. Jacob named him Benjamin (“son of my right hand”) after his dying mother Rachel had called him Ben\-oni (“son of my sorrow,” [Genesis 35:18](https://ref.ly/Gen35:18)). After Joseph had been sold into Egypt by his half brothers, their father, Jacob, assumed that Joseph was dead and became very protective of Benjamin. Later, because of a plan created by Joseph, Benjamin was used to help reunite Jacob with his 12 sons in Egypt ([Genesis 42–45](https://ref.ly/Gen42:1-Gen45:28)). In a prophecy about his sons, Jacob spoke of Benjamin’s skill as a warrior or predicted the military power of his tribe by saying, “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder” ([Genesis 49:27](https://ref.ly/Gen49:27)).

3. Member of Harim’s clan after the exile in Babylon who married a non\-Jewish wife ([Ezra 10:32](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:32)).
