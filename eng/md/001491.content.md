## Damaris (id: 4741)

DAMARIS
=======

A woman who became a follower of Jesus in the city of Athens after hearing Paul teach there ([Acts 17:34](https://ref.ly/Acts17:34)). Because Luke mentions her by name in the Bible, she might have been an important person in Athens (see [Acts 13:50](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50); [17:12](https://ref.ly/Acts17:12)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 13:50; ACT 17:12; ACT 17:34
