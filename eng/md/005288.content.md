## Soap (id: 8551)

SOAP
====

Cleansing agent extracted from a number of alkali\-bearing plants. The alkali was gathered from the ashes of the burned plants and formed into a detergent. Saltwort, soapwort, and glasswort were alkali\-bearing plants indigenous to western Asia and known to the ancient Hebrews. Soap was used primarily for cleansing purposes. In [Jeremiah 2:22](https://ref.ly/Jer2:22) soap is used to clean the body, and in [Malachi 3:2](https://ref.ly/Mal3:2), to wash clothes.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 2:22; MAL 3:2
