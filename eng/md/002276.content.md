## Gratitude (id: 5529)

GRATITUDE
=========

A natural expression of thanks in response to blessings, protection, or love. In the tradition common to Judaism and Christianity, gratitude is not a tool used to manipulate the will of God. It is never coerced or fabricated in one’s mind. Rather, gratitude is a joyful commitment of one’s personality to God.

In the Old Testament, gratitude to God was the only condition in which life could be enjoyed. For Jews, every aspect of creation provided evidence of God’s lordship over all life. The Hebrew people thanked him for the magnificence of the universe ([Psalms 19:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:4); [33:6–9](https://ref.ly/Ps33:6-Ps33:9); [104:1–24](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:24)). When they received good news, they thanked God for his goodness and great deeds ([1 Chronicles 16:8–12](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:8-1Chr16:12)). When they received bad news, they also gave thanks, trusting that he was a just God ([Job 1:21](https://ref.ly/Job1:21)).

These same sentiments are found in later Jewish writings such as the Talmud. The people of Israel thanked God for his faithfulness to covenant promises: 

1. The Israelites thanked God for deliverance from enemies ([Psalms 18:17](https://ref.ly/Ps18:17); [30:1](https://ref.ly/Ps30:1); [44:1–8](https://ref.ly/Ps44:1-Ps44:8)) and from death ([Ps 30:8–12](https://ref.ly/Ps30:8-Ps30:12); [Isaiah 38:18–20\)](https://ref.ly/Isa38:18-Isa38:20).
2. The Israelites thanked God for forgiveness of sin ([Psalms 32:5](https://ref.ly/Ps32:5); [99:8](https://ref.ly/Ps99:8); [103:3](https://ref.ly/Ps103:3); [Isaiah 12:1](https://ref.ly/Isa12:1)).
3. The Israelites thanked God for answers to prayer ([Psalms 28:6](https://ref.ly/Ps28:6); [66:19](https://ref.ly/Ps66:19)).
4. The Israelites thanked God for compassion toward the afflicted and oppressed ([Psalms 34:2](https://ref.ly/Ps34:2); [72:12](https://ref.ly/Ps72:12)).
5. The Israelites thanked God for executing justice ([Deuteronomy 32:4](https://ref.ly/Deut32:4); [Psalm 99:4](https://ref.ly/Ps99:4)).
6. The Israelites thanked God for continuing guidance ([Psalm 32:8](https://ref.ly/Ps32:8); [Isaiah 30:20–21](https://ref.ly/Isa30:20-Isa30:21)).

Gratitude was such a vital part of Israel’s religion that it pervaded most ceremonies and customs. Thank offerings acknowledged blessings from God ([Leviticus 7:12–13](https://ref.ly/Lev7:12-Lev7:13); [22:29](https://ref.ly/Lev22:29); [Psalm 50:14](https://ref.ly/Ps50:14)). Shouts of joy ([Psalm 42:4](https://ref.ly/Ps42:4)), songs of praise ([Psalms 145:7](https://ref.ly/Ps145:7); [149:1](https://ref.ly/Ps149:1)), and music and dance ([Psalm 150:3–5](https://ref.ly/Ps150:3-Ps150:5)) all added to the spirit of thanksgiving in worship. Feasts and festivals were celebrated in remembrance of God’s steadfast love throughout their history ([Deuteronomy 16:9–15](https://ref.ly/Deut16:9-Deut16:15); [2 Chronicles 30:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:21-2Chr30:22)). King David appointed Levitical priests to offer God thanks ([1 Chronicles 16:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:4)). This custom was carried on by the kings Solomon ([2 Chronicles 5:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12-2Chr5:13)) and Hezekiah ([2 Chronicles 31:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:2)) and by those who returned from the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 11:17](https://ref.ly/Neh11:17); [12:24, 27](https://ref.ly/Neh12:24,Neh12:27)).

In the New Testament, the object of thanksgiving is the love of God expressed in the redemptive work of Christ. The apostle Paul thanked God for that gift of grace ([1 Corinthians 1:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:4); [2 Corinthians 9:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:15)) and the ability to preach the gospel ([2 Corinthians 2:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:14); [1 Timothy 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:12)). Paul thankfully participated in the spiritual gifts ([1 Corinthians 14:18](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:18)). Gratitude for love and faith among believers pervades his letters ([Romans 6:17](https://ref.ly/Rom6:17); [Ephesians 1:15–16](https://ref.ly/Eph1:15-Eph1:16); [Philippians 1:3–5](https://ref.ly/Phil1:3-Phil1:5); [Colossians 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/Col1:3-Col1:4); [1 Thessalonians 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:2-1Thess1:3)).

Because the expression of gratitude is tied so closely to the response of faith, Paul encouraged believers to give thanks in all things ([Romans 14:6](https://ref.ly/Rom14:6); [1 Thessalonians 5:18](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:18)). He commanded Christians to pray with thanksgiving in the name of Christ ([Philippians 4:6](https://ref.ly/Phil4:6); [Colossians 4:2](https://ref.ly/Col4:2)), who has made all thanksgiving possible ([Ephesians 5:20](https://ref.ly/Eph5:20)). In his teaching on how to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, Paul specified that Christians should give thanks, just as the Lord “had given thanks” ([1 Corinthians 11:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:24)).
