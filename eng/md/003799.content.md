## Meraioth (id: 7058)

MERAIOTH
========

1\. Levite, six to seven generations removed from Aaron ([1 Chr 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:6-1Chr6:7); [Ezr 7:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:3)).

2\. Ahitub’s son and the father of Zadok ([1 Chr 9:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:11); [Neh 11:11](https://ref.ly/Neh11:11)); perhaps identifiable with \#1 above, despite differences in genealogy.

3\. Priestly house whose head was Helkai during the days of Joiakim in postexilic Jerusalem ([Neh 12:15](https://ref.ly/Neh12:15)). Its forebear is given as Meremoth (v [3](https://ref.ly/Neh12:3)). Some regard [Nehemiah 12:15](https://ref.ly/Neh12:15) as a scribal error and identify the names in verses [3](https://ref.ly/Neh12:3) and [15](https://ref.ly/Neh12:15) as the same person.
