## Merari, Merarite (id: 7059)

MERARI, MERARITE
================

In Hebrew, Arabic, and Akkadian languages, the word *Merari* means “bitter,” “bitter drink,” or “to be bitter.” In Ugaritic, it means “to strengthen, to bless.” Most people have understood the name to mean “gall” or “bitterness” based on its Hebrew meaning. But the Ugaritic meaning “to strengthen, to bless” also fits with Hebrew thinking. When used as a person's name, it probably means “strength” or “blessing.” This meaning makes more sense in many Bible references. 

For Merari, the third son of Levi, the meaning “strength” or “blessing” seems better because of his importance and his family's role. It would be strange for the youngest son to have a name meaning “gall” or “bitterness” when he had the greatest responsibility and received the greatest reward for his service.

The Bible mentions Merari, the son of Levi, many times. He was the youngest of Levi's three sons ([Genesis 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11); [Exodus 6:16–19](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16-Exod6:19); [Numbers 3:17–20, 33](https://ref.ly/Num3:17-Num3:20,Num3:33); [1 Chronicles 6:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1)). He was the father of two sons, Mahli and Mushi ([Exodus 6:19](https://ref.ly/Exod6:19); [Numbers 3:20](https://ref.ly/Num3:20)). Merari's sons had the important job of carrying the frames, bars, pillars, bases, vessels, and accessories of the tabernacle ([Numbers 3:36–37](https://ref.ly/Num3:36-Num3:37); [4:31–33](https://ref.ly/Num4:31-Num4:33); [7:8](https://ref.ly/Num7:8); [10:17](https://ref.ly/Num10:17); [Joshua 21:7, 34, 40](https://ref.ly/Josh21:7,Josh21:34,Josh21:40)). His descendants are known as Merarites. Chronicles mentions Merari's family many times, showing how important they were ([1 Chronicles 6](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1-1Chr6:81); [9](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:1-1Chr9:44); [15](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:1-1Chr15:29); [23](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:1-1Chr23:32); [26](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:1-1Chr26:32); [2 Chronicles 29](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:1-2Chr29:36); [34](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:1-2Chr34:33)).
