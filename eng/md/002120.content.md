## Gatekeepers (id: 5375)

GATEKEEPERS
===========

The people who guarded the gates of cities and the doors of palaces, temples, and other large buildings. Their task was to decide who could enter and who could not ([2 Kings 7:10–11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs7:10-2Kgs7:11); [11:4–9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:4-2Kgs11:9)). In the Bible these people are called by different names such as gatekeepers, porters, doorkeepers, and guards.
