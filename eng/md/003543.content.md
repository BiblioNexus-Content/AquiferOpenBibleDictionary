## Lydia (Person) (id: 6800)

LYDIA (Person)
==============

Lydia was a non\-Jewish woman who became a Christian after hearing Paul preach in the city of Philippi ([Acts 16:14, 40](https://ref.ly/Acts16:14,Acts16:40)). She was a businesswoman who sold expensive purple cloth. Lydia came from the city of Thyatira in the region of Lydia. This was in the western part of the Roman province of Asia (commonly known as Asia Minor). 

Acts describes Lydia as “a worshiper of God” (or “God\-fearer”). This indicates that she was a gentile attracted to Judaism. She converted to Christianity and Paul baptized her. Then Lydia invited Paul and Silas to stay at her home during their time in Philippi.
