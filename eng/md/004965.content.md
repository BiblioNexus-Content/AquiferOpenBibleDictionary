## Sepharad (id: 8228)

SEPHARAD\*
==========

Place of exile for the Jews of Jerusalem ([Ob 1:20](https://ref.ly/Obad1:20), nlt mg). Its location is not certain; however, good evidence is available to support Sardis, the capital of Lydia, in Asia Minor as the place of captivity. Other less feasible suggestions are Saparda in eastern Assyria, where Sargon transported Jews, and Spain, as mentioned in the Targum of Jonathan.
