## Miscarriage (id: 7157)

MISCARRIAGE
===========

The sudden natural end of an unborn child before it can survive outside the womb. Miscarriage happens in both animal and human pregnancies ([Genesis 31:38](https://ref.ly/Gen31:38); [Job 3:16](https://ref.ly/Job3:16); [21:10](https://ref.ly/Job21:10); [Hosea 9:14](https://ref.ly/Hos9:14)). The main problem is not the inability to become pregnant but the difficulty in carrying the pregnancy to full term. The curse of a "miscarrying womb" means a woman cannot have children ([Hosea 9:14](https://ref.ly/Hos9:14)). The blessing of God results in successful pregnancies and long life ([Exodus 23:26](https://ref.ly/Exod23:26)).

The key issue in miscarriage is timing, shown by early delivery or what the Bible calls an “untimely birth” ([Psalm 58:8](https://ref.ly/Ps58:8); [Job 3:16](https://ref.ly/Job3:16)). Although miscarriages happen for many reasons, the Bible mentions two specific causes: 

* poor care of pregnant animals ([Genesis 31:38](https://ref.ly/Gen31:38)), and
* physical injury to a pregnant woman ([Exodus 21:22](https://ref.ly/Exod21:22)).

[Numbers 5](https://ref.ly/Num5:1-Num5:31) describes a test for a wife suspected of being unfaithful. If she is guilty of adultery, “her belly will swell, her thigh will shrivel” ([Numbers 5:27](https://ref.ly/Num5:27)). These phrases might be ways of describing either a miscarriage or the inability to have children.

The apostle Paul emphasizes his unworthiness to be an apostle by comparing his spiritual birth to a premature physical birth ([1 Corinthians 15:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:8)).
