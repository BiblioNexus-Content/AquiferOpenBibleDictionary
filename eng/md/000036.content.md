ABIEZER
=======

1. A descendant of Manasseh ([Joshua 17:1](https://ref.ly/Josh17:1-Josh17:2)–[2](https://ref.ly/Josh17:1-Josh17:2)). Abiezer’s father is not named, but he is listed with the descendants of his mother’s brother, Gilead ([1 Chronicles 7:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:18)). In [Numbers 26:30](https://ref.ly/Num26:30), Abiezer’s name is shortened to Iezer, and his family is called Iezerites. Gideon was a part of Abiezer’s family, and they were the first to respond to his call to fight the Midianites ([Judges 6:34](https://ref.ly/Judg6:34)). Abiezer’s descendants were called Abiezrites ([Judges 6:11, 24, 34](https://ref.ly/Judg6:11,Judg6:24,Judg6:34); [8:32](https://ref.ly/Judg8:32)).

Abiezer was made leader of the ninth division of the army in the rotation system established by David ([1 Chronicles 27:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:12)).
