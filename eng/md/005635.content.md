=====

One of the villages settled by the tribe of Simeon ([1 Chronicles 4:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:32), spelled “Tochen” in the King James Version). The name does not appear in a similar passage in [Joshua 19](https://ref.ly/Josh19:1-Josh19:51). However, in that list in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) it is written as Thokka.
