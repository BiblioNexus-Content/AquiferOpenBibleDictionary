## Beth-Anath (id: 4151)

BETH\-ANATH
===========

A town given to the tribe of Naphtali ([Joshua 19:38](https://ref.ly/Josh19:38)). The tribe did not drive out the people who originally lived there ([Judges 1:33](https://ref.ly/Judg1:33)). The Israelites often made slaves of the remaining Canaanite people. They were then corrupted by the non\-Jewish religious practices.
