## Death, the Second (id: 4782)

DEATH, The Second
=================

Term used in the NT only in the book of Revelation, to describe God’s eternal judgment on sin. Originally a rabbinic expression, the second death will be experienced by those whose names are not written in the “Book of Life” ([Rv 20:15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:15)). The second death is equated with the “lake of fire” (v [14](https://ref.ly/Rev20:14)), or the lake that burns with “fire and brimstone” ([21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8), kjv), and is described as the lot of “the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, . . . murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars” (rsv). Those who are victorious in this life have nothing to fear from the second death ([2:11](https://ref.ly/Rev2:11)).
