## Aloe (id: 3525)

ALOE
====

The aloe is a plant found mostly in Africa that looks similar to a lily. Some types of aloe provide both medicine and fiber. In the Bible, aloe is mentioned with other fragrant plants like myrrh and balm (see [Psalm 45:8](https://ref.ly/Ps45:8); [Proverbs 7:17](https://ref.ly/Prov7:17); [Song of Solomon 4:14](https://ref.ly/Song4:14); [John 19:39](https://ref.ly/John19:39)).

Most scholars believe these verses refer to two different plants: 

* In the Old Testament, aloe likely refers to the eaglewood tree (*Aquilaria agallocha*). This large tree comes from northern India, Malaya, and Indochina. It can grow up to 36\.6 meters (120 feet) tall with a trunk about 3\.7 meters (12 feet) around. As its wood decays, it produces a strong fragrance. This makes it valuable for perfume, incense, and fumigation. In ancient times, people would burn fragrant woods to fill spaces with aromatic smoke.
* In the New Testament ([John 19:39](https://ref.ly/John19:39)), aloe probably refers to the true aloe (*Aloe succotrina*). Egyptians used its bitter juice in the embalming process. Embalming is a process that preserves dead bodies. Though true aloe does not smell very pleasant, people sometimes used it as a medicine for horses.
