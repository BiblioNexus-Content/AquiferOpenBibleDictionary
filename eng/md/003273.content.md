KEDESH
======

1\. Town in the Judean Negev ([Jos 15:23](https://ref.ly/Josh15:23)); its appearance alongside Adadah (Aroer) argues against its identification with Kadesh\-barnea.

2\. City of refuge in upper Galilee, in the territory of Naphtali ([Jos 20:7](https://ref.ly/Josh20:7)), set apart for the Gershonite clan of Levi ([Jos 21:32](https://ref.ly/Josh21:32); [1 Chr 6:76](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:76)), and the home of Barak ([Jgs 4:6](https://ref.ly/Judg4:6)). It was conquered by Tiglath\-pileser III in 732 BC ([2 Kgs 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)). Jonathan Maccabeus defeated the army of Demetrius there ([1 Macc 11:63, 73](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:63,1Macc11:73)). It is identified with Tell Qades, four and a half miles (7\.2 kilometers) northwest of Lake Huleh.

3\. Levitical city in Issachar ([1 Chr 6:72](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:72)); the parallel passage has Kishion ([Jos 21:28](https://ref.ly/Josh21:28)).
