## Kedemoth (id: 6530)

KEDEMOTH
========

City east of the Jordan, probably located on the upper course of the Arnon River. From the wilderness of Kedemoth, Moses sent messengers to Sihon, king of Heshbon, asking permission to pass peaceably through his land ([Dt 2:26](https://ref.ly/Deut2:26)). In the division of the land, Kedemoth was given to Reuben’s tribe ([Jos 13:18](https://ref.ly/Josh13:18)) and then set aside as one of the Levitical cities for the Merarites ([Jos 21:37](https://ref.ly/Josh21:37); [1 Chr 6:79](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:79)).
