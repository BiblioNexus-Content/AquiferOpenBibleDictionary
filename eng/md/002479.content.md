## Hazazon-Tamar (id: 5733)

HAZAZON\-TAMAR
==============

City identifiable with En\-gedi in [2 Chronicles 20:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:2). During the time of Abraham, it was inhabited by Amorites who were subdued by Kedorlaomer as he and other eastern kings swept through the area ([Gn 14:7](https://ref.ly/Gen14:7)). It has been suggested that it may be the Tamar that Solomon fortified ([1 Kgs 9:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:18)), placed by Ezekiel southeast of Israel ([Ez 47:18–19](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:18-Ezek47:19); [48:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:28)). Wadi Hasasa has apparently been named after the ancient site.
