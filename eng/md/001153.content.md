## Candle, Candlestick (id: 4408)

CANDLE, CANDLESTICK
===================

The words candle and candlestick appear in older Bible versions like the King James Version. But these words are better translated as lamp and lampstand.

Candles made of wax with a wick like we use today did not exist in Bible times. People used small clay or metal lamps filled with oil. A piece of cloth served as the wick.
