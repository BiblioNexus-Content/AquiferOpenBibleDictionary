## Harbona (id: 5662)

HARBONA
=======

One of King Ahasuerus’s seven personal servants. Ahasuerus (also called Xerxes) ordered them to parade Queen Vashti before a drunken feast so everyone could see her beauty ([Esther 1:10](https://ref.ly/Esth1:10)). Harbona later suggested that Haman be hanged using the gallows Haman had built to execute Mordecai ([Esther 7:9](https://ref.ly/Esth7:9)).
