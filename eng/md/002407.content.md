## Harar, Hararite (id: 5660)

HARAR, HARARITE
===============

The terms "Harar" and "Hararite" are used to describe several of King David's "mighty men" in the Bible. A Hararite was someone who came from a place called Harar. 

Shammah was one of the mightiest men of David. He was father of Jonathan. This is a different Jonathan than the son of King Saul who was a friend of David. Shammah was a Hararite ([2 Samuel 23:11, 33](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11,2Sam23:33); [1 Chronicles 11:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:34) has “Shagee”). Agee, the father of Shammah was also a Hararite ([2 Samuel 23:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11)). Sharar, the father of Ahiam, is also called a Hararite ([2 Samuel 23:33](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:33); in [1 Chronicles 11:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:35) he is called “Sachar”). 

We are not completely sure what these terms mean. They might refer to a mountain village called Harar, or they might mean "mountaineer" (someone who lives in the mountains).
