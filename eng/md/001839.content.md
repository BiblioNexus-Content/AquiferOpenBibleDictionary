## En-rogel (id: 5092)

EN\-ROGEL
=========

En\-rogel is a spring (natural water source) near Jerusalem. En\-rogel marked part of the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin ([Joshua 15:7](https://ref.ly/Josh15:7); [18:16](https://ref.ly/Josh18:16)). 

Jonathan and Ahimaaz once hid at En\-rogel while spying on Absalom’s army for King David ([2 Samuel 17:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17)). A servant girl carried their message from the spring to the king. Later, Adonijah offered sacrifices there when he tried to make himself king before David died ([1 Kings 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9)).

Some think En\-rogel was a spring in a cave near Siloam, on the west side of the Kidron Valley. This spring is called the Virgin’s Fount. However, many scholars believe this spring is actually the Gihon Spring ([1 Kings 1:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:33)), which the Bible treats as a different place. A better suggestion is that En\-rogel was a spring south of Jerusalem, known today as the Well of Job.
