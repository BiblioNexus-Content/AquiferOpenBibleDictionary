## Sons of the Prophets (id: 8574)

SONS OF THE PROPHETS\*
======================

“Band of prophets” whom Saul met ([1 Sm 10:5–6, 10–13](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:5-1Sam10:6,1Sam10:10-1Sam10:13)) and forerunners of the “schools,” “guilds,” or “sons of the prophets,” which flourished under Israel’s early kings. Jezebel persecuted those defending the worship of Yahweh and established rival “schools” to propagate worship of Baal and Asherah ([1 Kgs 18:19–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:19-1Kgs18:29); [22:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:6)). Ahab’s steward, Obadiah, sheltered two companies of 50 prophets of Yahweh in caves and gave them provisions ([18:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:4)).

[First Kings 22:5–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:5-1Kgs22:28) illustrates the political danger of such royal guilds, and chronicles the emergence of individual spokesmen claiming spontaneous inspiration. [First Kings 20:35–43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:35-1Kgs20:43) shows another individual, acting strangely yet recognizable as a true prophet. From [2 Kings 2–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:1-2Kgs6:33), we learn that groups persisted at Bethel (about 50\) and Gilgal (about 100\).
