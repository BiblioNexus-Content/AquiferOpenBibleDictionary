## Spring Rains, Latter Rain (id: 6693)

SPRING RAINS
============

Palestine's yearly spring rains fall from late March to early April. The spring rains (or latter rains) come after the citrus harvest and before the wheat and barley harvests. The spring rains typically mark the end of the rainy season until the fall rains start again in October. 

In the Bible, the spring rains were associated with God's favor or displeasure with Israel ([Deuteronomy 11:13–17](https://ref.ly/Deut11:13-Deut11:17); [Job 29:23](https://ref.ly/Job29:23); [Proverbs 16:15](https://ref.ly/Prov16:15); [Jeremiah 3:3](https://ref.ly/Jer3:3); [Hosea 6:3](https://ref.ly/Hos6:3); [Joel 2:23](https://ref.ly/Joel2:23); [Zechariah 10:1](https://ref.ly/Zech10:1); [James 5:7](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7)).
