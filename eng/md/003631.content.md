## Malachi (Person) (id: 6891)

MALACHI (Person)
================

Author of the last book of the OT ([Mal 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mal1:1)). The prophet Malachi lived about 500–460 BC. His name means “my angel” or “my messenger” and is so translated in [Malachi 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mal3:1) and elsewhere. Apart from the book that bears his name, nothing else is known about him from the Bible. In the apocryphal book of [2 Esdras 1:40](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:40) he is identified as “Malachi, who is also called a messenger of the Lord.” Rabbinic tradition suggests that Malachi may be another name for Ezra the scribe, although there is no supporting evidence for this identification.
