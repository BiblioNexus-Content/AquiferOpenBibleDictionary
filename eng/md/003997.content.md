## Myrtle (id: 7254)

MYRTLE
======

An evergreen shrub with small leaves and scented flowers ([Isaiah 41:19](https://ref.ly/Isa41:19)). The myrtle tree (*Myrtus communis*)is common in Israel and the surrounding areas, especially around Bethlehem, Lebanon, Hebron, as well as the slopes of Mount Carmel and Mount Tabor. It is native to western Asia and in good growing conditions can become a small evergreen tree 6\.2 to 9\.1 meters (20 to 30 feet) tall. More often, however, it grows as a short bush 0\.5 to 1\.2 meters (one and a half to four feet) tall.

In the Bible, myrtle is mainly mentioned as a symbol of God's generosity. Nehemiah ordered people to gather branches of myrtle trees, among others, for the Feast of Tabernacles ([Nehemiah 8:15](https://ref.ly/Neh8:15)). The myrtle was symbolic not only of peace but also of justice.
