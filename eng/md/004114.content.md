## Netophah, Netophathite (id: 7374)

NETOPHAH, NETOPHATHITE
======================

Netophah was a place near Bethlehem in the Old Testament. A Netophathite was someone who came from that place.

Two of David’s thirty mighty warriors came from Netophah ([2 Samuel 23:28–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:28-2Sam23:29); [1 Chronicles 11:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:30); [27:13–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:13-1Chr27:15)). Seraiah, one of the army leaders who met Gedaliah after Jerusalem fell to Babylon in 586 BC, was also a Netophathite ([2 Kings 25:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23); [Jeremiah 40:8](https://ref.ly/Jer40:8)).

Later, 56 men from Netophah returned from exile in Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua ([Ezra 2:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:22)).

Levites also lived in the villages of the Netophathites ([1 Chronicles 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:16)). Temple singers came from villages around Jerusalem, including those near Netophah ([Nehemiah 12:28](https://ref.ly/Neh12:28)). These verses suggest that Netophah was not just a town but part of a larger area or district.

Netophah was likely located near Bethlehem (see [1 Chronicles 2:54](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54); [Nehemiah 7:26](https://ref.ly/Neh7:26)). We do not know the exact location, but many believe it was at Khirbet Bedd Faluh, about 4\.8 kilometers (3 miles) southeast of Bethlehem.
