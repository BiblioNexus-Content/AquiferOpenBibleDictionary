## Stones, Precious (id: 8628)

STONES, Precious
================

A lengthy list of the precious stones used in OT times occurs in [Exodus 28:17–20](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17-Exod28:20) and [39:10–13](https://ref.ly/Exod39:10-Exod39:13), where four rows of three stones, each engraved with the name of one of the 12 tribes of Israel, were set in the high priest’s breastplate. Other lists occur in [Ezekiel 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13) and [Revelation 21:19–21](https://ref.ly/Rev21:19-Rev21:21). It is difficult to properly identify all of these stones, since an accurate translation is not always possible. Some of the differences of translation are indicated in the following list, as translated in the rsv:

1\. Agate, an oxide of silicon, a type of translucent quartz with layers of different colors ([Ex 28:19](https://ref.ly/Exod28:19); [39:12](https://ref.ly/Exod39:12); [Is 54:12](https://ref.ly/Isa54:12); [Rv 21:19](https://ref.ly/Rev21:19)).

2\. Alabaster, a finely granular banded variety of calcium carbonate (gypsum), often white and translucent and widely used in Bible times for ornamental vases, bowls, kohl pots, statues, perfume jars, and so on ([Sg 5:15](https://ref.ly/Song5:15); [Mt 26:7](https://ref.ly/Matt26:7); [Mk 14:3](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3); [Lk 7:37](https://ref.ly/Luke7:37)).

3\. Amethyst, an oxide of silicon, a purple or violet variety of transparent crystalline quartz ([Ex 28:19](https://ref.ly/Exod28:19); [39:12](https://ref.ly/Exod39:12); [Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)).

4\. Beryl, a silicate of aluminum ([Ex 28:20](https://ref.ly/Exod28:20); [39:13](https://ref.ly/Exod39:13); [Sg 5:14](https://ref.ly/Song5:14); [Dn 10:6](https://ref.ly/Dan10:6)). It is usually green in color ([Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)) but can be blue, white, or golden and may be either opaque or transparent—the latter variety including the gems emerald and aquamarine.

5\. Carbuncle. See Emerald below.

6\. Carnelian, a silicon oxide reddish in color. In translations it is sometimes equated with sardius ([Ex 28:17](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17); [39:10](https://ref.ly/Exod39:10); [Ez 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)), a type of deep brown or red quartz ([Rv 4:3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:3); [21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)).

7\. Chalcedony. See Agate above.

8\. Chrysolite, an aluminum fluosilicate, yellowish in color ([Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)), probably equivalent to topaz ([Ex 28:17](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17)) or beryl ([Ez 1:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:16); [10:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:9); [28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)).

9\. Chrysoprase, a nickel\-stained apple\-green chalcedony widely used in jewelry ([Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)).

10\. Coral, the hard calcareous skeleton of a variety of marine animals occurring in various colors—red, white, and black. It is not strictly a stone ([Jb 28:18](https://ref.ly/Job28:18); [Ez 27:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:16)).

11\. Crystal, a clear, translucent crystalline quartz ([Jb 28:18](https://ref.ly/Job28:18)). In [Revelation 4:6](https://ref.ly/Rev4:6), [21:11](https://ref.ly/Rev21:11), and [22:1](https://ref.ly/Rev22:1)the Greek word krystallon may be rock crystal or even ice.

12\. Diamond, a stone of uncertain identification ([Ex 28:18](https://ref.ly/Exod28:18); [39:11](https://ref.ly/Exod39:11); [Ez 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)). It may not be the equivalent of the modern diamond. In [Jeremiah 17:1](https://ref.ly/Jer17:1), adamant was probably a form of corundum, a very hard substance.

13\. Emerald, probably a green stone like the modern emerald ([Ex 28:18](https://ref.ly/Exod28:18); [39:11](https://ref.ly/Exod39:11); [Ez 27:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:16); [28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)). The Septuagint suggests a purple stone like a garnet. In the NT smaragdinos in [Revelation 4:3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:3) and smaragdos in [Revelation 21:19](https://ref.ly/Rev21:19) suggest an emerald.

14\. Jacinth, perhaps a reddish\-orange zircon or a blue stone such as turquoise, amethyst, or sapphire ([Ex 28:19](https://ref.ly/Exod28:19); [39:12](https://ref.ly/Exod39:12)). In [Revelation 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20) huakinthos is a blue stone. The exact identification is uncertain.

15\. Jasper, a compact, opaque, often highly colored crystalline quartz substance ([Ex 28:20](https://ref.ly/Exod28:20); [39:13](https://ref.ly/Exod39:13)). In the NT the Greek term iaspis ([Rv 4:3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:3); [21:11, 18–19](https://ref.ly/Rev21:11,Rev21:18-Rev21:19)) is a green quartz.

16\. Lapis lazuli, a deep blue stone; a compound of sodium, aluminum, calcium, sulphur, and silver containing a mixture of several minerals. It generally has golden flecks of iron pyrites and was widely used for ornamental purposes in the ancient world. It is akin to sapphire.

17\. Marble, a limestone crystallized by metamorphism, taking a high polish, durable and suitable for building purposes ([1 Chr 29:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:2); [Est 1:6](https://ref.ly/Esth1:6); [Rv 18:12](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12)).

18\. Onyx, a quartz consisting of straight layers or bands which differ in color ([Gn 2:12](https://ref.ly/Gen2:12); [Ex 25:7](https://ref.ly/Exod25:7); [28:9, 20](https://ref.ly/Exod28:9,Exod28:20); [39:6, 13](https://ref.ly/Exod39:6,Exod39:13); [1 Chr 29:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:2); [Jb 28:16](https://ref.ly/Job28:16); [Ez 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)). See Sardonyx below.

19\. Pearl, a hard smooth substance, white or variously colored, which grows in the shell of various bivalve mollusks. In the NT “pearls” are known as ornaments for women ([1 Tm 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:9); [Rv 17:4](https://ref.ly/Rev17:4)) or as items for trade ([Rv 18:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12,Rev18:16)). The kingdom of heaven is likened to a fine pearl, which people seek at great cost ([Mt 13:45–46](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)).

20\. Ruby, an uncertain translation of the Hebrew word peninim in six places ([Jb 28:18](https://ref.ly/Job28:18); [Prv 3:15](https://ref.ly/Prov3:15); [8:11](https://ref.ly/Prov8:11); [20:15](https://ref.ly/Prov20:15); [31:10](https://ref.ly/Prov31:10); [Lam 4:7](https://ref.ly/Lam4:7)). This deep red or carmine stone was probably known in the ancient world, but there are difficulties in the translation of terms that may refer to it.

21\. Sapphire, a deep blue stone ([Ex 24:10](https://ref.ly/Exod24:10); [28:18](https://ref.ly/Exod28:18); [39:11](https://ref.ly/Exod39:11); [Jb 28:6, 16](https://ref.ly/Job28:6,Job28:16); [Sg 5:14](https://ref.ly/Song5:14); [Is 54:11](https://ref.ly/Isa54:11); [Lam 4:7](https://ref.ly/Lam4:7); [Ez 1:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:26); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1); [28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13)), which may have referred at times to lapis lazuli as in [Job 28:6](https://ref.ly/Job28:6) and [Revelation 21:19](https://ref.ly/Rev21:19).

22\. Sardius, a red or deep brown form of quartz ([Ex 28:17](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17); [39:10](https://ref.ly/Exod39:10); [Ez 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13) kjv). It is referred to also in [Revelation 4:3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:3) (kjv “sardine stone”), though in modern versions it is often rendered as “carnelian.” See Carnelian above.

23\. Sardonyx, a form of agate with layers of brown and white ([Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20), kjv, nasb; “onyx” in nlt).

24\. Topaz, a yellow stone, a fluosilicate of aluminum occurring in crystalline form ([Ex 28:17](https://ref.ly/Exod28:17); [39:10](https://ref.ly/Exod39:10); [Jb 28:19](https://ref.ly/Job28:19); [Ez 28:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:13); [Rv 21:20](https://ref.ly/Rev21:20)).
