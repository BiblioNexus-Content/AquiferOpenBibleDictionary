## Libnah (id: 6738)

LIBNAH
======

1. One of the locations where the Israelites camped during the wilderness journey. It was between Rimmon\-perez and Rissah ([Numbers 33:20–21](https://ref.ly/Num33:20-Num33:21)).

    *See* Wilderness Wanderings.

2. A Canaanite city\-state in southern Palestine. Under the leadership of Joshua, Israel conquered and destroyed Libnah ([Joshua 10:29–31](https://ref.ly/Josh10:29-Josh10:31); [12:15](https://ref.ly/Josh12:15)). It was in the territory of Judah ([15:42](https://ref.ly/Josh15:42)). Later, the Levites received it as an inheritance ([Joshua 21:13](https://ref.ly/Josh21:13); [1 Chronicles 6:57](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:57)).

    The Bible mentions three later events connected to Libnah:

    1. During the reign of King Jehoram of Judah, Libnah rebelled against him around the same time that Edom also rebelled. Judah brought them under control ([2 Kings 8:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:22); [2 Chronicles 21:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:10)).
        2. After King Sennacherib of Assyria captured the city of Lachish, he attacked Libnah ([2 Kings 19:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:8); [Isaiah 37:8](https://ref.ly/Isa37:8)). Earlier Isaiah had affirmed to King Hezekiah there would be a rumor. This would cause the invading king to interrupt his military campaign against Judah and return to his own land. While Sennacherib was surrounding and attacking Libnah, the prophecy of Isaiah came true ([2 Kings 19:7–8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:7-2Kgs19:8)).
        3. The mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, two of last kings of Judah, was from Libnah ([2 Kings 23:31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:31); [24:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:18); [Jeremiah 52:1](https://ref.ly/Jer52:1)).
