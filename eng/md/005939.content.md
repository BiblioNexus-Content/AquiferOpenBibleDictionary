## Zephath (id: 9185)

ZEPHATH
=======

Zephath was a Canaanite city that was conquered by the tribes of Judah and Simeon. After they captured it, they renamed it Hormah ([Judges 1:17](https://ref.ly/Judg1:17)). was the place where the Israelites first tried to enter Canaan but failed. This happened when they disobeyed the command of Moses. As a result, the Amalekites and the Canaanites defeated them ([Numbers 14:45](https://ref.ly/Num14:45)).
