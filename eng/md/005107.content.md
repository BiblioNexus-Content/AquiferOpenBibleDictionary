## Shephuphan (id: 8371)

SHEPHUPHAN
==========

Bela’s son from Benjamin’s tribe. Bela was the firstborn of Benjamin’s sons ([1 Chr 8:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:5)). The exact position of Shephuphan in Benjamin’s genealogy is unclear, and he is perhaps identifiable with Shephupham ([1 Chr 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:12)).
