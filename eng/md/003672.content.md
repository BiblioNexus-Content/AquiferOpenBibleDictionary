## Manoah (id: 6926)

MANOAH
======

Danite from Zorah whose wife was barren. Through encounters with the Angel of the Lord, the couple learned that God was about to give them a son who would judge the Philistines and deliver Israel from its oppression. Manoah later fathered Samson, who fulfilled these promises ([Jgs 13](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg13:25); [16:31](https://ref.ly/Judg16:31)).
