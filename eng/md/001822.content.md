## Enchantment (id: 5076)

ENCHANTMENT
===========

The act of casting charms or spells to influence others or to gain insight. Balaam could cast no enchantment against Israel but could only bless them ([Numbers 23:23](https://ref.ly/Num23:23)). Enchanters were among the wise men of Nebuchadnezzar’s court. Daniel and his three friends were judged to be ten times wiser than the enchanters ([Daniel 1:20](https://ref.ly/Dan1:20)). The enchanters were not able to recall King Nebuchadnezzar’s forgotten dream ([2:2–27](https://ref.ly/Dan2:2-Dan2:27)). They could not interpret his second dream, either ([4:7](https://ref.ly/Dan4:7)). Later, under Belshazzar, they could not read the handwriting that appeared on the palace wall ([5:7–15](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:15)). According to the prophet Isaiah, the great powers of Babylon’s enchantments would not save it from destruction ([Isaiah 47:9, 12](https://ref.ly/Isa47:9,Isa47:12)). The psalmist writes of the wicked "refusing to hear the tune of the charmer who skillfully weaves his spell." ([Psalms 58:5](https://ref.ly/Ps58:5)).
