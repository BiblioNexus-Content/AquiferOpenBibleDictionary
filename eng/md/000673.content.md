## Baal-Peor (id: 3941)

BAAL\-PEOR
==========

A moabite god worshiped on Mount Peor. 

This god was probably Chemosh, the national deity of Moab. While camped in Shittim, the Israelites were seduced by Moabite women who persuaded them to worship “Baal of Peor” ([Numbers 25:3](https://ref.ly/Num25:3)). For their idolatry, God struck Israel with a plague that killed 24,000 people ([Numbers 25:9](https://ref.ly/Num25:9); [Psalm 106:28](https://ref.ly/Ps106:28-Ps106:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps106:28-Ps106:31)[31](https://ref.ly/Ps106:28-Ps106:31)). Baal\-peor is also the name of the place where Israel worshiped “the Baal of Peor” ([Deuteronomy 4:3](https://ref.ly/Deut4:3)).
