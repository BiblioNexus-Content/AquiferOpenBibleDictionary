## Meaning of Meals in the Bible (id: 6998)

MEANING OF MEALS IN THE BIBLE
=============================

The meal was important in family, social, and religious life. The evening meal was when all family members gathered together, so it was important for bonding. Providing food for travelers was a social and religious duty. Friends would visit to eat with the family and discuss their daily problems. Meals are still important in both Judaism with the Passover meal and in Christianity with the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.

### Types of Meals

In the ancient Near East, people ate two meals a day. The first was at noon, eaten in the field by workers. It consisted of small cakes, flat loaves, figs, olives, and possibly goats' cheese or curds. This was a small meal, eaten to take a break from the heat and work ([Ruth 2:14](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:14)). People in Bible times did not usually eat breakfast. The Bible only mentions morning meals a few times ([Judges 19:5](https://ref.ly/Judg19:5); [John 21:12](https://ref.ly/John21:12)).

In Israel, the evening meal was the most important social event of the day. Workers would return home to relax and enjoy the meal with their family. This meal happened at sunset when it was too dark to work.

### What Did People Eat?

An average meal included bread or cakes made from hand\-ground grain, goats’ cheese or curds, and vegetables like beans, lentils, leeks, peas, figs, olives, raisins, and dates. Meat was available but a luxury for most people. Food was cooked in olive oil and sweetened with honey.

### How Did People Eat Their Meals?

Families ate together, usually seated on the floor with a mat for a table ([Genesis 37:25](https://ref.ly/Gen37:25)). Later, they adopted Canaanite customs and used chairs and small tables ([1 Kings 13:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:20); [Psalm 23:5](https://ref.ly/Ps23:5); [Ezekiel 23:41](https://ref.ly/Ezek23:41)). The Egyptian custom of eating in a reclined position became popular until the Roman period. On special occasions, music, dancing, and riddles were provided for family and guests.

By New Testament times, dining rooms would sometimes be in a separate room upstairs. Guests reclined on their left elbow to eat and talk easily. At important meals, people sat in a set order, from the most important person to the least important (compare [Genesis 43:33](https://ref.ly/Gen43:33); [1 Samuel 9:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:22); [Matthew 23:6](https://ref.ly/Matt23:6); [Mark 12:39](https://ref.ly/Mark12:39); [Luke 14:8](https://ref.ly/Luke14:8)). The place of honor was to the right of the servant as they entered the room. The least important place was on the servant’s left.

Guests washed their hands before and after meals. They ate stew from a common bowl. The stew could have meat, vegetables, or both. Pieces of bread would scoop the stew from the bowl. Usually, there was only one main dish, so the cook could eat with the guests in a communal meal.

### Meals in the New Testament

Jesus often shared meals with his disciples and friends. He and his followers were guests at the wedding feast held in Cana of Galilee ([John 2:1–10](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:10)), and also at a dinner given by Matthew ([Matthew 9:10](https://ref.ly/Matt9:10)). They were also guests at another dinner given by Simon the Pharisee ([Luke 7:36–50](https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50)). Jesus was entertained at dinner somewhat unexpectedly by Zacchaeus ([19:6–7](https://ref.ly/Luke19:6-Luke19:7)). On several occasions Jesus was a guest at a family gathering held at the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus in Bethany ([Luke 10:38–42](https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42); [John 12:2](https://ref.ly/John12:2)). Following the customs of smaller towns and villages, people who passed by the house may well have called in to greet Jesus and perhaps talk with other guests.

### Important Religious Meals

There are two important meals described in Scripture. One involves the old covenant and the other the new covenant (covenants are promises between God and his people). Both meals had a redemptive meaning for the people of God. The first was the institution of the Passover at the time of Israel’s departure from Egypt under Moses ([Exodus 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)). The second was the institution of the Lord’s Supper. Both are discussed in detail in separate articles.

There were other meals that were important in the Bible. For example, the Israelites often ate meals to celebrate God when they brought their sacrifices ([Deuteronomy 14:24–26](https://ref.ly/Deut14:24-Deut14:26)). The Bible also speaks of a day when there will be a great feast in the kingdom of God ([Isaiah 25:6](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6); [Luke 14:25](https://ref.ly/Luke14:25); [Revelation 19:9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:9)).
