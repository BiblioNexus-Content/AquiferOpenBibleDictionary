## Pillar of Fire and Cloud (id: 7737)

PILLAR OF FIRE AND CLOUD
========================

The Pillar of Fire and Cloud is one of the most common ways God appeared to humans in the Old Testament. It is a visual sign of God's presence, especially in stories about the exodus from Egypt, the Sinai covenant, the Israelites' time in the wilderness, and the dedication of the temple.

Descriptions in the Bible
-------------------------

The Bible describes this phenomenon in different ways:

* The pillar of cloud and fire ([Exodus 14:24](https://ref.ly/Exod14:24))
* Pillar of cloud ([Exodus 33:9](https://ref.ly/Exod33:9-Exod33:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod33:9-Exod33:10)[10](https://ref.ly/Exod33:9-Exod33:10); [Numbers 14:14](https://ref.ly/Num14:14))
* Pillar of fire ([Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21); [Numbers 14:14](https://ref.ly/Num14:14))
* Cloud ([Exodus 40:34](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)[35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35); [Deuteronomy 1:33](https://ref.ly/Deut1:33))
* Fire ([Deuteronomy 1:33](https://ref.ly/Deut1:33); [4:12](https://ref.ly/Deut4:12))

The Concept of Shekinah
-----------------------

Although the Bible does not use the term "Shekinah," this word is often used in Christian theology to describe the cloud and other appearances of God (theophanies). "Shekinah" comes from rabbinic literature and refers to God's visible glory.

Roles of the Cloud Theophany
----------------------------

The cloud theophany had several roles, all as a visible expression of God's presence:

1. The cloud filled the tabernacle and stayed there day and night, showing God's presence ([Exodus 40:34](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)[38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)). God appeared in the cloud on the Day of Atonement ([Leviticus 16:2](https://ref.ly/Lev16:2)). When the temple was dedicated, the cloud showed God's acceptance of it as His dwelling place ([1 Kings 8:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)[11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11); [2 Chronicles 5:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:13-2Chr5:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:13-2Chr5:14)[14](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:13-2Chr5:14)).
2. The cloud protected Israel during the exodus. It positioned itself between the Egyptian and Israelite armies, bringing darkness to the Egyptians and light to the Israelites ([Exodus 14:19](https://ref.ly/Exod14:19-Exod14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod14:19-Exod14:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Exod14:19-Exod14:20)). The psalmist remembered how God “spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night” ([Psalm 105:39](https://ref.ly/Ps105:39)).
3. The cloud guided Israel during their journey through the wilderness. “The LORD went before them in a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place before the people” ([Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21-Exod13:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21-Exod13:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21-Exod13:22)). When the cloud lifted, the Israelites moved; when it settled, they camped ([Numbers 9:17](https://ref.ly/Num9:17)). Despite the people's sins, God continued to lead them ([Deuteronomy 1:33](https://ref.ly/Deut1:33)). Later generations remembered that God guided them day and night ([Nehemiah 9:12, 19](https://ref.ly/Neh9:12,Neh9:19); [Psalm 78:14](https://ref.ly/Ps78:14)).
4. The cloud served as a way for God to speak ([Psalm 99:7](https://ref.ly/Ps99:7)). He spoke from the cloud at Sinai ([Exodus 19:9, 16](https://ref.ly/Exod19:9); [34:1–25](https://ref.ly/Exod34:1-Exod34:25); [Deuteronomy 4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Deut4:11-Deut4:12); [5:22](https://ref.ly/Deut5:22)) during moments of rebellion ([Exodus 16:10](https://ref.ly/Exod16:10); [Numbers 14:10](https://ref.ly/Num14:10); [16:42](https://ref.ly/Num16:42-Num16:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Num16:42-Num16:43)[43](https://ref.ly/Num16:42-Num16:43)), when Aaron and Miriam fought with Moses ([Numbers 12:1](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:15)[15](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:15)), and when the 70 elders were chosen. Only Moses had direct access to God's words, when he went to the tabernacle, “the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and the LORD would speak with Moses” ([Exodus 33:9](https://ref.ly/Exod33:9)). At Moses' death, God appeared in the pillar of cloud to speak about the nation's future ([Deuteronomy 31:14](https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:29)[29](https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:29)).

Similar Theophanies
-------------------

Other appearances of God are associated with clouds, fire, and light: 

* Ezekiel saw an immense cloud with flashing lightning and brilliant light ([Ezekiel 1:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:4)). Inside, he saw fire, creatures serving God, God's throne, and God's presence ([Ezekiel 1:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:5-Ezek1:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:5-Ezek1:28)[28](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:5-Ezek1:28)). He also saw the glory of God leaving and later returning to the temple ([Ezekiel 10](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1-Ezek10:22); [43](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:27)).
* Daniel saw “One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven" to receive authority, glory, and power ([Daniel 7:13](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13)). Jesus often referred to himself as the "Son of Man" in the Gospels.
* During the Transfiguration, clouds enveloped Jesus as he revealed his glory ([Matthew 17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [Mark 9:7](https://ref.ly/Mark9:7); [Luke 9:34](https://ref.ly/Luke9:34)).
* Jesus was received into the clouds at his ascension, and angels reminded the apostles of his promise to return the same way ([Acts 1:9](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11); see [Matthew 24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30); [Mark 13:26](https://ref.ly/Mark13:26); [Luke 21:27](https://ref.ly/Luke21:27); [Revelation 1:7](https://ref.ly/Rev1:7)).
