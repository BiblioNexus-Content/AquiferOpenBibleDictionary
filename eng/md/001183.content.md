## Carrion Vulture (id: 4438)

CARRION VULTURE
===============

Another name for the Egyptian vulture (*Neophron percnopterus*) in [Leviticus 11:18](https://ref.ly/Lev11:18) and [Deuteronomy 14:17](https://ref.ly/Deut14:17). The King James Version calls it the gier eagle. The Berean Standard Bible translates it as “osprey” in these verses, likely meaning the Egyptian vulture, not the modern fish\-eating osprey.

*See* Birds; Vulture.
