## Beth-Aven (id: 4158)

BETH\-AVEN
==========

1. A town in the tribal land of Benjamin, located west of Michmash on the border of the wilderness, near Ai, to the east of Bethel ([Joshua 7:2](https://ref.ly/Josh7:2); [18:12](https://ref.ly/Josh18:12); [1 Samuel 13:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:5); [14:23](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:23)).
2. Hosea used this word to mock Bethel, which was an ancient center of worship. The “House of God” (Bethel) had become a “house of wickedness” (Beth\-aven or just Aven; [Hosea 4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15); [5:8](https://ref.ly/Hos5:8); [10:5](https://ref.ly/Hos10:5)).
