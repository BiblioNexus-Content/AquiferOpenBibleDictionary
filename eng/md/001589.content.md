DIKLAH
======

Son of Joktan in the list of nations descended from Noah’s sons ([Gn 10:27](https://ref.ly/Gen10:27); [1 Chr 1:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:21)); perhaps the name refers to an Arabian tribe or territory, living in or near a palm\-bearing area, as the name suggests (Diklah is a variant of the Hebrew word dikla*,* which means date tree or palm tree).
