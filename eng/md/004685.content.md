## Raphon (id: 7947)

RAPHON
======

A town where Judas Maccabeus and his troops defeated the Syrian commander Timothy ([1 Macc 5:37–43](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:37-1Macc5:43)). It was near Carnaim, and since Carnaim is the same as Ashteroth\-karnaim (the modern Sheikh Sa’ad), Raphon is probably er\-Rafeh on the Nahr el\-Ehreir.

* **Associated Passages:** 1MA 5:37–1MA 5:43
