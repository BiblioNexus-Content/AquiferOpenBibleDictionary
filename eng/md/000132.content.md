## Adonikam (id: 3392)

ADONIKAM
========

The head of a family whose descendants returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the Babylonian exile ([Ezra 2:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:13); [Nehemiah 7:18](https://ref.ly/Neh7:18)). Ezra says that 666 members of Adonikam’s family returned, but Nehemiah says the number is 667 (which agrees with [1 Esdras 5:14](https://ref.ly/1Esd5:14)). This is probably a scribal variation.
