## Migron (id: 7127)

MIGRON
======

Site where Saul rested under a pomegranate tree, near Gibeah ([1 Sm 14:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:2)); also mentioned as part of the line of march of the Assyrians ([Is 10:28](https://ref.ly/Isa10:28)). The first reference is to a site south of Michmash, the second is probably north of Michmash. Some scholars, however, try to identify both with the site south of Michmash, though this is doubtful.

* **Associated Passages:** 1SA 14:2; ISA 10:28
