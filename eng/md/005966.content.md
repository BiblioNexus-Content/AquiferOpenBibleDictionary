## Zibeon (id: 9211)

ZIBEON
======

Ancestor of Oholibamah, the Canaanite wife of Esau ([Gn 36:2, 14](https://ref.ly/Gen36:2,Gen36:14)). He is listed as a Hivite in [Genesis 36:2](https://ref.ly/Gen36:2) but is probably the same as Zibeon the son of Seir the Horite ([Gn 36:20, 29](https://ref.ly/Gen36:20,Gen36:29); [1 Chr 1:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38)). Possibly “Hivite” designated his tribal affiliation, while “Horite” indicated the fact that he dwelt in caves. It is also possible that “Hivite” is a transmission error in [Genesis 36:2](https://ref.ly/Gen36:2).
