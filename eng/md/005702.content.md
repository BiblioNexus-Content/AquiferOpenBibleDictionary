## Uel (id: 8952)

UEL
===

Uel was a priest who came from Bani's family. He lived during the time when the Jewish people had returned from being forced to live in Babylon (called the exile). Ezra, a Jewish leader, told Uel and others to divorce their non\-Jewish wives because these marriages went against God's law ([Ezra 10:34](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:34)).
