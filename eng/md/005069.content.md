## Shekinah (id: 8332)

SHEKINAH
========

A word that means “the one who dwells” or “that which dwells.” *Shekinah* is a Hebrew word written in English letters (transliteration). This term became part of Christian teaching through ancient Jewish writings called the "Targums" and rabbinic texts. These texts used *shekinah* to describe how God, who exists beyond our world, is also present within it. 

Shekinah in the Old Testament
-----------------------------

The word "*shekinah*" itself does not appear in the Bible, but the idea comes from many places in the Old Testament where God lives among his people ([Genesis 9:27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:27); [Exodus 25:8](https://ref.ly/Exod25:8); [29:45–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:45-Exod29:46); [Numbers 5:3](https://ref.ly/Num5:3); [1 Kings 6:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:13); [Psalms 68:16–18](https://ref.ly/Ps68:16-Ps68:18); [74:2](https://ref.ly/Ps74:2); [Isaiah 8:18](https://ref.ly/Isa8:18); [Ezekiel 43:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:7-Ezek43:9); [Joel 3:17, 21](https://ref.ly/Joel3:17,Joel3:21); [Zechariah 2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Zech2:10-Zech2:11)). These passages show that while God lives in heaven, he also lives on earth with his people.

People also use the term "*shekinah* *glory*" to describe how God showed himself visibly to the Israelites. It was a visible manifestation of God as a pillar of fire and smoke. This presence was seen:

* at Sinai ([Exodus 19:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:16-Exod19:18)),
* in the wilderness ([Exodus 40:34–38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:38)), and
* in the temple ([1 Kings 6:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:13); [8:10–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:13); [2 Chronicles 6:1–2](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:1-2Chr6:2)).

Shekinah in the New Testament
-----------------------------

The New Testament also talks about God's presence among people, even though it does not use the word *shekinah*. In the New Testament, when God is present, there is often light and glory ([Luke 2:9](https://ref.ly/Luke2:9); [9:29](https://ref.ly/Luke9:29); [Acts 9:3–6](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3-Acts9:6); [22:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:11); [26:12–16](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:16); [2 Peter 1:16–18](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:16-2Pet1:18)). 

The Gospel of John especially focuses on glory and on God living with people. It tells us that when Jesus (called "the Word") became human, he lived among people who saw his glory ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)). The Spirit of God remained on him ([John 1:32](https://ref.ly/John1:32)) and would be with his followers forever ([John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16)). He would abide in those who abide in Jesus ([John 15:4–10](https://ref.ly/John15:4-John15:10)). John wrote about these same ideas in his letters, too. He often talked about how believers live in Christ and how Christ lives in them ([1 John 2:6, 14, 24, 27–28](https://ref.ly/1John2:6,1John2:14,1John2:24,1John2:27-1John2:28); [3:6, 14–15, 24](https://ref.ly/1John3:6,1John3:14-1John3:15,1John3:24); [2 John 1:9](https://ref.ly/2John1:9)).

Paul also identifies Jesus as the *shekinah* of God. All of God's essence and nature lives fully in Jesus in physical form ([Colossians 1:19](https://ref.ly/Col1:19); [2:9](https://ref.ly/Col2:9)). When Christ lives in his church, this makes his followers into God's people ([Colossians 1:15–23](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:23)). Paul described his message as "the gospel of the glory of Christ." He explained that God made his light shine to help people understand "the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" ([2 Corinthians 4:4–6](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4-2Cor4:6)). 

Finally, book of Hebrews says that Jesus is “the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature” ([Hebrews 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3)).
