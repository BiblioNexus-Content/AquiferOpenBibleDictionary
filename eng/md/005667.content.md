TREE
====

A tree is a plant with a woody stem called a trunk. Most trees have branches and leaves.

The Bible mentions many kinds of trees, such as olive, palm, and cedar. Trees were important for food, shelter, tools, and building. They also appear often in symbols and stories in the Bible ([Genesis 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gen2:9); [Psalm 1:3](https://ref.ly/Ps1:3); [Revelation 22:2](https://ref.ly/Rev22:2)).
