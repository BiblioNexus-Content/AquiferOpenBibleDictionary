## Atharim (id: 3861)

ATHARIM
=======

The place where the Israelites tried to enter Canaan and were attacked by the king of Arad in Atharim ([Numbers 21:1](https://ref.ly/Num21:1)). The name means “tracks” and is believed to be located near Tamar, or Hazazon\-tamar, several miles south of the Dead Sea. One possible reading of the text makes it the same as Tamar. The King James Version follows the Targum (an Aramaic translation of the Old Testament) and Vulgate (a Latin translation of the Bible) and translates it as “spies.”
