## Hiram (id: 5860)

HIRAM
=====

1. A king of Tyre who ruled during the time of King David and King Solomon. After David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital, Hiram sent cedarwood, masons, and carpenters to build his palace ([2 Samuel 5:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:11); [1 Chronicles 14:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:1)). Hiram remained David’s friend throughout his life ([1 Kings 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1)). After David's death, he continued that friendship with Solomon. When Solomon was ready to build the temple, Hiram provided wood from the forests of Lebanon, gold, and skilled craftsmen to help build and furnish the temple. In return, Solomon gave Hiram wheat and oil for his household. Moreover, Solomon gave Hiram 20 cities in Galilee. But the Bible tells us that Hiram was not pleased with them ([1 Kings 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs5:11); [9:10–14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:10-1Kgs9:14)).

    Although the Israelites were not a seafaring people, Solomon kept a fleet of ships at Ezion\-geber ([1 Kings 9:26–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28)). Hiram helped Solomon by providing sailors and perhaps ships to make Solomon's fleet work properly. The Phoenicians were known as excellent sailors who traveled the Mediterranean Sea as far west as Tarshish in Spain.

    Hiram was probably the son of Abibal. He ruled in Tyre for 34 years and died at the age of 53\. Phoenician historians record that Solomon married Hiram's daughter.

2. A craftsman from Tyre who worked on Solomon’s temple. He was said to be the son of a man of Tyre and a woman from the tribe of Naphtali ([1 Kings 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:13-1Kgs7:14)). But [2 Chronicles 2:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:14) says that his mother was from “the daughters of Dan.” It is possible her ancestors were from the tribe of Dan (compare [Exodus 38:23](https://ref.ly/Exod38:23)). He created various furnishings for the temple:

    * 2 bronze pillars
        * the decorative capitals (tops) that adorned the pillars
        * the large bronze basin called the "molten sea" and the 12 bronze oxen it stood on
        * 2 smaller basins with their stands
        * shovels, pots, and other containers
        His name is also spelled Huram in [2 Chronicles 4:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:11). He is called Huram\-abi (abi meaning “master”) in [2 Chronicles 2:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:13) and [4:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:16).
