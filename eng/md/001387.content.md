## Consecration (id: 4637)

CONSECRATION
============

Consecration refers to separating persons, utensils, buildings, or places from non\-religious uses in order to dedicate them for holy or sacred purposes. 

What Is the Meaning of “Consecration” in the Bible?
---------------------------------------------------

In the Bible, consecration was indicated by an appropriate rite or vow. Some Hebrew words imply “separation” ([Exodus 13:2](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2); [Leviticus 8:10–12](https://ref.ly/Lev8:10-Lev8:12); [Deuteronomy 15:19](https://ref.ly/Deut15:19)), some imply “dedication” ([Leviticus 21:12](https://ref.ly/Lev21:12); [Numbers 6:9](https://ref.ly/Num6:9)), other words imply “ordination” (literally, “filling the hand,” [Exodus 28:41](https://ref.ly/Exod28:41); [1 Kings 13:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:33)). The New Testament has fewer references to consecration, but they frequently are related to the idea of holiness ([John 10:36](https://ref.ly/John10:36); [1 Corinthians 7:14](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:14); [1 Timothy 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:5)).

How Do Different Traditions Understand Consecration?
----------------------------------------------------

In church practice, especially among denominations with formal leadership structures, consecration describes the special ceremonies that establish a bishop in their role. It is also used to describe: 

* the dedication of holy places,
* containers for holy objects,
* cathedrals (large, important churches that serve as the main church of a bishop),
* elements of the Divine Liturgy or Mass (the bread and wine used during Communion services), or
* buildings set apart for church\-related functions.

Protestant teaching emphasizes the idea of the priesthood of every believer. So all Christians are considered “saints.” The word “saints” has the same root word as “consecration.” It refers to those people who have devoted their lives to God. 

In Orthodox and Roman Catholic teaching, the church officially consecrates or “canonizes” great Christians as saints after they die. This honor is given to those who demonstrated especially holy lives.

Why Is Consecration Important to the Christian Life?
----------------------------------------------------

Consecration is important as it relates to both God and to the world. The apostle Paul defines the term in [Romans 12:1–2\.](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2) He emphasizes that consecration involves people offering their lives symbolically as sacrifices to God. The importance of consecration as it relates to people and things is a basic theme in the first letter of the apostle Peter. Each Christian is meant to daily live as a “holy” and “royal” priesthood for the glory of God ([1 Peter 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9)). Christians consider it an important mark of spiritual maturity to consecrate their own personalities as the Holy Spirit assists them.
