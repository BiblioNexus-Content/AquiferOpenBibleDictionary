## Michael (id: 7109)

MICHAEL
=======

The name Michael means "Who is like God?" Ten different men named Michael appear in the Bible, and also one who is described as an archangel.

1. The father of one of the spies sent by Moses into Canaan ([Numbers 13:13](https://ref.ly/Num13:13)).
2. A Gadite named in the lists of those who settled in the land of Bashan ([1 Chronicles 5:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:13-1Chr5:14)).
3. A second Gadite named Michael is also named in the list ([1 Chronicles 5:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:13-1Chr5:14)).
4. A forefather of Asaph, a temple singer in the days of David ([1 Chronicles 6:40](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:40)).
5. The chief man of Issachar in the temple lists ([1 Chronicles 7:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:3)).
6. A Benjamite named in the temple lists ([1 Chronicles 8:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:16)).
7. A man from Manasseh who joined David in Ziklag when he was fleeing from Saul ([1 Chronicles 12:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:20)).
8. The father of Omri, a top political officer in the days of King David ([1 Chroncles 27:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:18)).
9. The son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah ([2 Chroncles 21:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:2)).
10. The father of Zebadiah, a man who returned with Ezra to Jerusalem after the exile to Babylon ([Ezra 8:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:8)).
11. An angel who appears in the Old Testament, the New Testament, and in Jewish writings from the time between these two parts of the Bible. [Daniel 10:13](https://ref.ly/Dan10:13) says that "the prince of the kingdom of Persia" sought to oppose the purpose of God. Michael, "one of the chief princes," fought against this evil spirit at the Lord’s side ([Daniel 10:21](https://ref.ly/Dan10:21)). His conflict on behalf of Israel is referred to further in [Daniel 12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1).

    The book of Enoch describes Michael as one of four or of seven special angels called "archangels" (Enoch 9:1 and 40:9 list four; 20:1–7 list seven). In the book of Enoch, the War Scroll of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and other intertestamental literature, Michael is described as a warrior who fights for the cause of the righteous or as the protector of Israel.

    The book of Jude tells us about a time when Michael argued with the devil about what would happen to Moses's body after Moses died ([Jude 1:9](https://ref.ly/Jude1:9); compare [2 Peter 2:10–11](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:10-2Pet2:11); see also the reference to "the archangel" in [1 Thessalonians 4:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:16)). This story comes from "The Assumption of Moses" (a writing that told stories about what happened to Moses after he died).

    The only other reference to Michael in the New Testament is [Revelation 12:7–8:](https://ref.ly/Rev12:7-Rev12:8) "Then a war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But the dragon was not strong enough, and no longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels."
