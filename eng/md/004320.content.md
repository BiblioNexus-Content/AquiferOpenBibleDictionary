## Paralysis, Paralytic, Paralyzed (id: 7579)

PARALYSIS, PARALYTIC, PARALYZED
===============================

Paralysis is a symptom of a disease of the central nervous system. A paralytic experiences temporary or permanent loss of sensation and/or voluntary muscle control in one or more areas of the body. In the case of permanent loss, an affected individual is paralyzed. 

This degenerative condition was considered incurable. A few cases of paralysis are mentioned in the New Testament. All occur in connection with Christ’s healing ministry.

Paralytics sought Jesus’s healing in Galilee ([Matthew 4:24](https://ref.ly/Matt4:24)). Some paralytics were among the sick at Bethesda in Jerusalem ([John 5:3](https://ref.ly/John5:3)). Philip cured some paralytics in Samaria ([Acts 8:7](https://ref.ly/Acts8:7)). Luke described the paralyzed servant of the centurion as very sick and at the point of death ([Luke 7:2](https://ref.ly/Luke7:2)). This man was probably the victim of an often\-fatal form of paralysis that begins in the legs and spreads upward through the rest of the body. 

The paralytic at Capernaum was most likely suffering from paraplegia, a paralysis of the lower half of the body ([Matthew 9:2, 6](https://ref.ly/Matt9:2,Matt9:6); [Mark 2:3–10](https://ref.ly/Mark2:3-Mark2:10); [Luke 5:18, 24](https://ref.ly/Luke5:18,Luke5:24)). This disease may have come from an injury at birth or from damage to the spinal cord. Aeneas, whom Peter healed at Lydda, may also have suffered from paraplegia ([Acts 9:33](https://ref.ly/Acts9:33)).
