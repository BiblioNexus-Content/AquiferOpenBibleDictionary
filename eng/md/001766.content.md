## Eliphaz (id: 5018)

ELIPHAZ
=======

1\. Oldest son of Esau and his wife Adah ([Gn 36:4–16](https://ref.ly/Gen36:4-Gen36:16); [1 Chr 1:35–36](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:35-1Chr1:36)). He was the ancestor of a number of Edomite clans.

2\. One of Job’s friends, called the Temanite (see [Jer 49:7](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7)). Teman was traditionally associated with wisdom; hence Eliphaz’s speech depicts the orthodox view of sin and punishment. His three addresses ([Jb 4](https://ref.ly/Job4:1-Job4:21), [15](https://ref.ly/Job15:1-Job15:35), [22](https://ref.ly/Job22:1-Job22:30)) failed to grapple with the essence of Job’s problem because he assumed previous major sin in Job’s life.
