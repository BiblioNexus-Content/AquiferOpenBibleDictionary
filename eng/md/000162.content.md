## Agia (id: 3422)

AGIA
====

Jaddus’s wife, who is mentioned in the Apocrypha as a descendant of Barzillai the Gileadite ([1 Esdras 5:38–39](https://ref.ly/1Esd5:38-1Esd5:39); see also [2 Samuel 19:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:31-2Sam19:40)–[40](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:31-2Sam19:40)). 

Her sons had become priests. But when the Jewish people came back from exile in Babylon, Agia's sons were not allowed to serve as priests anymore. The other Jews asked for proof that they were from a priestly family. These men could not give this proof ([Ezra 2:61](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:61-Ezra2:63)–[63](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:61-Ezra2:63); [Nehemiah 7:63](https://ref.ly/Neh7:63-Neh7:65)–[65](https://ref.ly/Neh7:63-Neh7:65)).
