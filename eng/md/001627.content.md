## Doeg (id: 4878)

DOEG
====

Doeg was an official who worked for King Saul. Saul commanded him to kill the innocent priests at Nob ([1 Samuel 21–22](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam22:23)). Doeg was an Edomite. which means he was either a foreigner who converted to the Israelite religion or a prominent leader from Edom who was captured during Saul's military campaign against the Edomites ([14:47](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47)). 

Saul put Doeg in charge of his flocks of animals ([21:7\).](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7) King David also later had a foreigner in charge of his cattle ([1 Chronicles 27:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:30)). 

The Bible does not clearly explain why Doeg was at the sanctuary at Nob ([1 Samuel 21:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7)). He might have been there for a religious purpose. If he was going through a purification process, this may have forced him to stay here (like a Nazirite vow described in [Numbers 6:13](https://ref.ly/Num6:13)). Another possibility is that he was hiding there as a spy for King Saul.

What we do know is that while at Nob, Doeg saw the priests welcome David and give him food and a weapon—the sword of Goliath ([1 Samuel 21:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:9)). A short time later, Doeg had opportunity to report this to Saul ([22:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:10); [Psalm 52 title](https://ref.ly/Ps52:1)). He hoped to demonstrate his loyalty with this report. 

Doeg's character is revealed when he brutally killed the priests and all the people living in the city of Nob ([1 Samuel 22:18–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:18-1Sam22:19)). This cruel action suggests he was not truly an Israelite, even if he lived among them.
