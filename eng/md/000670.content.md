## Baali (id: 3939)

BAALI
=====

A Hebrew title meaning “my lord” or “my master” ([Hosea 2:16](https://ref.ly/Hos2:16)). 

The title was rejected by God because it was associated with the Canaanite Baal. God chose to be called *’ishi,* “my husband.” The meaning of the two terms were similar but was not associated with pagan practices. In a prophetic play on words, God stressed his covenantal love for his people and rejected any implication that he the same for Israel as Baal was for the Canaanites. 

*See* Baal (Idol); God, Names of.
