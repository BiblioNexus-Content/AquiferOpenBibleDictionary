## Mount Nebo (id: 7329)

MOUNT NEBO
==========

The name of a high mountain on the east side of the Jordan River opposite the city of Jericho. The Israelites encamped near it on the last stage of their journey to the promised land ([Deuteronomy 32:49](https://ref.ly/Deut32:49)). The mountain now identified as Nebo has two peaks. The Old Testament name of the peak of Nebo is "Pisgah" ([34:1](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1)). From this high place, Moses saw the land God had promised to give to Israel (verses [1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1-Deut34:5)).
