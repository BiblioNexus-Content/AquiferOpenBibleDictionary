GOLDSMITH
=========

A goldsmith was a skilled worker who made things from gold. Some made expensive idols (false gods) for people to worship ([Isaiah 40:19](https://ref.ly/Isa40:19); [41:7](https://ref.ly/Isa41:7); [46:6](https://ref.ly/Isa46:6); [Jeremiah 10:9, 14](https://ref.ly/Jer10:9,Jer10:14); [51:17](https://ref.ly/Jer51:17)). Others created holy items and gold coverings for the tabernacle and Solomon’s temple ([Exodus 31:4](https://ref.ly/Exod31:4); [35:32](https://ref.ly/Exod35:32); [1 Kings 6:20–35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:20-1Kgs6:35)). After the people of Israel returned from exile in Babylon, the goldsmiths formed a special group of workers. They helped fix and restore the temple in Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 3:8, 31–32](https://ref.ly/Neh3:8,Neh3:31-Neh3:32)).
