## Beard (id: 4048)

BEARD
=====

The hair growing on the lower part of a man’s face. 

A beard was worn as a sign of maturity among people from the ancient Near East, including the Israelites. In Israel, care of the beard was religiously significant ([Leviticus 19:27](https://ref.ly/Lev19:27)). The laws in Leviticus commanded priests to not shave their heads or clip their beards ([Leviticus 21:5](https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Lev21:5-Lev21:6)). David sent messengers to an Ammonite king, who were humiliated by having one side of their beards shaved off by the Ammonites. That insult, and others, led to war ([2 Samuel 10:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8)[8](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:8)). 

It was sometimes appropriate to shave one’s beard. If someone may have had leprosy on the head or face, they had to shave around the spot to verify ([Leviticus 13:29](https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37)[37](https://ref.ly/Lev13:29-Lev13:37)). A shaven head, wailing, and wearing sackcloth were ways to signal future doom ([Isaiah 15:1](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa15:3)). Ezra acted out Israel’s spiritual disaster by pulling hair out of his head and beard ([Ezra 9:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:3)).
