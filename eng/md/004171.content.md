## Northeaster (id: 7427)

NORTHEASTER
===========

A name given to the stormy wind of [Acts 27:14](https://ref.ly/Acts27:14). Paul encountered the northeaster on his journey to Rome. Against Paul's advice, the ship left a harbor near Lasea. They sailed close to the coast of Crete as a gentle breeze pushed them along. Probably when they were less than 14\.5 kilometers (9 miles) from shore, a sudden violent storm threatened their small boat. 

Luke, who wrote Acts, calls this storm a typhoon (in the King James Version it is called a "tempestuous wind"). The name of this wind was Euroclydon, which means "the southwest wind that stirs up waves."
