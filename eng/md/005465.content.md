## Tamar (Person) (id: 8727)

TAMAR (Person)
==============

1. The wife of Er, the firstborn son of Judah by a Canaanitess. Later, as a widow, Tamar bore two sons to Judah named Perez and Zerah ([Genesis 38:6–24](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:24); [1 Chronicles 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4)). Tamar continued the line of Judah through Perez ([Ruth 4:12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:12)), and her name is recorded in the family list of Christ ([Matthew 1:3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:3)).

2. Sister of Absalom and the daughter of David by his wife Maacah, the Geshurite. Through deceit, Tamar was seduced by Amnon, her half\-brother. Her full brother, Absalom, got revenge and had Amnon murdered at Baal\-hazor ([2 Samuel 13](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam13:39); [1 Chronicles 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:9)).
3. Daughter of Absalom, who was noted for her beauty ([2 Samuel 14:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:27)). She perhaps married Uriel of Gibeah and became the mother of Maacah.
