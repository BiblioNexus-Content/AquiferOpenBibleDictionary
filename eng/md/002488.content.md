## Hazor-Hadattah (id: 5741)

HAZOR\-HADATTAH
===============

One of the cities located in the southern extremity of Judah, near the border of Edom ([Jos 15:25](https://ref.ly/Josh15:25)). The kjv translates the term as two different cities, “Hazor and Hadattah.” The Aramaic adjective “Hadattah” indicates this as a settlement from Hazor, but this is unsure.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 15:25
