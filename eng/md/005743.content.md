## Uzziel (id: 8992)

UZZIEL
======

1. The youngest son of Kohath from the tribe of Levi. Uzziel became the leader of the Uzzielite family group within the larger Kohathite clan ([Exodus 6:18](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18); [Numbers 3:19, 27, 30](https://ref.ly/Num3:19,Num3:27,Num3:30); [1 Chronicles 26:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:23)). He was the uncle of Aaron, and his sons Mishael and Elzaphan carried the bodies of Nadab and Abihu outside the camp after they disobeyed Aaron's authority ([Exodus 6:22](https://ref.ly/Exod6:22); [Leviticus 10:4](https://ref.ly/Lev10:4)). Several of his descendants were important in Israel's history. Amminadab led the ceremony when David moved the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 15:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:10)). Micah and Isshiah were leaders among the Levites during King Solomon's reign ([1 Chronicles 23:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:20))
2. The son of Ishi who was one of the leaders of the Simeonite warriors. These warriors defeated the Amalekites at Seir during the time when Hezekiah was king ([1 Chronicles 4:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:42)). This was an important victory because the Amalekites had not been completely defeated earlier by King Saul or King David. As a result of this victory, the Simeonites were able to take over and live in that land.
3. A Benjaminite clan chief who is listed as the son of Bela, the son of Benjamin ([1 Chronicles 7:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:7)).
4. The son of Heman of the Levite clan of Asaph ([1 Chronicles 25:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:4)). He is also called Azarel ([1 Chronicles 25:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:18)).
5. A Levite who helped with the reconsecration (the ceremony to make holy again) of the temple during King Hezekiah's time ([2 Chronicles 29:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14)). He is listed as the son of Jeduthun.
6. A goldsmith who worked on rebuilding the gates of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Neh3:8)). His name suggests he was probably a priest who had the job of making and repairing the instruments and containers used in the temple (compare [1 Chronicles 9:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:29)).
