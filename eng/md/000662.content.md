## Baalath-Beer (id: 3928)

BAALATH\-BEER
=============

A place\-name meaning “mistress” or “lady of the well.” Like the male version of *Baal,* Baalath often appears as part of place names. The name may suggest that the Canaanite goddess Baalath, patron of Byblos, was connected with the place or well in some way. Baalath\-beer was the name of a town in the tribe of Simeon. The name is also given as: 

* Baal or Baalath ([1 Chronicles 4:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:33))
* Ramah of the Negev ([Joshua 19:8](https://ref.ly/Josh19:8))
* Ramoth of the Negev ([1 Samuel 30:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:27))

It may have been on the southern border of Simeon’s tribal land.
