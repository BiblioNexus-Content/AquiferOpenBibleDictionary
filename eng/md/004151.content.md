## Nisroch (id: 7411)

NISROCH
=======

The god of King Sennacherib, in whose temple at Nineveh the king was assassinated by Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons ([2 Kgs 19:37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:37); [Is 37:38](https://ref.ly/Isa37:38)). Nisroch was the city god of Nineveh, the chief capital of the Assyrian Empire; he was perhaps identical with the Assyrian god Nusku.
