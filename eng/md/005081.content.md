## Shem (id: 8357)

SHEM
====

The eldest son of Noah ([Genesis 5:32](https://ref.ly/Gen5:32); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Gen6:10); [7:13](https://ref.ly/Gen7:13); [9:18, 23, 26](https://ref.ly/Gen9:18,Gen9:23,Gen9:26-Gen9:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen9:18)[27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:18,Gen9:23,Gen9:26-Gen9:27); [11:10](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10); [1 Chronicles 1:4, 17](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:4,1Chr1:17-1Chr1:27)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:4)[27](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:4,1Chr1:17-1Chr1:27); [Luke 3:36](https://ref.ly/Luke3:36)) and the ancestor of the Semitic peoples ([Genesis 10:1, 21](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1,Gen10:21-Gen10:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1)[31](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1,Gen10:21-Gen10:31)). Shem lived 600 years ([Genesis 11:10](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:11)). His name in Hebrew means “name,” possibly suggesting that Noah believed Shem’s name would become significant.

After the great Flood, Shem and his brother Japheth found their father, Noah, drunk. Their other brother, Ham, had dishonored him. Shem and Japheth acted respectfully toward Noah ([Genesis 9:20–29](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:29)). Because of their actions, Noah later cursed Canaan, Ham’s son, and blessed both Shem and Japheth.

[Genesis 11:10](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:27) shows the family line of the promised seed (descendant). This descendant was foretold in [Genesis 3:15](https://ref.ly/Gen3:15) and [5:1](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1-Gen5:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1-Gen5:32)[32](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1-Gen5:32) to crush Satan. It goes through Shem to Abraham, then through Judah and David to Christ (compare [Luke 3:36](https://ref.ly/Luke3:36)). The blessing Noah gave to Shem shows that his line would carry the promise of the seed from [Genesis 3:15](https://ref.ly/Gen3:15). This is the first time in the Bible that God is called the God of a specific person or group. Noah had said that Canaan's people would serve Shem's people. This came true when the Israelites, who were Shem's descendants, took control of Canaan's land (compare [1 Kings 9:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21)[21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:20-1Kgs9:21)).

Noah also said that Japheth's descendants would grow in number and live among Shem's people ([Genesis 9:27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:27)). This likely means that Japheth's descendants would grow in number. Over time, they would benefit from Shem's blessings. Some scholars believe this prophecy was fulfilled when, in the New Testament, the gentiles were invited to share in the gospel's blessings and the church's founding.

In the “table of nations” recorded in [Genesis 10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32), five descendants of Shem are listed: 

1. Elam
2. Asshur
3. Arphaxad
4. Lud
5. Aram

Receiving particular emphasis among these descendants is Eber from the line of Arphaxad, whose line is traced to Abraham in [Genesis 11:16](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:27).
