## Wilderness of Sin (id: 8522)

WILDERNESS OF SIN
=================

A dry, sandy region in the southwest part of the Sinai peninsula. The Bible tells us it was located "between Elim and Sinai" ([Exodus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1)). It is mentioned only four times in the Bible in the descriptions of the journey of the exodus from Egypt ([Exodus 16:1](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Exod17:1); [Numbers 33:11–12](https://ref.ly/Num33:11-Num33:12)). The wilderness of Sin is located southeast of Elim, which is generally thought to be the Wadi Gharandel.
