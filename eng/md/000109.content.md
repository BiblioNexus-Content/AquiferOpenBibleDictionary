## Addan (id: 3369)

ADDAN
=====

A city in Persia. Some Jewish people who had been forced to live away from their homeland during exile in Babylon came back from Addan to Jerusalem with Ezra ([Ezra 2:59](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:59)). It was probably named after a Babylonian god called Addu. Some exiles from this city could not prove their Jewish descent because they lost their family records. It is also spelled Addon ([Nehemiah 7:61](https://ref.ly/Neh7:61)).
