COPPERSMITH
===========

A person who used bronze and copper to make tools, implements, and ornaments ([Exodus 26:11, 37](https://ref.ly/Exod26:11,Exod26:37); [27:2–10](https://ref.ly/Exod27:2-Exod27:10); [Joshua 6:19, 24](https://ref.ly/Josh6:19,Josh6:24); [1 Samuel 17:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:5-1Sam17:6); [2 Samuel 8:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:8)). The term “coppersmith” is only used in the New Testament ([2 Timothy 4:14](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:14)). However, the occupation was important throughout the history of the Bible.
