## Baskama (id: 4027)

BASKAMA
=======

A site where Trypho, commander of the Seleucid army, killed his captive, Jonathan Maccabeus. Trypho was holding Jonathan hostage, and when Jonathan was no longer useful, Trypho killed him ([1 Maccabees 12:42–13:23](https://ref.ly/1Macc12:42-1Macc13:23)). 

It is unclear where Baskama is located. The most popular suggestion is modern\-day Tell el\-Jummeizeh (“sycamore tree”), which is near the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee. El\-Jummeizeh might be related to Baskama, which can mean “house of the sycamore.” Ancient ruins there might have been a shrine to Jonathan, a great hero. The Jewish historian Josephus calls the spot Basaca.
