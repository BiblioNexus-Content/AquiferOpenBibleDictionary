## Accho, Acco (id: 3331)

ACCHO, ACCO
===========

A major Palestinian port city from the earliest Canaanite period. The Old Testament mentions that Asher’s tribe failed to drive out the people living in Acco at the time of Israel’s conquest of Canaan ([Judges 1:31](https://ref.ly/Judg1:31)). 

Acco is mentioned often in Middle and New Kingdom Egyptian texts and Assyrian records. Acco was probably controlled by Israel when David was king, and was one of 20 cities given by Solomon to King Hiram of Tyre ([1 Kings 9:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:11-1Kgs9:14)–[14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:11-1Kgs9:14)). Later, Alexander the Great of Macedonia captured Acco. It was eventually rebuilt and renamed Ptolemais ([Acts 21:7](https://ref.ly/Acts21:7)).
