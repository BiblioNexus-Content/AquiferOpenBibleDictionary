## Kinah (id: 6585)

KINAH
=====

Town in the Negev of Judah ([Jos 15:22](https://ref.ly/Josh15:22)), perhaps named after the Kenites who lived in the area ([Jgs 1:16](https://ref.ly/Judg1:16)). According to a letter discovered at Arad, troops were sent from Kinah to reinforce Ramoth\-negev against an Edomite attack. The ancient name is preserved in Wadi el\-Qeini, in the eastern Negev.
