## Psychics (id: 7844)

PSYCHICS
========

Psychics are people who claim to have contact with supernatural forces and say they can interpret what these forces want. The Old Testament groups psychics with “mediums.” These were people who claimed to enable communication between supernatural forces and human beings. The Scriptures clearly prohibit the people of God to use the services of psychics or mediums ([Leviticus 19:31](https://ref.ly/Lev19:31); [20:6, 27](https://ref.ly/Lev20:6,Lev20:27)).
