## Seir (Person) (id: 8211)

SEIR (Person)
=============

Father of seven sons and a descendant of Abraham through the family line of Esau. First Seir was a Horite tribe living in the land of Edom. The nation that descended from Seir was first expelled by the descendants of Esau. But later they intermarried with them. This may be why the ancestry of Abraham includes Seir and his descendants ([Genesis 36:20–21](https://ref.ly/Gen36:20-Gen36:21); [1 Chronicles 1:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38)).

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 1:38; GEN 36:20–GEN 36:21
