## Born Again (id: 4309)

BORN AGAIN
==========

"Born again" is a phrase Jesus used to explain to Nicodemus how a person enters the kingdom of God ([John 3:3–7](https://ref.ly/John3:3-John3:7)). Jesus said that to enter the kingdom of God, a person must be born again. This means they need a new kind of life from God. It is not a physical birth. It is a spiritual change that comes from God’s Spirit.
