CHANNELS OF THE SEA
===================

Valleys or stream beds in the ocean floor. The Lord saved David from all his enemies and King Saul. Then David praised the great power of God. This power could expose the ocean floor with a blast of his breath ([2 Samuel 22:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:16); [Psalm 18:15](https://ref.ly/Ps18:15)).
