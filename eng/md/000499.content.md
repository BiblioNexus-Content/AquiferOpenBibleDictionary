## Arsaces (id: 3765)

ARSACES
=======

A title shared by Parthian rulers beginning with Arsaces I, founder of the kingdom (possibly in 250 BC). The Parthian kingdom under Arsaces VI (Mithridates I) grew to include Media and Persia among other nations. 

This growth brought the Parthians close to Seleucid territory. Syrian king Demetrius Nicator retaliated in 141 BC by invading the kingdom of Arsaces VI, an event recorded in the Apocrypha ([1 Maccabees 14:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Macc14:1-1Macc14:3)). Arsaces was one of the kings advised by the Roman consul not to harm the Jews ([1 Maccabees 15:15–22](https://ref.ly/1Macc15:15-1Macc15:22)).
