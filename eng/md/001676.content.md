## Eber (id: 4927)

EBER
====

1. Abraham’s ancestor ([Genesis 10:21–25](https://ref.ly/Gen10:21-Gen10:25); [11:14–17](https://ref.ly/Gen11:14-Gen11:17); [1 Chronicles 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:18-1Chr1:25); [Luke 3:35](https://ref.ly/Luke3:35)). The word “Hebrew” may come from his name. Eber lived 464 years and was the ancestor of the “sons of Eber,” a phrase which may refer to the “Hebrews.” In the same passage “sons of Heth” equals the “Hittites” ([Genesis 23:10](https://ref.ly/Gen23:10)). However, the term “Hebrew” may be a sign of social class rather than of descent from Eber. Eber had a son named Peleg. During Peleg's lifetime, the people on Earth split into two main groups: ones who traveled from place to place (nomads) and ones who stayed in permanent settlements.
2. A Gadite leader during the reigns of Jothan, king of Judah, and Jeroboam II, king of Israel ([1 Chronicles 5:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:13), “Heber” in the King James Version).
3. Benjamite and Elpaal’s descendant ([1 Chronicles 8:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:12)).
4. Benjamite and Shashak’s descendant ([1 Chronicles 8:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:22)).
5. The head of Amok’s priestly family during the days of the high priest Joiakim ([Nehemiah 12:20](https://ref.ly/Neh12:20)).
