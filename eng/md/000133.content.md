## Adoniram (id: 3393)

ADONIRAM
========

An important official in Israel during the reigns of David, Solomon, and Rehoboam ([1 Kings 4:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:6); [5:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:14)). Adoniram is also called: 

* "Adoram", possibly a shortening of his name ([2 Samuel 20:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:24); [1 Kings 12:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:18))
* Hadoram ([2 Chronicles 10:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:18))

While Solomon's temple was being built, Adoniram was in charge of 30,000 workers ([1 Kings 5:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:13-1Kgs5:14)–[14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:13-1Kgs5:14)). David created a system of slave labor that Solomon continued, not only for building the temple but for many other projects.

When Rehoboam became king, the people asked for lower workloads. Instead, Rehoboam decided to increase their workloads ([1 Kings 12:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:15)). When Adoniram went to enforce the king’s rule, the people in rebellion stoned him to death ([1 Kings 12:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:16-1Kgs12:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:16-1Kgs12:19)).
