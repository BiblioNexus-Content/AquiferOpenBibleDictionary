## Tishbe (id: 8867)

TISHBE
======

Native city of Elijah the prophet and its inhabitants ([1 Kgs 17:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1); [21:17, 28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:17,1Kgs21:28); [2 Kgs 1:3, 8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:3,2Kgs1:8); [9:36](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:36)). The Hebrew form of Tishbe in [1 Kings 17:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1) prompted the KJV to translate the word as “of the inhabitants \[of Gilead].” Most translations follow the Septuagint, however, in considering Tishbe a proper noun. This reading is also supported by the fact that Elijah is elsewhere called a Tishbite. If Tishbe is considered a proper name, it is likely identified with Thisbe, a town in Naphtali that is mentioned in [Tobit 1:2](https://ref.ly/Tob1:2).
