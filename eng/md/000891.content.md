## Bethbasi (id: 4162)

BETHBASI
========

A town in the Judean wilderness where Jonathan and Simon Maccabeus hid from General Bacchides. After defending it successfully, they survived an attack from the Syrian forces ([1 Maccabes 9:62](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:62-1Macc9:68)[–](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:62-1Macc9:68)[68](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:62-1Macc9:68)). After that defeat, Bacchides had to make peace with Jonathan ([1 Maccabees 9:69](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:69-1Macc9:73)[–](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:69-1Macc9:73)[73](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:69-1Macc9:73)).
