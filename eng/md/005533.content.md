## Tertullus (id: 8794)

TERTULLUS
=========

Tertullus was the lawyer chosen by the Jewish council (called the Sanhedrin) to speak against Paul during his trial. The Roman governor Felix led the trial in Caesarea ([Acts 24:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts24:1-Acts24:2)). It is not clear whether Tertullus was Roman, Greek, or Jewish. Some people believe he was Jewish because he says “our law” and says that the Roman commander Lysias took Paul from “our hands” (verses [6b–7](https://ref.ly/Acts24:6-Acts24:7)). But the earliest copies of the Bible do not include these parts of the verses. So, we cannot be sure.

Tertullus probably worked as a lawyer in the Roman courts. The Jewish leaders brought him quickly, which suggests he was a trained speaker and legal expert.

In his speech ([Acts 24:2–8](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:8)), Tertullus began by praising Felix. Then he accused Paul of three things: 

* causing trouble in public,
* disturbing the peace, and
* leading the group called the Nazarenes.

All of these were serious crimes under Roman law.
