## Storax Tree (id: 8631)

STORAX TREE, SWEET STORAX
=========================

The storax tree (*Styrax officinalis*) belongs to a group of trees that produce a sweet\-smelling resin. Today, scholars think that the "gum resin" mentioned in [Exodus 30:34](https://ref.ly/Exod30:34) came from the storax tree. It is an irregular shrub or small tree with stiff branches that grows 2\.7 to 6\.1 meters (9 to 20 feet) tall.

This tree is common on low hills and rocky places from Lebanon throughout the Holy Land. Its gum is collected by making cuts in the stems and branches. The resin has a strong, pleasant smell and is still valued today as a perfume.
