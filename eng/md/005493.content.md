TEACHER
=======

Teachers conserved the values and education of a nation and passed them on to each new generation. In Old Testament times the first teachers were often parents ([Deuteronomy 6:7, 20–25](https://ref.ly/Deut6:7,Deut6:20-Deut6:25); [11:19–21](https://ref.ly/Deut11:19-Deut11:21)). Leaders like Moses and Aaron were charged with teaching the people ([Leviticus 10:11](https://ref.ly/Lev10:11)). Later the priests and Levites had a teaching function ([Deuteronomy 24:8](https://ref.ly/Deut24:8); [33:8–10](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8-Deut33:10); [2 Chronicles 17:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7-2Chr17:9); [Ezra 44:23](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:23); [Micah 3:11](https://ref.ly/Mic3:11)). God himself was thought of as a teacher ([Psalms 25:8, 12](https://ref.ly/Ps25:8,Ps25:12); [27:11](https://ref.ly/Ps27:11); [32:8](https://ref.ly/Ps32:8); [86:11](https://ref.ly/Ps86:11); [Isaiah 2:3](https://ref.ly/Isa2:3)).

In the New Testament, the Greek noun for “teacher” and the verb “to teach” are widely used. John the Baptist was called a teacher ([Luke 3:12](https://ref.ly/Luke3:12)). The term is used more than 30 times to refer to Jesus ([Matthew 4:23](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23); [5:2](https://ref.ly/Matt5:2); [7:29](https://ref.ly/Matt7:29); [9:35](https://ref.ly/Matt9:35); [11:1](https://ref.ly/Matt11:1); [Mark 1:21](https://ref.ly/Mark1:21); [2:13](https://ref.ly/Mark2:13); [4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Mark4:1-Mark4:2); [6:2, 6, 34](https://ref.ly/Mark6:2,Mark6:6,Mark6:34); [Luke 4:15, 31](https://ref.ly/Luke4:15,Luke4:31); [5:3](https://ref.ly/Luke5:3); [6:6](https://ref.ly/Luke6:6); [John 6:59](https://ref.ly/John6:59); [7:14, 28](https://ref.ly/John7:14,John7:28); and so on). People recognized his teaching as authoritative ([Matthew 7:29](https://ref.ly/Matt7:29); [Mark 1:22](https://ref.ly/Mark1:22); [Luke 4:32](https://ref.ly/Luke4:32)). Even when Jesus was 12 years old he conversed in a profound way with the teachers of the law in the temple ([Luke 2:46](https://ref.ly/Luke2:46)). These men were often associated with the Pharisees ([5:17](https://ref.ly/Luke5:17)). Gamaliel was a Pharisee and a teacher of the law ([Acts 5:34](https://ref.ly/Acts5:34)). The term “rabbi” was often used to denote teacher. The rabbi was held in great honor. In the early church, the teacher was widely recognized ([Acts 13:1](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1); [1 Corinthians 12:28–29](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28-1Cor12:29); [Ephesians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11); [2 Timothy 1:11](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:11); [James 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1)).
