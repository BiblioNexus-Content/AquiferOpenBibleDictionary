## Adummim (id: 3405)

ADUMMIM
=======

A pass stretching from the hill country into the Jordan Valley and which formed part of Judah's northern border ([Joshua 15:7](https://ref.ly/Josh15:7)). This place also helps locate Geliloth on Benjamin's southern border ([Joshua 18:17](https://ref.ly/Josh18:17)). The road from Jerusalem to Jericho went through this mountain pass. 

Jerome, a church father, believed that this was where Jesus's story of the good Samaritan took place ([Luke 10:30](https://ref.ly/Luke10:30-Luke10:37)–[37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:30-Luke10:37)). The modern Arabic name means "ascent of blood." The Hebrew name Adummim, meaning "red rocks," likely comes from the natural color of the rocks, not from the fate of many travelers who were robbed there.
