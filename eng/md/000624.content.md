## Ayyah (id: 3893)

AYYAH
=====

A town belonging to the tribe of Ephraim mentioned in [1 Chronicles 7:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:28). Ayyah is another name for Gaza, but different from the Philistine Gaza. Some scholars think that the Aija listed in [Nehemiah 11:31](https://ref.ly/Neh11:31) refers to Ayyah or Ai, possibly a neighboring town. Many identify Aiath from [Isaiah 10:28](https://ref.ly/Isa10:28) with Ayyah. It is the modern Khirbet Haiyan.
