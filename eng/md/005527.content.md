## Terah (Person) (id: 8788)

TERAH (Person)
==============

The father of Abram (Abraham), Nahor, and Haran ([Genesis 11:26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:26); [1 Chronicles 1:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:26); [Luke 3:34](https://ref.ly/Luke3:34)). 

Abram is listed first among Terah's sons, but Abram was likely not the oldest. After Terah lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran ([Genesis 11:26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:26)). The New Testament reports that Abram left Haran after his father's death when he was 75 years old ([Genesis 12:4](https://ref.ly/Gen12:4); [Acts 7:4](https://ref.ly/Acts7:4)). 

Terah died at the age of 205 ([Genesis 11:32](https://ref.ly/Gen11:32)). This suggests that Terah was at least 130 when Abram was born. Terah began the trip to Canaan, though he failed to go beyond Haran ([Genesis 11:31](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen11:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen11:32)[32](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen11:32)). Abram was commanded there to leave his family and proceed to Canaan ([Genesis 12:1](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1)).
