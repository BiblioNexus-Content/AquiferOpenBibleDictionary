## Helez (id: 5780)

HELEZ
=====

1. One of the mighty men of King David. He is called a Paltite in [2 Samuel 23:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:26) and a Pelonite in [1 Chronicles 11:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27). Most experts believe "Paltite" is the correct term, meaning he came from Bethpelet. Most scholars think he is the same person who was the officer in charge of the seventh group of soldiers during David's reign ([1 Chronicles 27:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:10)).
2. A descendant of Jerahmeel from the tribe of Judah ([1 Chronicles 2:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:39)).
