## Tongues, Speaking in (id: 8893)

SPEAKING IN TONGUES
===================

Speaking in tongues is when someone speaks in a language they have not learned. This is a special gift from God. The Greek word for this is *glossolalia,* which means "speaking in tongues." It is a combination of the word *laleo* ("to speak") and *glossa* ('tongue").

First Appearance in the Early Church
------------------------------------

The first time people spoke in tongues was on the Day of Pentecost. On this day, the Holy Spirit filled 120 Christians who were meeting together. They began praising God in many different languages they had never learned. People from about 16 different nations who were in Jerusalem could understand what the Christians were saying because each person heard the message (the good news about Jesus) in their own language ([Acts 2:8–11](https://ref.ly/Acts2:8-Acts2:11)). 

Other Times People Spoke in Tongues
-----------------------------------

Later in the book of Acts, other groups of people also spoke in tongues when they received the Holy Spirit ([10:46](https://ref.ly/Acts10:46); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6)). However, not everyone spoke in tongues when they received the Spirit (see [8:15](https://ref.ly/Acts8:15-Acts8:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts2:8-Acts2:11)[17](https://ref.ly/Acts8:15-Acts8:17)). This shows that speaking in tongues was not the only sign that someone had received the Holy Spirit. The Bible teaches that all believers receive the Holy Spirit when they become part of the church, which is called the body of Christ ([1 Corinthians 12:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:13)). The real evidence that the Holy Spirit is working in someone's life is the "fruit of the Spirit" as described in [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts2:8-Acts2:11)[23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23):

Public and Private Use of Speaking in Tongues
---------------------------------------------

In the days of the early church, some Christians spoke in tongues and some did not. Paul taught that an interpreter must be present if speaking in tongues was done publicly in church. If no one could interpret, tongues should be used privately as a way to pray and worship God. In these cases, the person is speaking to themselves and to God ([1 Corinthians 14:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:28)). This is different from speaking in tongues during church meetings, which requires someone to interpret the message for everyone to understand. 

However, under certain conditions described by Paul, speaking in tongues can become one of the spiritual gifts used in ministry to the church for the common good. The primary concern is that speaking in tongues in public should not be reduced to simply praying or speaking without interpretation.

Rules for Speaking in Tongues in Church
---------------------------------------

The apostle Paul gave clear rules about speaking in tongues during church meetings. These rules are meant to ensure that the gift of speaking in tongues serves the church and does not become a way to seek personal fulfillment ([1 Corinthians 14:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27-1Cor14:33)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts2:8-Acts2:11)[33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:27-1Cor14:33)):

1. Only one, two, or three people should speak in tongues during a worship service.
2. These people should speak one at a time, not all at once.
3. Someone must be present who can explain (interpret) what is being said in tongues. If no one can interpret, the person should not speak in tongues during the service.
4. The person speaking in tongues should not be the same person who interprets the message ([1 Corinthians 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10)).
5. If there are too many people speaking in tongues and not enough interpreters, people should pray for the ability to interpret instead ([1 Corinthians 14:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:13)).
6. After someone interprets the tongues into regular language, others should evaluate whether the message agrees with God's truth.
7. People with the gift of discernment (the ability to tell if something is truly from God) should test everything that is said ([1 Corinthians 12:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:10)).

People should always stay in control of themselves during worship. They should not blame unusual behavior on being "carried away by the Spirit." God brings peace and unity, not disorder and confusion.

Paul taught that Christians should not specifically seek the gift of speaking in tongues. Instead, they should desire gifts that help everyone understand God's message clearly ([1 Corinthians 12:31](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:31); [14:1, 5](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1,1Cor14:5)). However, if someone has the gift of tongues, they should not be prevented from using it, as long as they follow these rules and use it to help others.
