## Dayspring, Day Star (id: 4774)

DAYSPRING, DAY STAR
===================

"Dayspring" and "day star" are words used in the King James Version to refer to Venus, the planet that is visible just before sunrise, or to the first light of dawn itself.

* Both [Job 38:12](https://ref.ly/Job38:12) and [Luke 1:78](https://ref.ly/Luke1:78) in the King James Version use the word "dayspring" while the Berean Standard Bible uses the word “dawn.”
* [2 Peter 1:19](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:19) in the King James Version uses the word “day star” while the Berean Standard Bible uses the word "morning star."

In [Isaiah 14:12](https://ref.ly/Isa14:12), “day star” refers to the proud king of Babylon. The King James Version calls him “Lucifer.” This king tried to rise too high and hurt Israel. The verse suggests God will bring him down, just as the morning star fades when the sun rises.
