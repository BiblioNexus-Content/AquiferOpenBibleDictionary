## Nohah (Place) (id: 7423)

NOHAH\* (Place)
===============

Place west of Gibeah in Benjamin’s territory ([Jgs 20:43](https://ref.ly/Judg20:43), rsv). Other translations consider Nohah (meaning “quiet”) an adverb and translate it accordingly, “with ease” (kjv), because no town by that name is known.
