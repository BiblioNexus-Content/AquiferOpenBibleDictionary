## Bithron (id: 4258)

BITHRON
=======

A term in [2 Samuel 2:29](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:29) (King James Version; New Living Translation margin) whose meaning is uncertain. Abner was the commander of the army of Ishbosheth. He fled through Bithron after losing a battle to the army of David. The Hebrew root word means “to cut into pieces.” There are three explanations: 

1. It refers to a valley (possibly the Jabbok).
2. It is the area “cut off” by a great curve in the Jabbok River.
3. It refers to the first part of the day, “all morning” (Berean Standard Bible).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:29
