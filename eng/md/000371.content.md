## Anti-Lebanon (id: 3632)

ANTI\-LEBANON
=============

A mountain range stretching from Mount Hermon in the south toward the north\-northeast ([Judith 1:7](https://ref.ly/Jdt1:7)). It runs parallel to the Lebanon range west of it. Most of the water for the Jordan River comes from water draining from the two mountain ranges. In the Old Testament, the range was known as Sirion ([Deuteronomy 3:9](https://ref.ly/Deut3:9); [4:48](https://ref.ly/Deut4:48); [Psalm 29:6](https://ref.ly/Ps29:6)) or Senir ([1 Chronicles 5:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:23); [Song of Solomon 4:8](https://ref.ly/Song4:8); [Ezekiel 27:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:5)).
