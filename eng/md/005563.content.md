## Theocracy (id: 8813)

THEOCRACY
=========

A form of government where God has the highest political authority. Sometimes, God is represented by a human ruler, such as a king. So, [Deuteronomy 17:14](https://ref.ly/Deut17:14-Deut17:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/Deut17:14-Deut17:20) argues that a human king should only rule if chosen by the Lord.

Development of Theocracy in Israel
----------------------------------

Theocracy (rule by God) developed in ancient Israel over time. The Israelites in Egypt believed that Yahweh, their special God, cared about their suffering. They thought Yahweh wanted to free them from slavery and free them from earthly rulers, especially the pharaoh (ruler of Egypt). The Israelites believed Yahweh wanted them to serve only Him (see [Exodus 3:7](https://ref.ly/Exod3:7-Exod3:10)–[10](https://ref.ly/Exod3:7-Exod3:10); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Exod8:1); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Exod9:1)). 

It is important to understand how life was different under various rulers. Egyptian peasants (poor farmers) experienced harsh treatment under the pharaoh. They faced oppression, unreasonable work demands, and loss of freedom and self\-respect. These difficult conditions were everyday experiences for Egyptian peasants.

In contrast, life under Yahweh's rule came to mean something very different. The Israelites began to associate Yahweh's leadership with freedom, justice, and equality. This was a significant change from their previous experiences.

When the Israelites arrived in Canaan, they found a different kind of leadership than they had seen in Egypt. The young Israelite tribes did not like this new system either. In Canaan, kings usually owned the city\-states (small independent areas) they ruled. These kings often rented out some of the land to the people who lived there.

This was very different from what God wanted for the Israelites. When Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, God's plan was for them to be free. Each tribe was given a specific area of land. God wanted the Israelites to live on this land and only serve him, not any human ruler.

### The Period of the Judges

In the period of the judges, the idea of theocracy was clear and constant. The Israelites were not a unified group, and they did not have one ruler. Instead, Yahweh ruled over them and unified them. This is why Gideon rejected kingship, saying “The LORD shall rule over you” ([Judges 8:23](https://ref.ly/Judg8:23)).

In this period, human leadership was sometimes needed, especially when the tribes were threatened. These rulers, called judges, would be “raised up” to protect the people, and lead the people back to the Lord ([Judges 2:16](https://ref.ly/Judg2:16)). The judges did not bring victory because of their own abilities. Yahweh was given credit for the victory.

### The Period of Monarchy

Samuel was an important leader who lived during a time of change in Israel. He came after the judges and before the first kings of Israel. During this time, the Philistines (a neighboring group) became a big problem for the Israelites. 

For about 200 years before Samuel, the Israelites and Philistines had lived near each other without much fighting. But this changed during Samuel's time. The Philistines started to attack Israel, trying to take over their land. The Israelites had been living under theocratic government. Different tribes of Israelites would work together to defend themselves when needed. But now, this system did not seem strong enough to fight against the Philistines.

Many important Israelites thought they needed a new way to govern themselves. They believed that having a king would make Israel stronger and help them survive. They asked for a king to lead them in battle against their enemies (see [1 Samuel 8:5, 19](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:5,1Sam8:19-1Sam8:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:5,1Sam8:19-1Sam8:20)).

The idea of having a king challenged Israel's belief in theocracy. Many people thought having a king was a good idea. They believed a king could help them in battles and make their nation stronger. But the Israelites had an old tradition of being ruled by God alone. This made the decision very difficult. Samuel, their leader at the time, thought that wanting a king meant rejecting God's rule. He warned the people about the problems a king might bring ([1 Samuel 8:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:10-1Sam8:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:10-1Sam8:18); [10:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:19)). 

However, something unexpected happened. Samuel received a message from God about a man named Saul. God seemed willing to let Saul become king. Samuel was told to anoint Saul (put oil on his head to show God had chosen him) as the first king of Israel ([1 Samuel 9:27–10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:27-1Sam10:1)). 

Then, the Bible tells us that "the spirit of God" came upon Saul ([1 Samuel 11:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:6)). This was similar to how God had empowered the judges who led Israel before. It showed that God was with Saul in a special way.

Saul's position as king was further strengthened when he won a battle against the Ammonites. After this victory, the people cheered for Saul and accepted him as their king. This public approval was the final step in establishing Saul's claim to kingship.

These events showed that Saul's kingship had both God's blessing and the people's support. The Bible tells us that there were different opinions about having a king in Israel. Some people wanted a king, while others thought it might go against God's rule. However, it was clear that God chose the king and told his prophet who to choose.

Theocracy in the Future
-----------------------

The Bible tells about a time when God's people would not need a human king to rule them. [Ezekiel 40–48](https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek48:35)) describes a future where God would rule his people through special priests called Zadokites. This idea began to take shape around 520 BC, with the work of two prophets named Haggai and Zechariah. It became very important for the Jewish people after they returned from exile in Babylon. This new way of thinking changed how the community lived and behaved.

A man named Ezra helped make this idea of God's rule normal for Judaism. After Ezra's time, priests played a big role in the life of the nation. Even though foreign rulers like the Seleucids still had power over the people, the Jewish people looked forward to a different kind of king.

They waited for a special leader called the Messiah (God's chosen one). They believed the Messiah would be from the family of King David. This leader would bring peace and save Israel. He would make the old promises of God come true, bringing justice, goodness, and fairness to everyone.
