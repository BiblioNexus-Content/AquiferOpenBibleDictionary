## Night Hawk (id: 7401)

NIGHT HAWK
==========

The night hawk, also called the goatsucker, is a migratory bird that hunts insects at night. It is dark in color and has short legs. It is similar to the American whippoorwill.

Night hawks belong to the genus *Caprimulgus*. They look like owls, with flat heads, large eyes, and soft feathers. They fly quietly. During the day, they rest on branches. At night, they catch insects while flying.

The name “goatsucker” comes from an ancient belief that these birds drank milk from goats, which is not true.

The Bible lists the night hawk as an unclean bird in the law of Moses ([Leviticus 11:16](https://ref.ly/Lev11:16); [Deuteronomy 14:15](https://ref.ly/Deut14:15)). Some scholars think the text refers to an owl. The Berean Standard Bible the word is translated "screech owl." But many accept the translation “night hawk.”
