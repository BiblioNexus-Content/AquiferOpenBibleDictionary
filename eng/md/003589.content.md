## Magadan (id: 6847)

MAGADAN
=======

A location that Jesus visited after he crossed the Sea of Galilee ([Matthew 15:39](https://ref.ly/Matt15:39)). The correct spelling was most likely Magdala. The only New Testament reference to this town is in the name of Mary *Magdalene.* Magadan had several names:

* Greek sources call it Taricheae, “factories for salting fish” (Strabo 16\.2\.45; Pliny 5\.71\)
* Rabbinic sources call it Migdal Nunnayah or Migdal Sab’aiyah, “Tower of the Fishes/ Dyers”
* It was also called el\-Mejdel

It was about 4\.8 kilometers (three miles) northwest of Tiberias, on the southern end of the great plain of Gennesaret. It was famous for its fertile soil and constant enjoyable climate.
