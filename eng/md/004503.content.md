## Pleiades (id: 7763)

PLEIADES
========

The Pleiades is a constellation (group of stars) that appears in the eastern night sky. While people can usually see six bright stars with their eyes alone, special cameras on telescopes show many more stars in this group. These stars are surrounded by clouds of gas and dust that connect them. In the Bible, God asks Job: “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loosen the belt of Orion?” ([Job 38:31](https://ref.ly/Job38:31)).
