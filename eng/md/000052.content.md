## Abishai (id: 3310)

ABISHAI
=======

King David’s nephew. The son of David's sister Zeruiah (his father is not mentioned) and brother of Joab and Asahel ([1 Chronicles 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16)). 

Abishai went with David to Saul’s camp one night and wanted to kill Saul while he was sleeping, but David stopped him ([1 Samuel 26:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6-1Sam26:12)). He also helped Joab kill Abner, Saul’s general, to avenge the death of their brother, Asahel ([2 Samuel 3:30](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:30)). 

Later, Abishai won a victory over the Edomites ([1 Chronicles 18:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13)–[13](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:12-1Chr18:13)) and was second in command in a decisive battle against the Ammonites ([1 Chronicles 19:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:10-1Chr19:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:10-1Chr19:15)). Abishai was often cruel. For example, he wanted to behead Shimei for insulting David during Absalom’s rebellion, but again, David stopped him ([2 Samuel 16:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5-2Sam16:12); [19:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21-2Sam19:23)–[23](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:21-2Sam19:23)). When King David fled beyond the Jordan, Abishai led one of David’s three divisions that defeated Absalom ([2 Samuel 18:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:15)).

Later, in a battle against the Philistines, Abishai saved David’s life by killing the giant Ishbi\-benob ([2 Samuel 21:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17)–[17](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:15-2Sam21:17)). He was called one of David’s bravest warriors ([2 Samuel 23:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18-2Sam23:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:18-2Sam23:19); [1 Chronicles 11:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21)–[21](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:20-1Chr11:21)).
