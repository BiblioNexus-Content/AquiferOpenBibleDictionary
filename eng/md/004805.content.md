## Ruhamah (id: 8070)

RUHAMAH
=======

One of two symbolic names showing God’s altered perspective toward Israel from one of hostility to one of mercy. God’s attitude of displeasure was symbolized by the name Lo\-ruhamah (meaning “Not pitied”), which Hosea named his daughter. God had withdrawn his compassion from Israel because of their great sin ([Hos 1:6, 8](https://ref.ly/Hos1:6,Hos1:8)). His new attitude of mercy was portrayed by the name Ruhamah (meaning “She has obtained pity”), revealing God’s revived spirit of compassion that was to be poured out on Israel ([2:1, 23](https://ref.ly/Hos2:1,Hos2:23)).
