## Ephah (Person) (id: 5101)

EPHAH (Person)
==============

1\. Son of Midian, an offspring of Abraham through his concubine Keturah ([Gn 25:4](https://ref.ly/Gen25:4); [1 Chr 1:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:33)). Isaiah mentions him as a gold trader ([Is 60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6)). Some manuscripts mention two sons of Midian with the same name, Ephah, but that is an error of misspelling.

2\. Caleb’s concubine, who bore him three sons ([1 Chr 2:46](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:46)).

3\. Jahdai’s son from Judah’s tribe ([1 Chr 2:47](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:47)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 25:4; 1CH 1:33; 1CH 2:46; 1CH 2:47; ISA 60:6
