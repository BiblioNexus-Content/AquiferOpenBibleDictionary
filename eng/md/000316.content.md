## Amram (id: 3579)

AMRAM
=====

1. Kohath’s son. He was a member of Levi’s tribe. Amram married Jochebed and had three famous children: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam ([Exodus 6:16–20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16-Exod6:20); [Numbers 26:58–59](https://ref.ly/Num26:58-Num26:59)). During the Israelites’ wilderness journey, the Amramites had a special responsibility. They were in charge of caring for the ark of the covenant and the table, lampstand, altars, and other furnishings used in the tabernacle ([Numbers 3:27, 31](https://ref.ly/Num3:27,Num3:31)). Later, the Amramites were one of the groups in charge of offerings placed in the temple treasury ([1 Chronicles 26:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:23-1Chr26:24)).
2. A priest from Bani’s family. He obeyed Ezra’s strong advice to divorce his non\-Jewish wife after the exile to Babylon ([Ezra 10:34](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:34)).
3. The King James Version uses this as a form of Hamran to identify Dishon’s son, in [1 Chronicles 1:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:41). Hamran itself is an alternate form of Hemdan (compare [Genesis 36:26](https://ref.ly/Gen36:26)). *See* Hemdan.
