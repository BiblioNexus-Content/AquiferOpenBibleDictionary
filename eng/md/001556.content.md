## Demas (id: 4806)

DEMAS
=====

One of the coworkers of the apostle Paul. Demas was with him once when Paul was imprisoned. There is little known about Demas apart from the brief information given in the New Testament. At first, he supported the ministry of Paul. He was mentioned in the greetings of Paul to the Colossians in [Colossians 4:14](https://ref.ly/Col4:14). He was also mentioned [Philemon 1:24](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:24). However, in [2 Timothy 4:10](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10) Paul says Demas abandoned him because of Demas's love for the present world.
