## Magor-Missabib (id: 6858)

MAGOR\-MISSABIB\*
=================

Name given by Jeremiah to Pashhur, the chief officer in the house of the Lord. Jeremiah did this because Pashhur put him in stocks for prophesying judgment upon Judah ([Jer 19:14–20:2](https://ref.ly/Jer19:14-Jer20:2)). The name Pashhur means “prosperity round about” and was changed to “terror on every side” ([20:3](https://ref.ly/Jer20:3)) because Pashhur was to see the horrors of the Babylonian invasion.
