## Apollonius (id: 3665)

APOLLONIUS
==========

Name of probably four different men in the ancient Jewish texts about the Maccabean revolt.

1. Apollonius of Tarsus, the son of Menestheus ([2 Maccabees 3:5–7](https://ref.ly/2Macc3:5-2Macc3:7); [4:4](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:4)). The Greek historian Polybius identifies him as this governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia. He served under Seleucus IV. He retired to Miletus when Antiochus IV began to rule. Apollonius used his skill in diplomacy when he served as ambassador to Egypt ([2 Maccabees 4:21](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:21)). His son was also named Apollonius (\#4 below). His son served as governor under Demetrius II.
2. Apollonius, a cruel captain of the Mysians sent by Antiochus IV to kill all adult Jewish males ([1 Maccabees 1:29](https://ref.ly/1Macc1:29); [2 Maccabees 5:24](https://ref.ly/2Macc5:24)). He was killed by Judas Maccabeus ([1 Maccabees 3:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Macc3:10-1Macc3:12)).
3. Apollonius, Gennaeus’s son. He was a governor who along with other local leaders continued to harass the Jews ([2 Maccabees 12:2](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:2)).
4. Apollonius, the grandson of Menestheus. In 147 BC, he began to serve as governor of Coelesyria. His father also had this role. He was appointed by Demetrius II. This Apollonius led forces against Jonathan Maccabeus. Jonathan moved faster than Apollonius and defeated his army. Apollonius fled ([1 Maccabees 10:69–85](https://ref.ly/1Macc10:69-1Macc10:85)).
