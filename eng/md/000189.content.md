## Ahiman (id: 3448)

AHIMAN
======

1. One of Anak’s three sons. The Ahimanites were one of the Anakim clans (a race of giants) living in Hebron when the 12 Israelite spies gathered information about the land of Canaan ([Numbers 13:22](https://ref.ly/Num13:22); [Josua 15:13](https://ref.ly/Josh15:13-Josh15:14)–[14](https://ref.ly/Josh15:13-Josh15:14); [Judges 1:10](https://ref.ly/Judg1:10)).
2. A Levite who worked as a gatekeeper in Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 9:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:17)). This was after the time when many Jewish people had been forced to live far from their homeland and then allowed to return.
