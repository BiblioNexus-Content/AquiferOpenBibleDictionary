## Epaphroditus (id: 5098)

EPAPHRODITUS
============

Leader in the Philippian church. Epaphroditus was sent to the apostle Paul during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment; his mission was to deliver gifts ([Phil 4:18](https://ref.ly/Phil4:18)) and to assist the apostle in his work ([2:25](https://ref.ly/Phil2:25)). While in Rome, Epaphroditus became seriously ill and nearly died. After a period of convalescence, he returned to Philippi with Paul’s letter instructing the church to receive him (v [29](https://ref.ly/Phil2:29)). Epaphroditus’s devoted service endeared him to the Philippian believers and to Paul, who termed him “brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier” (v [25](https://ref.ly/Phil2:25), rsv).
