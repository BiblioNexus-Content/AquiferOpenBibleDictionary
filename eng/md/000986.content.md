## Bithiah (id: 4257)

BITHIAH
=======

Mered’s wife. Bithiah may have been a princess, or the phrase “daughter of Pharaoh” (kjv) may merely indicate that she was Egyptian ([1 Chr 4:17–18](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:17-1Chr4:18)). Her name (meaning “daughter of Yah”) seems to indicate that she was a Jewish convert.
