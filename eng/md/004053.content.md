## Nathan (id: 7313)

NATHAN
======

1. The son of David with Bathsheba, the third son to be born in Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 5:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:14); [1 Chronicles 3:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:5); [14:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:4)). Nathan was Solomon’s older brother. He appears in the apocalyptic oracle (prophecy about the future) of [Zechariah 12:12\.](https://ref.ly/Zech12:12) He is also a part of the family line of Jesus, through Joseph ([Luke 3:31](https://ref.ly/Luke3:31)).

2. One of the early prophets and advisers of David. As David's military campaigns neared an end, he told Nathan of his wish to build a home for God. Nathan initially reacted favorably. But, after receiving direct orders from the Lord, he withdrew his approval. He foretold that one of David's sons would build God a house. God would establish a dynasty for David through his son Solomon. The prophecy includes not only the Davidic line but also the messianic king. Nathan's oracle was vital. It dealt with two great institutions: the temple and the Davidic monarchy ([2 Samuel 7:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:7)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:7)[7](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:1-2Sam7:7); [1 Chronicles 17:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr17:1-1Chr17:15)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr17:1-1Chr17:15)[15](https://ref.ly/1Chr17:1-1Chr17:15)).

    During a war with the Ammonites, David had a child with a woman named Bathsheba, who was not his wife. David tried to hide what he had done. He tried to get Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, to go home to her ([2 Samuel 11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:13)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:13)[13](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:13); [23:39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:39)). When this did not work, he had Joab, the army's general, arrange for Uriah to be killed in battle. After that, David took Bathsheba as his wife ([2 Samuel 11:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:27)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:27)[27](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:14-2Sam11:27)).

    A prophet named Nathan came to talk to David. Nathan was brave. He told David a story (parable) about a rich man who took a poor man's only sheep. This story made David very angry at the rich man ([2 Samuel 12:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:9)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:9)[9](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:1-2Sam12:9)). Then Nathan told David that he was like the rich man in the story. Nathan helped David see how bad his actions were and told him what would happen because of his sin ([2 Samuel 12:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:10-2Sam12:12)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:10-2Sam12:12)[12](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:10-2Sam12:12)). This prophecy was fulfilled through a rape, the deaths of three of David’s sons, and civil war ([2 Samuel 13–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam18:33); [1 Kings 1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:53)). Bathsheba’s child also would not live ([2 Samuel 12:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:14)).

    When David was near death, one of his sons, Adonijah, seized power ([1 Kings 1:1, 10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1,1Kgs1:10)). Nathan urged Bathsheba to remind David of a promise. It concerned Solomon's succession. He supported her by intervening in time ([1 Kings 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:10-1Kgs1:27)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:10-1Kgs1:27)[27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:10-1Kgs1:27)). David immediately approved Solomon’s crowning ([1 Kings 1:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:28-1Kgs1:53)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:28-1Kgs1:53)[53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:28-1Kgs1:53)).

    Nathan was an important historian ([1 Chronicles 29:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:29); [2 Chronicles 9:29](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:29)). He and David played a vital role in developing the music for temple worship ([2 Chronicles 29:25](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:25)).

3. A man from Zobah and the father of Igal, one of David’s 30 heroes ([2 Samuel 23:36](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:36)). He was possibly the Nathan noted as the brother of Joel ([1 Chronicles 11:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:38)).
4. The father of two important court officials ([1 Kings 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:5)). He is probably either the prophet or David’s son.
5. A descendant of Judah, in the clan of Jerahmeel, the son of Attai and the father of Zabad ([1 Chronicles 2:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:36)).
6. A delegation sent by Ezra to secure Levitical reinforcements for the Israelites returning to Jerusalem ([Ezra 8:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:16)). Nathan might be among those who promised to divorce their foreign wives ([Ezra 10:39](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:39)). But, "Nathan," meaning "gift," was a very common name.
