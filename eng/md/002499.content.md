## Heavenlies, the (id: 5752)

HEAVENLIES\*, The
=================

Term unique to Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians, also translated “heavenly places” or “realms,” and referring to the super earthly upper regions of the air. Since the term “in the heavenlies” carried with it associations from pagan cultic vocabulary, it was perhaps used by the apostle in an apologetic manner.

“The heavenly places” indicates the sphere where the risen Christ has been seated at the right hand of God in a position of authority, power, and dominion, reigning as conqueror and ruler high above the heavenly world ([Eph 1:20–21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:21)). Other usage points to the idea of the realized hope of those who are in Christ, in that believers have already been blessed with “every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies” (v [3](https://ref.ly/Eph1:3)) and are raised with Christ, seated with him in the heavenlies ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Eph2:6)). The church will make known the wisdom of God to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies ([3:10](https://ref.ly/Eph3:10)). She will thus participate in the victory over the spiritual hosts of wickedness, also present in the heavenly places ([6:12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:12)).
