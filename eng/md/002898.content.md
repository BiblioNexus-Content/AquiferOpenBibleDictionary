## Jabin (id: 6151)

JABIN
=====

1\. King of Hazor who led a coalition against Joshua at Merom. Jabin and his allies were destroyed in the battle, and Hazor was burned to the ground ([Jos 11:1–14](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1-Josh11:14)).

2\. King of Hazor during the period of the judges ([Jgs 4](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24)). God allowed him to oppress Israel for 20 years because of their wickedness. His army included 900 chariots of iron. Eventually, God delivered Israel through the prophetess Deborah and her captain, Barak, who defeated Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army. While resting after his flight from battle, Sisera himself was killed by a woman. Jabin was no longer a threat after Sisera’s death and was soon killed ([Jgs 4:24](https://ref.ly/Judg4:24); [Ps 83:9](https://ref.ly/Ps83:9)).
