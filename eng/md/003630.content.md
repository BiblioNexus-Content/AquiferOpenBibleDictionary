## Makkedah (id: 6888)

MAKKEDAH
========

One of the Shephelah towns conquered during the southern campaign led by Joshua ([Jos 10:10–29](https://ref.ly/Josh10:10-Josh10:29); [12:16](https://ref.ly/Josh12:16)). It belonged to the same district as Lachish ([15:41](https://ref.ly/Josh15:41)). Eusebius placed it eight Roman miles east of Eleutheropolis (Beth\-guvrin), which would lead to Beit\-Maqdum, a Roman\-Byzantine ruin beside the Roman road from Eleutheropolis to Hebron. The biblical site may have been at Khirbet el\-Qom about one\-half mile (.8 kilometer) to the southwest.
