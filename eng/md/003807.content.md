## Meremoth (id: 7066)

MEREMOTH
========

1\. Priest, son of Uriah, grandson of Hakkoz ([Ezr 8:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33); [Neh 3:4, 21](https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21)). The family of Hakkoz was unable to prove its descent; therefore, they were excluded from the priesthood. Meremoth appears to be an exception. He weighed silver and gold (a priestly function \[[Ezr 8:24–30](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:24-Ezra8:30)]), repaired part of the Jerusalem wall ([Neh 3:4, 21](https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21)), and sealed the covenant ([10:5](https://ref.ly/Neh10:5)).

2\. Priest and Bani’s son, who severed ties with his foreign wife and children at Ezra’s request ([Ezr 10:36](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:36)).

3\. Priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:3](https://ref.ly/Neh12:3)) and established the house of priests called Meraioth in [Nehemiah 12:15](https://ref.ly/Neh12:15) (though some identify the two references as the same person).
