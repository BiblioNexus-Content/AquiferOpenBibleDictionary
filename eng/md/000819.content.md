## Believers (id: 4089)

BELIEVERS
=========

The people who believe. In the New Testament, it specifically refers to people who believe in Jesus as Lord and follow him ([Acts 5:14](https://ref.ly/Acts5:14)). 

One would expect the term “believers” (sometimes translated as “faithful”) to be a title for Christians since the New Testament stresses belief in Jesus. Although New Testament authors emphasized believing, they rarely used the term “believer” as a name for Christians. 

There are a few clear examples of "believer" being used as a name for Christians in [Acts 4:32](https://ref.ly/Acts4:32), [10:45](https://ref.ly/Acts10:45), [19:18](https://ref.ly/Acts19:18), and [1 Timothy 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:12). But in other places, the term is a description, not a name ([Acts 2:44](https://ref.ly/Acts2:44); [15:5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5); [18:27](https://ref.ly/Acts18:27); [1 Timothy 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3)). As a name, “believer” points to the personal commitment of Christians to Jesus. Christians were called not merely to believe something but to give themselves to someone.
