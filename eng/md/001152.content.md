## Candace (id: 4407)

CANDACE
=======

A title given to ancient Ethiopian queens. Philip, a leader in the early church, met and baptized an Ethiopian eunuch who was a minister under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians ([Acts 8:27](https://ref.ly/Acts8:27)). That particular Candace ruled over Nubia (modern Sudan) from AD 25 to 41\. Her name was probably Amanitere.
