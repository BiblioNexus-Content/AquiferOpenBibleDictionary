## Suicide (id: 8647)

SUICIDE
=======

The act of taking one’s own life on purpose and without being forced. The word “suicide” does not appear in most Bible translations. [John 8:22](https://ref.ly/John8:22) in the New Living Translation is an exception to this. The Old Testament records suicides by Saul and his armor bearer in [1 Samuel 31:3–6](https://ref.ly/1Sam31:3-1Sam31:6), Ahitophel in [2 Samuel 17:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:23), and Zimri in [1 Kings 16:15–19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:15-1Kgs16:19). Judas Iscariot is the only suicide victim mentioned in the New Testament ([Matthew 27:3–5](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:5)).

The Bible does not clearly say that suicide is wrong. But, it sees suicide as a sign of moral failure. People often think about suicide when they feel very guilty or have lost something important to them. Saul had lost his sanity, his stability, and then his three sons on the battlefield. He then ended his life. Ahitophel was once a trusted counselor, but his desire for power destroyed him. When Absalom refused Ahitophel's plot against David, Ahitophel felt ashamed. He went home, made arrangements for after his death, and hanged himself. 

Judas Iscariot also hung himself. His suicide was even sadder than Ahitophel's. Judas was one of the twelve disciples and he betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Then he deeply regretted what he had done. He returned the money to the Jewish leaders, saying “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood” ([Matthew 27:3–4](https://ref.ly/Matt27:3-Matt27:4)). Judas hanged himself which showed his deep regret.
