## Chios (id: 4531)

CHIOS
=====

A rocky, mountainous island in the east\-central part of the Aegean Sea. During Paul's third missionary journey, his ship anchored opposite Chios between stops at Mitylene and Samos as he traveled to Jerusalem ([Acts 20:15](https://ref.ly/Acts20:15)). Although the island was not very fertile, Chios was known for producing wine, figs, and gum mastic. The island is separated from the mainland by a strait that is 8 kilometers (5 miles). In Paul's time, the main city on the island, also called Chios (modern Scio), was a free city in the Roman province of Asia.
