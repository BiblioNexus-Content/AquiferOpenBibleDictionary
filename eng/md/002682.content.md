## House of the Archives (id: 5931)

HOUSE OF THE ARCHIVES\*
=======================

Building used for storage of records, annals, and decrees; a common structure in Near Eastern nations in the second millennium BC ([Ezr 5:17–6:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:17-Ezra6:1)). In the archives at Ecbatana, a summer resort for Persian kings, King Darius (521–486 BC) found an edict of Cyrus (559–530 BC) that entitled the Jews to begin reconstruction of the Jerusalem temple following the exile ([Ezr 6:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:2)). On the basis of that edict, Darius gave his support to renewed reconstruction efforts, which had been halted for 16 years due to local opposition (cf. [Hg 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1); [Zec 1:1](https://ref.ly/Zech1:1)).
