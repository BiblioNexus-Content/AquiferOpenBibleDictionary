TRYPHAENA, TRYPHENA
===================

A Christian woman of Rome. Along with Tryphosa, Paul called her one of the women “who have worked hard in the Lord” ([Romans 16:12](https://ref.ly/Rom16:12)). These two women may have been sisters. Or, they may have both served as leaders (called deaconesses) in the church.
