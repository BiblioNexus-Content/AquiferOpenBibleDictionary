## Abijah (id: 3301)

ABIJAH
======

1. Samuel’s second son. He and his older brother, Joel, were corrupt judges in Beersheba. Because of their corruption, Israel’s leaders demanded to be ruled by a king ([1 Samuel 8:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:2); [1 Chronicles 6:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:28)).
2. The son of King Jeroboam I of the northern kingdom of Israel. The boy’s illness led his family to seek guidance from the prophet Ahijah at Shiloh ([1 Kings 14:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:1-1Kgs14:2)–[2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:1-1Kgs14:2)).
3. An alternate name for Abijam, king of Judah, in [2 Chronicles 12:16–14:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:16-2Chr14:1) and [Matthew 1:7](https://ref.ly/Matt1:7).
