## Harim (id: 5671)

HARIM
=====

1\. Priest whom King David appointed to official duties in the temple ([1 Chr 24:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:8)).

2\. Ancestor of a Jewish family who returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:32](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:32); [Neh 10:5](https://ref.ly/Neh10:5)). Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women ([Ezr 10:31](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:31)), but they divorced their wives and a representative of the clan signed Ezra’s covenant ([Neh 10:27](https://ref.ly/Neh10:27)).

3\. Ancestor of a family of priests who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:39](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:39); [Neh 7:42](https://ref.ly/Neh7:42)). Some identify him with \#1 above. Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women.

4\. Ancestor of Malkijah. Malkijah repaired a section of the Jerusalem wall during Nehemiah’s time ([Neh 3:11](https://ref.ly/Neh3:11)). This Harim could be the same as \#2 above.

5\. Priest who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:3](https://ref.ly/Neh12:3); Hebrew “Rehum,” see nlt mg). His son (or grandson) Adna is listed as a leading priest during the high priesthood of Joiakim ([12:15](https://ref.ly/Neh12:15)). Later, under Ezra, a representative of the family (probably related to \#3 above) signed the covenant of faithfulness to God ([10:5](https://ref.ly/Neh10:5)).
