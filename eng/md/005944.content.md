## Zerah (id: 9190)

ZERAH
=====

1. One of the chiefs of the Edomites ([Genesis 36:17](https://ref.ly/Gen36:17); [1 Chronicles 1:37](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:37)). He is the son of Reuel, Esau’s son by his wife Basemath. He was likely the ancestor of Jobab, who later became king of the Edomites ([Genesis 36:13, 33](https://ref.ly/Gen36:13,Gen36:33)).
2. One of the twin sons of Judah by his daughter\-in\-law Tamar ([Genesis 38:30](https://ref.ly/Gen38:30); [46:12](https://ref.ly/Gen46:12); [Matthew 1:3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:3)). Although Zerah thrust out his hand first, he drew it back, allowing his brother, Perez, to be born first. The descendants of Zerah (the Zerahites) became one of the most influential clans of Judah ([Numbers 26:20](https://ref.ly/Num26:20); [Joshua 7:1, 18](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1,Josh7:18); [22:20](https://ref.ly/Josh22:20); [1 Chronicles 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4-1Chr2:6)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4-1Chr2:6)[6](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4-1Chr2:6); [9:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:6)). Because Ethan and Heman are listed as sons of Zerah in [1 Chronicles 2:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6), the Ezrahites mentioned in [1 Kings 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31) and the titles to [Psalms 88](https://ref.ly/Ps88:1-Ps88:18) and [89](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52) are also considered to be Zerahites. However, Ethan and Heman are listed as Levites in [1 Chronicles 15:17\.](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17) It is more likely that the Ezrahites were a Levite clan.
3. One of the sons of Simeon from whom the Zerahite clan descended ([Numbers 26:13](https://ref.ly/Num26:13); [1 Chronicles 4:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:24)). He is also called Zohar in [Genesis 46:10](https://ref.ly/Gen46:10) and [Exodus 6:15](https://ref.ly/Exod6:15).
4. One of the sons of Iddo, from the Gershonite branch of Levi’s tribe ([1 Chronicles 6:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:21)).
5. One of the ancestors of Asaph from Levi’s tribe. He is the son of Adaiah and the father of Ethni ([1 Chronicles 6:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:41)). Several believe him to be the same individual as \#4 above.
6. The commander of the Ethiopians (Cushites) who fought against Asa, king of Judah ([2 Chronicles 14:9](https://ref.ly/2Chr14:9)). It is hard to identify this person or the event with any certainty. The most common identification has been with Usarkon II of Egypt. The battle account matches Usarkon's reign in Egypt. So do the troops' numbers and nationalities.
