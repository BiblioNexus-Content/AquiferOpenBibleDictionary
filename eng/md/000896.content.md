## Beth-Eden (id: 4167)

BETH\-EDEN
==========

A small Aramean (Syrian) state north of Damascus. Assyria conquered Beth\-eden and forcibly sent its people to Kir ([2 Kings 16:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9)). This fulfilled the prediction in [Amos 1:5](https://ref.ly/Amos1:5) (“house of Eden” in the King James Version). Beth\-eden, which means “house of delight,” is connected to the Eden that is listed in [Ezekiel 27:23\.](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:23) We do not know where it was. Its inhabitants are referred to as the “people of Eden” in [2 Kings 19:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:12).
