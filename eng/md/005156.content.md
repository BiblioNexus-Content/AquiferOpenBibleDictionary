## Shimron-Meron (id: 8418)

SHIMRON\-MERON
==============

Canaanite city destroyed by Joshua on his northern military campaign in Palestine. The king of Shimron\-meron was one of 31 kings defeated by Joshua ([Jos 12:20](https://ref.ly/Josh12:20)). This king was perhaps one of the northern kings summoned by Jabin, king of Hazor, to combine forces in an attempt to defeat Joshua ([11:1](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1)). In all probability, Shimron\-meron was one of the 12 cities included in the territory allotted to Zebulun for an inheritance ([19:15](https://ref.ly/Josh19:15)).
