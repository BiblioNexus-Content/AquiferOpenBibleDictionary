## Lentil (id: 6719)

LENTIL
======

The lentil plant mentioned in [Genesis 25:29–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34), [2 Samuel 17:27–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27-2Sam17:29), [23:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11), and [Ezekiel 4:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:9) is a small, upright annual plant that looks similar to vetch (a climbing plant with purple, pink, or white flowers that belongs to the pea family). It has thin stems and leaves with tendrils (small, curling parts that help the plant climb or hold onto things).

The plant produces small white flowers with violet stripes. Its seeds grow in flat pods that look similar to pea pods. These seeds are the lentils that people eat.
