## Attalus (id: 3872)

ATTALUS
=======

The name or title of several kings of Pergamum. Attalus II Philadelphus, the king from 159 to 138 BC, probably received a “letter of recommendation” for the Jews from the Roman consul Lucius ([1 Maccabees 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Macc15:22)). This Attalus was succeeded by his nephew Philometor Evergetes, who reigned from 138 to 133 BC. Philometor gave his kingdom to Rome, ending the history of Pergamum as a political entity. Rome organized the kingdom into the province of Asia.
