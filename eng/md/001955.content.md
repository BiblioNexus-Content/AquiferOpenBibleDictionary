## Ezbon (id: 5213)

EZBON
=====

1\. Gad’s son ([Gn 46:16](https://ref.ly/Gen46:16)), called Ozni in [Numbers 26:16](https://ref.ly/Num26:16); perhaps an eponym of a Gadite family.

2\. Benjamin’s grandson ([1 Chr 7:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:7)). It has been proposed that [1 Chronicles 7:6–11](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:6-1Chr7:11) is a genealogy of Zebulun assigned to Benjamin by error, and that Ezbon suggests Ibzan ([Jgs 12:8–10](https://ref.ly/Judg12:8-Judg12:10)), a minor judge of Bethlehem.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 46:16; NUM 26:16; 1CH 7:7; JDG 12:8–JDG 12:10; 1CH 7:6–1CH 7:11
