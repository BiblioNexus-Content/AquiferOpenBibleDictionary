## Lysias (id: 6805)

LYSIAS
======

1. A Roman commander who wrote a letter to Felix about the apostle Paul ([Acts 23:26](https://ref.ly/Acts23:26)).

    *See* Claudius Lysias.

2. A high official during the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Around 166–165 BC, Antiochus went to fight the Parthians and left Lysias in charge of Syria ([1 Maccabees 3:31–37](https://ref.ly/1Macc3:31-1Macc3:37)). Lysias sent generals Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias to bring Judas Maccabeus under control in Judea. Then he himself led an attack on Judas. 
  
At last, Antiochus Epiphanes signed and approved a peace treaty (2 Maccabees 11\). The agreement ended the harsh laws against the Jews. After that, Judas cleaned the temple and started the daily sacrifices again.

    In 164 BC, Antiochus Epiphanes died. Lysias returned to Judea with the young king Antiochus V Eupator. They defeated Judas Maccabeus at Bethzacharia and began to attack Jerusalem. However, trouble in Antioch forced them to go back to Syria. There, in 162 BC, Demetrius I took power. He had both Lysias and Antiochus V put to death.
