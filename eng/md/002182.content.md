## Gethsemane (id: 5437)

GETHSEMANE
==========

The place where Jesus and his disciples went after their Last Supper together in the upper room. Jesus experienced deep emotional distress because he knew he would soon be betrayed ([Matthew 26:36–56](https://ref.ly/Matt26:36-Matt26:56); [Mark 14:32–50](https://ref.ly/Mark14:32-Mark14:50); [Luke 22:39–53](https://ref.ly/Luke22:39-Luke22:53)).

The name "Gethsemane" appears only in the Gospel of Matthew ([26:36](https://ref.ly/Matt26:36)) and the Gospel of Mark ([14:32](https://ref.ly/Mark14:32)). The name means “oil press.” This tells us there were likely olive trees growing there. The Gospels describe Gethsemane as a “place,” suggesting it had a fence or wall around it. It may be that this place was owned by someone. If so, Jesus and his disciples may have had special permission to enter.

Luke and John do not use the word "Gethsemane" in their Gospels, but they both describe Jesus's suffering before he was betrayed. Luke says this happened on the "Mount of Olives" ([Luke 22:39](https://ref.ly/Luke22:39)). John says it was “across the Kidron Valley” ([John 18:1](https://ref.ly/John18:1)). John is the only one who calls it a garden. These Gospels also tell us that Jesus and his disciples often met there to pray together ([Luke 22:39](https://ref.ly/Luke22:39); [John 18:2](https://ref.ly/John18:2)). The Gospel stories suggest the garden was large enough for the group to separate into smaller groups.
