## Prostitute, Prostitution (id: 7836)

PROSTITUTE, PROSTITUTION
========================

A person guilty of unlawful or forbidden sexual relationships. A prostitute is sometimes used to represent someone who worships an idol. 

It translates four distinct words with different meanings:

1. The man or woman, married or unmarried, who engaged in unlawful sexual behavior ([Genesis 34:31](https://ref.ly/Gen34:31); [Judges 19:2](https://ref.ly/Judg19:2); [Proverbs 23:27](https://ref.ly/Prov23:27)).
2. The temple prostitute of a pagan religion which used sexual practice as part of worship ([Genesis 38:21](https://ref.ly/Gen38:21-Gen38:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen38:21-Gen38:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Gen38:21-Gen38:22); [Deuteronomy 23:17](https://ref.ly/Deut23:17); [Hosea 4:14](https://ref.ly/Hos4:14)). The law of Moses forbade this practice ([Leviticus 19:29](https://ref.ly/Lev19:29); [21:9](https://ref.ly/Lev21:9)).
3. The “strange woman” was another kind of prostitute ([1 Kings 11:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:1); [Proverbs 5:20](https://ref.ly/Prov5:20); [6:24](https://ref.ly/Prov6:24); [7:5](https://ref.ly/Prov7:5); [23:27](https://ref.ly/Prov23:27)). There are different opinions for why that name was given to prostitutes. It may have referred to a woman who was not one's own wife ([Proverbs 5:17–20](https://ref.ly/Prov5:17-Prov5:20)) or a foreign woman ([Numbers 25:1](https://ref.ly/Num25:1); [Joshua 23:13](https://ref.ly/Josh23:13)).
4. Any woman, married or single, who engages in unlawful sexual activity for lust or money ([Matthew 21:31](https://ref.ly/Matt21:31-Matt21:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt21:31-Matt21:32)[32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:31-Matt21:32); [Luke 15:30](https://ref.ly/Luke15:30); [1 Corinthians 6:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16)[16](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16); [Hebrews 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31); [James 2:25](https://ref.ly/Jas2:25)).

Prostitution appeared early in Israel’s history and continued throughout the biblical period. The Bible generally condemns prostitution. For instance, a priest’s daughter who practiced prostitution was to be burned to death ([Leviticus 21:9](https://ref.ly/Lev21:9)). Priests could not marry prostitutes ([Leviticus 19:29](https://ref.ly/Lev19:29)), and the earnings from prostitution could not be used in the temple ([Deuteronomy 23:18](https://ref.ly/Deut23:18)). These rules kept the worship of the Lord free from cult prostitution.

Jacob’s sons killed Hamor and Shechem, saying: “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?” ([Genesis 34:31](https://ref.ly/Gen34:31)). Amaziah’s wife was punished by becoming a prostitute for his mistreatment of the prophet Amos ([Amos 7:17](https://ref.ly/Amos7:17)).

In the first century, prostitutes and tax collectors were both despised by the Jews ([Matthew 21:32](https://ref.ly/Matt21:32)). Paul taught that a Christian’s body belongs to Christ and should not be joined with a prostitute ([1 Corinthians 6:15](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16)[16](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:16)). Proverbs also warns against engaging with prostitutes.

However, some biblical stories show prostitutes in a more positive light. Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute to remind her father\-in\-law of his promise ([Genesis 38:14](https://ref.ly/Gen38:14-Gen38:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen38:14-Gen38:15)[15](https://ref.ly/Gen38:14-Gen38:15)). Rahab, a prostitute, played a significant role in Hebrew history by helping the spies ([Joshua 2:4](https://ref.ly/Josh2:4-Josh2:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh2:4-Josh2:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Josh2:4-Josh2:16); [Hebrews 11:31](https://ref.ly/Heb11:31)).

Figuratively, “prostitute” and “prostitution” are used to describe idolatry, especially in the prophetic books ([Jeremiah 2:20](https://ref.ly/Jer2:20); [Revelation 17:1, 5, 15](https://ref.ly/Rev17:1,Rev17:5,Rev17:15-Rev17:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Rev17:1)[16](https://ref.ly/Rev17:1,Rev17:5,Rev17:15-Rev17:16); [19:2](https://ref.ly/Rev19:2)). This metaphor is based on the relationship between the Lord and His people ([Jeremiah 3:20](https://ref.ly/Jer3:20)). When people worshipped other gods, they were seen as being unfaithful or "prostitutes" ([Judges 8:33](https://ref.ly/Judg8:33)). The same idea is found in the New Testament ([Revelation 17](https://ref.ly/Rev17:1-Rev17:18)).
