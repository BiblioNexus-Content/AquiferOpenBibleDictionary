## Ben-Geber (id: 4104)

BEN\-GEBER
==========

Literally, “Geber’s son.” An official in King Solomon’s court who managed the sixth of 12 districts. The area Ben\-geber managed began at Ramoth\-gilead in northern Transjordan and ended as far north as Argob in Bashan ([1 Kings 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:13)). His association with Geber, son of Uri ([1 Kings 4:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:19)), is not certain.
