RUTH (Person)
=============

A Moabitess and the widow of Mahlon, the son of Naomi and Elimelech, who were Ephrathites from Bethlehem. Naomi and Elimelech moved to Moab due to a famine in Judah. After Elimelech and Naomi's two sons died, Naomi returned to Bethlehem with her daughter\-in\-law Ruth during the barley harvest ([Ruth 1:4](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:4-Ruth1:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:4-Ruth1:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:4-Ruth1:22)). While gleaning in the barley fields of Boaz, Ruth found favor in his eyes ([Ruth 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:2-Ruth2:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:2-Ruth2:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:2-Ruth2:22)). She later married Boaz. He, as the nearest family member, purchased Naomi's estate to keep it in the family. ([Ruth 4:5](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5-Ruth4:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5-Ruth4:13)[13](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:5-Ruth4:13)). Ruth is mentioned in Matthew’s family list of Christ as the mother of Obed and the great\-grandmother of David ([Matthew 1:5](https://ref.ly/Matt1:5)).
