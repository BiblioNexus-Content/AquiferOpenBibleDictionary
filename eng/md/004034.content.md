## Nahor (Person) (id: 7290)

NAHOR (Person)
==============

1. Abraham’s grandfather ([Genesis 11:22](https://ref.ly/Gen11:22-Gen11:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:22-Gen11:25)[25](https://ref.ly/Gen11:22-Gen11:25); [1 Chronicles 1:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:26)), also an ancestor of Jesus according to [Luke 3:34\.](https://ref.ly/Luke3:34) Some English translations use the Greek spelling "Nachor." The Genesis and 1 Chronicles passages show that Nahor is from Shem’s line. Therefore, Abraham and his descendants are part of the Semitic family of nations.
2. Son of Terah and Abraham’s brother ([Genesis 11:26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29)[29](https://ref.ly/Gen11:26-Gen11:29); [Joshua 24:2](https://ref.ly/Josh24:2)). He married Milcah, Haran’s daughter, and his family is named in [Genesis 22:20](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23). Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac at Nahor’s residence in Mesopotamia (see [Genesis 24:10](https://ref.ly/Gen24:10), which possibly suggests that the city itself was called Nahor). There he found Rebekah, Nahor’s granddaughter ([Genesis 24:1](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51)[51](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:51)).

    Nahor is also named as the father (perhaps grandfather) of Laban, to whom Jacob went when he fled from his brother Esau ([Genesis 29:5](https://ref.ly/Gen29:5)). Both of these texts link Abraham’s family with related Semitic people. In [Genesis 31:53](https://ref.ly/Gen31:53) God is spoken of as “the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor.”
