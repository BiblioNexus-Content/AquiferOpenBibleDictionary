## Erastus (id: 5133)

ERASTUS
=======

A name mentioned three times in the New Testament. It is uncertain if it refers to only one individual. Although, in each case, Erastus is a helper of the apostle Paul. The three mentions of Erastus in the New Testament are: 

1. A helper of Paul sent with the apostle Timothy into Macedonia ([Acts 19:22](https://ref.ly/Acts19:22)).
2. The city treasurer of Corinth, an official who managed finances. He might have been a slave or a wealthy freed slave and an important man in the Corinthian community. He sends greetings with Paul to the church in Rome ([Romans 16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23)).
3. A friend of Paul who stayed at Corinth ([2 Timothy 4:20](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:20)).
