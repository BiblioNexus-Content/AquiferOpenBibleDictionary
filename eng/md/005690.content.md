## Tulip (id: 8940)

TULIP
=====

A tulip is a flowering plant that grows from a bulb. Several types of tulips are native to Asia. The rose of Sharon mentioned in [Song of Solomon 2:1](https://ref.ly/Song2:1) may be the mountain tulip (*Tulipa montana*) or the closely related Sharon tulip (*Tulipa* *sharonensis*).

The mountain tulip is an attractive plant with leaves that often have wavy edges. This species commonly grows in the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and the Anti\-Lebanon. As its name suggests, it primarily grows in mountain areas.

The Sharon tulip grows in sandy places on the Sharon coastal plains.
