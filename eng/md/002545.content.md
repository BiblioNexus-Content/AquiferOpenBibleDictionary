## Hemorrhage (id: 5798)

HEMORRHAGE
==========

A flow of blood coming from a cut or nosebleed ([Proverbs 30:33](https://ref.ly/Prov30:33)). 

In Scripture, it mostly refers to menstruation. Laws about normal and abnormal menstruation are given in [Leviticus 15:19](https://ref.ly/Lev15:19-Lev15:30)–[30](https://ref.ly/Lev15:19-Lev15:30). A woman with normal menstruation was unclean for seven days, as well as anything she touched. Any woman who bled longer than seven days was unclean as long as she was bleeding, plus seven additional days.

All the Gospels except John tell the story of Jesus miraculously healing the woman who had bled for 12 years ([Matthew 9:20](https://ref.ly/Matt9:20-Matt9:22)–[22](https://ref.ly/Matt9:20-Matt9:22); [Mark 5:25](https://ref.ly/Mark5:25-Mark5:34)–[34](https://ref.ly/Mark5:25-Mark5:34); [Luke 8:43](https://ref.ly/Luke8:43-Luke8:48)–[48](https://ref.ly/Luke8:43-Luke8:48)). By touching Jesus’s clothing, the woman violated the Old Testament laws about menstruation, as she was making Jesus’s garment unclean ([Leviticus 15](https://ref.ly/Lev15:1-Lev15:33)). Her act of faith in Jesus healed her.
