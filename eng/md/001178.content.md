## Carnaim (id: 4433)

CARNAIM
=======

Carnaim was a strong city in the region of Gilead. It became important after the Babylonian exile. Judas Maccabeus attacked and destroyed Carnaim ([1 Maccabees 5:26, 43–44](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:26,1Macc5:43-1Macc5:44); [2 Maccabees 12:21–23, 26](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:21-2Macc12:23,2Macc12:26)). He also destroyed the temple in the city. This temple was for Atargatis, a Syrian goddess linked to fish.
