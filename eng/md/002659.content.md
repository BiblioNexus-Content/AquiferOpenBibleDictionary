HORNET, WASP
============

Hornets and wasps are stinging insects in the same family (Vespidae). Hornets are a kind of wasp that live together in large groups. They make big nests above the ground. A nest can hold more than 1,000 hornets. 

In the Bible, the hornet is often a symbol of God using armies to drive out Israel’s enemies ([Exodus 23:28](https://ref.ly/Exod23:28); [Deuteronomy 7:20](https://ref.ly/Deut7:20); [Joshua 24:12](https://ref.ly/Josh24:12)).
