## Akrabbim (id: 3490)

AKRABBIM
========

A mountain pass or slope in southern Palestine between the southwestern end of the Dead Sea and the Wilderness of Zin. The pass of Mount Akrabbim was part of the southern border of the land given to Judah's tribe after they conquered Canaan ([Numbers 34:4](https://ref.ly/Num34:4); [Joshua 15:3](https://ref.ly/Josh15:3); [Judges 1:36](https://ref.ly/Judg1:36)). During the time between the Old and New Testaments, Judas Maccabeus won an important battle against the Idumeans at this pass ([1 Maccabees 5:3](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:3)). 

It is also called Scorpion Pass.
