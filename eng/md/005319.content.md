## Sopater (id: 8578)

SOPATER
=======

A man from the church at Berea. Sopater accompanied the apostle Paul to Jerusalem to deliver the offering collected by the gentile churches. This offering was for the Jewish Christians who were suffering from the effects of a famine ([Acts 20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). Sopater may be the same person as Sosipater, the relative of Paul who sent greetings to the church at Rome ([Romans 16:21](https://ref.ly/Rom16:21)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 20:4; ROM 16:21
