2. A fortress or defensive wall that was part of the city of David in Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 5:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:9); [1 Chronicles 11:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:8)). King Solomon later rebuilt or made this fortification bigger ([1 Kings 9:15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15); [11:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:27)).

    Two kings of Judah had important connections to the Millo:

    * Some of Joash's servants killed him in “the house of Millo” ([2 Kings 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:20)).
        * King Hezekiah made the Millo stronger when King Sennacherib of Assyria threatened to invade Jerusalem ([2 Chronicles 32:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:5)).
