## Mitylene (id: 7174)

MITYLENE
========

A main city on the island of Lesbos in the Aegean Sea near the northwestern coast of Asia Minor. Mitylene was a seaport with two harbors. They first built it on a small island separate from Lesbos. 

In New Testament times, a raised roadway across a narrow stretch of water connected it with the main island. [Acts 20:14](https://ref.ly/Acts20:14) identifies Mitylene as one of the overnight stopping places where Paul and his traveling companions lodged. This was as they journeyed by ship toward Jerusalem.
