## Quince (id: 718704)

Quince
======

The quince is a tree native to western Asia. It has white flowers and fruit that looks like apples. The fruit can only be eaten when cooked. Some scholars believe that the "apples" mentioned in the Old Testament were actually quinces, *Cydonia oblonga*.

The quince tree is quite common in the region of Palestine, though mainly as a cultivated tree rather than growing wild. It may be found growing naturally in the northern parts of Syria. The quince is native to northern Persia and Asia Minor (modern\-day Turkey).

The fruit is yellowish in color and has a strong, pleasant smell. It was this fragrance that made the quince highly valued by people in ancient times.
