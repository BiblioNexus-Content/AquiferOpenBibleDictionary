## Hazar-Susah, Hazar-Susim (id: 5732)

HAZAR\-SUSAH, HAZAR\-SUSIM
==========================

City assigned to Simeon within the territory allotted to Judah for an inheritance ([Jos 19:5](https://ref.ly/Josh19:5)); alternately called Hazar\-susim ([1 Chr 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:31)). Solomon probably used it as a transfer point for horses brought from Egypt for sale to the Hittites and Syrians, as suggested by its name, meaning “horse station.” Hazar\-susah has been identified with Sbalat Abu Susein, east of the Wadi Far’ah.
