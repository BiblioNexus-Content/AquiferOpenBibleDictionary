## Sur Gate (id: 8659)

SUR GATE
========

Gate in Jerusalem linking the king’s palace to the temple. It is mentioned in [2 Kings 11:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:6) in connection with the enthronement of Jehoash over Judah and the murder of Athaliah. Its parallel passage in [2 Chronicles 23:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:5) reads the “Gate of the Foundation,” revealing perhaps a corruption within the Hebrew text.

* **Associated Passages:** 2KI 11:6; 2CH 23:5
