## Abiah (id: 3285)

ABIAH
=====

1. The King James Version's translation for Abijah, Samuel’s son, in [1 Samuel 8:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:2) and [1 Chronicles 6:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:28).

    *See* Abijah \#1.

2. The King James Version's translation of a Hebrew word in [1 Chronicles 2:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:24). The translation makes the word a name, Abiah, the wife of Hezron. Most modern translations, use "his father:" "Caleb went in to Ephrathah, the wife of Hezron his father." The Berean Standard Bible translates it like the King James Version (as a proper name). 
  
The Hebrew text is difficult, with different manuscript traditions preserving variations, which explains the differences between the versions.
3. The King James Version's translation for Abijah, Becher’s son, in [1 Chronicles 7:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:8).

    *See* Abijah \#5.
