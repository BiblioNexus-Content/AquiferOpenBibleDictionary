## Evi (id: 5199)

EVI
===

Evi was one of five kings of Midian who were killed in a battle against Israel under the leadership of Moses ([Numbers 31:8](https://ref.ly/Num31:8)). God apparently told Moses to fight against Midian because the Midianites had led the Israelites to practice pagan religions. [Joshua 13:21](https://ref.ly/Josh13:21) calls Evi a prince of Sihon, the Midianite king.
