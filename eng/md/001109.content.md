## Burning Bush (id: 4364)

BURNING BUSH
============

The flaming bush on Mount Horeb, where Moses encountered God and was sent to lead Israel out of Egypt ([Exodus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod3:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod3:15); [Mark 12:26](https://ref.ly/Mark12:26); [Luke 20:37](https://ref.ly/Luke20:37); [Acts 7:30](https://ref.ly/Acts7:30-Acts7:34)–[34](https://ref.ly/Acts7:30-Acts7:34)). The mystery of a plant burning without being destroyed allowed God to reveal his name, “I Am Who I Am.” The burning bush was a theophany, a visible sign of God’s presence. In the Bible, God's glory is associated with clouds, fire, and smoke (see [Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21); [19:18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:18); [1 Kings 8:10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)–[11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11); [2 Kings 1:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:12); [2:11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:11); [Isaiah 6:1](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:6)–[6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:6); [2 Thessalonians 1:7](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:7); [Revelation 1:14](https://ref.ly/Rev1:14); [19:12](https://ref.ly/Rev19:12)).

The burning bush symbolizes God’s holiness. Moses was told to remove his shoes because he was standing on holy ground ([Exodus 3:5](https://ref.ly/Exod3:5)). The gods of Egypt were often thought to live in gloomy darkness, But, Israel’s God lives in unapproachable light ([1 Timothy 6:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:16)). The burning bush symbolized his intention not to destroy his people, but to save them, and lead them out of slavery in Egypt and into the Promised Land.
