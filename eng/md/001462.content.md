## Cup-Bearer (id: 4710)

CUP\-BEARER
===========

Official whose primary duty was to taste the wine served to the king as a precaution against poisoning. Cup\-bearers frequented the courts of kings and high officials in antiquity ([1 Kgs 10:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:5)). These men were close to those in authority and sometimes exercised considerable influence. Generally several of them served the king with the “chief cup\-bearer” (butler) at their head ([Gn 40:1–23](https://ref.ly/Gen40:1-Gen40:23)). Solomon’s court included cup\-bearers ([2 Chr 9:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:4)), and Nehemiah was the king’s cup\-bearer ([Neh 1:11–2:1](https://ref.ly/Neh1:11-Neh2:1)); Rabshakeh may have been a cup\-bearer ([2 Kgs 18:13–19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:13-2Kgs18:19); [Is 36:2](https://ref.ly/Isa36:2)).
