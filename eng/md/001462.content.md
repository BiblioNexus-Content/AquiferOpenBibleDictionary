## Cup of Blessing (id: 4711)

CUP OF BLESSING\*
=================

Theological phrase used in two contexts: (1\) in Jewish usage, a cup of wine drunk at the end of a meal and having special Passover significance; (2\) in Christian usage, the Communion goblet.

In the Passover feast the cup of blessing is the third of four cups required in the ceremony of the Paschal meal. It derives its name from the prayer offered over the cup: “Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, who givest us the fruit of the vine.”

The apostle Paul used the term in reference to the wine of the Lord’s Supper ([1 Cor 10:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:16)). His words are taken by many interpreters as evidence that the early church saw the Lord’s Supper as a transformation and fulfillment of the Passover celebration. To participate in drinking the cup of blessing is to commit oneself to Christ, “our paschal lamb” ([5:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:7)), whose death it commemorates, and to enter into “communion” or fellowship with him. The phrase “cup of the Lord” ([10:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:21); [11:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:27)) or simply “the cup” ([11:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25)) is also used. Paul added that true communion with Christ, signified by the cup of blessing, should exclude communion with spiritual forces opposed to Christ, signified by the “cup of demons” ([10:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:21)).
