## Meribah (id: 7069)

MERIBAH
=======

1. A place name meaning "strife" or "conflict." It is named for a place at Horeb, near Rephidim (Wadi Feiran). There, Israel contended with Moses for water at the start of the wilderness wanderings ([Exodus 17:7](https://ref.ly/Exod17:7)). This is the place probably referred to in [Deuteronomy 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8) and [Psalm 95:8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8) and is also called Massah.
2. Another place where Israel fought with Moses for water. It is near Kadesh\-barnea in the wilderness of Zin. God again provided water from a rock ([Numbers 20:13, 24](https://ref.ly/Num20:13,Num20:24); [27:14](https://ref.ly/Num27:14)); also called Meribath\-kadesh in [Deuteronomy 32:51](https://ref.ly/Deut32:51). This event happened toward the end of the Israelites' time in the desert. The waters of Meribah were called "waters of conflict" because God became angry with Moses and Aaron there. They did not follow God's exact instructions to speak to the rock. Instead, Moses—who was frustrated by the people's stubbornness—struck the rock twice with his staff. The psalm writer tells us that God tested Israel at this place ([Psalm 81:7](https://ref.ly/Ps81:7)), and Israel’s rebellion led Moses to sin ([Psalm 106:32](https://ref.ly/Ps106:32)). Meribah\-kadesh is mentioned as being on Israel’s southern border ([Ezekiel 47:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:19); [48:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:28)).
