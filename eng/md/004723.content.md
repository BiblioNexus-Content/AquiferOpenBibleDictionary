## Rehoboth-Ir (id: 7982)

REHOBOTH\-IR
============

Name meaning “broad places of the city.” It was the second city built by Nimrod the hunter (kjv “Asshur”) in Assyria ([Gn 10:11](https://ref.ly/Gen10:11); kjv “Rehoboth”). Opinion differs as to whether it was a distinct municipality (a suburb of Nineveh) or, since the name of the town is not mentioned in Assyrian literature, open squares or broad streets within Nineveh itself.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 10:11
