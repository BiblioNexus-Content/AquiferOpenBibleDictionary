## Most Holy Place (id: 7217)

MOST HOLY PLACE
===============

The inner room of the tabernacle and temple where they kept the ark of the covenant. The ark was a gold\-covered wooden box that held important holy items, including the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments ([Exodus 25:10–22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22)). 

This room was the most holy space in Israelite worship. Only the high priest could enter it, and only once each year on the Day of Atonement ([Leviticus 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34)). Before entering, the high priest had to perform special cleansing rituals.

In the temple, the most holy place was separated from the rest of the building by a thick curtain. This curtain tore from top to bottom when Jesus died ([Matthew 27:51](https://ref.ly/Matt27:51)).

The room was also called the "holy of holies," which means "the holiest place."
