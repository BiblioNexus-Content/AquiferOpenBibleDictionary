## Apple, Apple Tree (id: 3680)

APPLE, APPLE TREE
=================

A tree that grows to a height of about 4\.5–7\.6 meters (15–25 feet) and produces round, firm, sweet fruits. The tree has oval leaves with slightly toothed edges and produces white or pink blossoms in spring before bearing fruit.

The apple tree was not native to the Near East. Some Bible versions translate certain fruit references in the Old Testament as "apple." The Hebrew word *tappuach* is often translated as "apple" ([Proverbs 25:11](https://ref.ly/Prov25:11); [Song of Solomon 2:3, 5](https://ref.ly/Song2:3,Song2:5); [7:8](https://ref.ly/Song7:8); [8:5](https://ref.ly/Song8:5)). This translation comes from its similarity to the Arabic word for apple, *tuffah*.

Some scholars think the fruit referred to in these passages might actually be an apricot, because apples may not have been common in ancient Palestine. However, researchers found carbonized apples (probably crab apples, *Malus sylvestris*) during excavations at Kadesh\-barnea from the 9th century BC. This discovery suggests that apples could have been grown in King Solomon's gardens.
