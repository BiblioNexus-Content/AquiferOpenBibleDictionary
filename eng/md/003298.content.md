## Kerethites (id: 6556)

KERETHITES
==========

The Kerethites were a group of people who lived in southern Judah, near Hebron ([1 Samuel 30:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:14)). [2 Samuel 8:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:18) mentions them along with the Pelethites. [Ezekiel 25:15–17](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:15-Ezek25:17) associates the Kerethites with the Philistines (compare [Zephaniah 2:5](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:5)). God judged them along with other people who lived along the seacoast because of the wrong things the Philistines did to Israel.

Many scholars believe that the name Kerethite means "Cretan" (someone from the island of Crete). This makes sense because the Philistines may have come from Crete and other islands in the Mediterranean Sea. The word Pelethite is probably another way of saying "Philistine."

Because the Kerethites were likely related to the Philistines, we can learn about them by studying the Philistines. Art from Crete and Egypt shows Philistines wearing feathered or plumed head coverings. Pottery from Philistine, Cretan, and Greek places also looks very similar. This suggests these groups were closely connected.

The Kerethites and Pelethites became soldiers for King David. They were foreign fighters who worked for pay (called mercenaries). These soldiers were very loyal to David, even during difficult times ([2 Samuel 15:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:18); [20:7, 23](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:7,2Sam20:23); [1 Kings 1:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:38)). Later kings of Judah may have also used them as soldiers. Some people think the “Carites” in [2 Kings 11:4, 19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:4,2Kgs11:19) were Kerethites.
