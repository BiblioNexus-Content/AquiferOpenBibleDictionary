## Spider (id: 8598)

SPIDER
======

An animal that is part of the Araneida family. There are between 600 and 700 species in the Holy Land. Unlike insects, spiders (and scorpions) each have eight legs. They also have poison glands. The strength of the poison depends on the kind of spider. Some can kill only insects. Others can also kill birds and mice.

Most spiders have a pair of spinnerets. These are connected to silk glands under the abdomen. The spider uses them to make a web. In the Bible, a spider’s web is a picture of weakness and insecurity ([Job 8:14](https://ref.ly/Job8:14); [Isaiah 59:5–6](https://ref.ly/Isa59:5-Isa59:6)).
