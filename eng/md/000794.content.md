## Beer (id: 4073)

BEER
====

1. A place where Israel camped while in the wilderness. It was probably just north of the Arnon River on the border of Moab and Amurru ([Numbers 21:16](https://ref.ly/Num21:16)). The name means “a well.” Water from the well they dug there was sung about ([Numbers 21:17–18](https://ref.ly/Num21:17-Num21:18)). It may have been in the same place as the Moabite well called *Beer\-elim* ([Isaiah 15:8](https://ref.ly/Isa15:8)).

    *See* Wilderness Wanderings.

2. The place that Gideon’s son Jotham escaped to after criticizing his half brother Abimelech, who had killed all his half\-brothers while trying to become king of Israel ([Judges 9:21](https://ref.ly/Judg9:21)).
