## Neapolis (id: 7322)

NEAPOLIS
========

Neapolis was a port city that served the larger city of Philippi. Today, this ancient city is known as Kavalla. The name Neapolis comes from a Greek word meaning "new city." Neapolis existed as early as the fifth century BC. During the time of the Roman Empire, Neapolis clearly depended on the nearby city of Philippi.

The apostle Paul dreamed about a man from Macedonia asking for help. After that, Paul left Troas and the continent of Asia to travel to the continent of Europe. Paul and his companions sailed past the island of Samothrace and then arrived at Neapolis. This made Neapolis the first European city that Paul visited during his missionary journeys ([Acts 16:11](https://ref.ly/Acts16:11)).
