## Keturah (id: 6568)

KETURAH
=======

Keturah was the second wife of Abraham. The Bible does not clearly state if Abraham married her before or after Sarah died ([Genesis 25:1](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1)). Abraham and Keturah had six sons together:

1. Zimran
2. Jokshan
3. Medan
4. Midian
5. Ishbak
6. Shuah (see [Genesis 25:2](https://ref.ly/Gen25:2))

Keturah did not have the same status as Sarah. The Bible calls her a concubine ([Genesis 25:6](https://ref.ly/Gen25:6), compare [1 Chronicles 1:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:32)). Her sons received gifts from Abraham instead of sharing in his inheritance. 

The sons of Keturah became ancestors of tribes that Israel later had contact with after they entered the promised land. The most important of these tribes were Midian and Jokshan's sons Sheba and Dedan ([Genesis 25:3](https://ref.ly/Gen25:3)). These tribes settled in the northern and central regions near the Euphrates River, extending into the central parts of the Arabian Desert.

The people worked as merchants and shepherds ([Genesis 37](https://ref.ly/Gen37:1-Gen37:36); [Exodus 2:16](https://ref.ly/Exod2:16)). They took part in international trade ([Isaiah 60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6)). For example, the queen of Sheba, who was a descendant of Jokshan ([Genesis 25:3](https://ref.ly/Gen25:3)), visited Solomon to start trading with Israel ([1 Kings 10:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:2)).
