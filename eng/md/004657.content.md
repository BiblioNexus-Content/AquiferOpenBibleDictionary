## Ram (id: 7940)

RAM
===

A ram is an adult male sheep, usually with large curved horns. Rams are stronger and larger than female sheep. In Bible times, people kept rams for breeding, meat, and wool. Rams were also offered as sacrifices to God ([Genesis 22:13](https://ref.ly/Gen22:13); [Exodus 29:15](https://ref.ly/Exod29:15)).

The horn of a ram, called a ram’s horn or shofar, was sometimes used as a trumpet in worship and war ([Joshua 6:4–5](https://ref.ly/Josh6:4-Josh6:5)).
