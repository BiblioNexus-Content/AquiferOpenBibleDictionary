## Baal-Perazim (id: 3942)

BAAL\-PERAZIM
=============

A location near Jerusalem where a battle was fought between Israel’s newly anointed King David and the Philistines ([2 Samuel 5:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:20); [1 Chronicles 14:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:11)). David named the area Baal\-perazim to remember the Lord’s “breaking through” his enemies, since the phrase means the “lord of breaking through.” [Isaiah 28:21](https://ref.ly/Isa28:21) references Mount Perazim, where the Lord came “suddenly and in anger.” This may recall David’s battle with the Philistines.
