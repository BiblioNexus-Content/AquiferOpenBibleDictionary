## Punishment (id: 7857)

PUNISHMENT
==========

Punishment is when someone with authority causes pain or loss to another person who has done something wrong. This could include taking away their freedom or money. For there to be punishment, two things must exist: 

* someone with the authority to give the punishment
* someone who has done wrong

Punishment as Prevention
------------------------

Some people say punishment is right if it stops people from doing wrong things again. They believe punishment should either:

* help the person who did wrong learn to be better (reform)
* stop that person and others from doing wrong things in the future (deter)

These people think that if punishment does not help someone improve or stop bad behavior, then it should not be used.

Punishment as Retribution
-------------------------

Others say that people who do wrong should be punished simply because they did wrong. This view is called "retribution" (giving someone what they deserve). It is based on God's moral law and basic ideas about justice.

This view is different from revenge or wanting to hurt someone out of anger. It is about making sure wrongdoing has fair consequences. In favor of the view that punishment should be retributive, the following arguments have been offered: 

1. The Bible gives clear instructions about punishing someone by killing them ([Genesis 9:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:5-Gen9:6)). These are not among the moral and ceremonial laws that Christians believe were abolished through Jesus. The New Testament also says that governments have the right to punish wrongdoing ("carry the sword," [Romans 13:1](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen9:5-Gen9:6)[5](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:5)).
2. In addition to arguments from the Bible, we can also look at basic principles of fairness and justice. One important principle is that punishment should match the crime. This helps protect people from unfair government power by setting clear limits on how the government can punish someone who breaks the law. 
  
For example, the just and fair government cannot keep someone in prison forever just for "treatment." It also cannot respond to crimes with extreme and unlimited punishment.

This approach to punishment treats each person as responsible for their own actions. It also assumes people are free until they commit a crime. This helps everyone know what to expect from the law. Some people say that executing criminals is wrong because it adds another death to the first one. However, this same argument could be used against all types of punishment.

The Problem of How Much to Punish
---------------------------------

Both views have the same problem of how much punishment is right for each wrong action. Small wrongs could be stopped by very harsh punishments, but that might not be fair. And a punishment rarely matches the wrong that was done exactly.

Punishment Only When It Benefits Society
----------------------------------------

Some people disagree with punishment that aims to balance out wrongdoing. They believe punishment should only be used when it will lead to better results than not punishing someone. This view focuses on what works best for society rather than on responding to the wrong action itself. Another argument against punishment says that all humans are part of one family, so no person or group should have the right to punish others.

However, both of these views have problems. The first view could allow very harsh punishments if someone thought the results would be good for society. The second view would make it impossible to have any kind of government over people who sometimes do wrong things.

Different Views of Jesus's Death
--------------------------------

Jesus's death is understood by many Christians as a sacrificial offering. It is often seen as vicarious and penal, where he took the penalty for sin on behalf of humanity to satisfy divine justice. This view emphasizes that his death removes the guilt of sin and restores the relationship between humanity and God ([Romans 5:8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:8); [Galatians 3:13](https://ref.ly/Gal3:13)). 

However, another view focuses more on Jesus's death and resurrection as a victory over death and sin, emphasizing his role in healing, restoring humanity, and reconciling people to God. This view places less emphasis on suffering punishment in place of sinners.

While some Christian traditions emphasize the retributive aspects of justice, others focus on the restorative aspect of justice shown in Jesus's work of healing, victory, and reconciliation. The debate continues about how retributive justice should be understood or applied in modern contexts.

Modern Ideas About Punishment
-----------------------------

Another important question is what types of punishment should be allowed in a justice system. In earlier centuries, many offenders experienced cruel punishments like being hanged, having body parts cut off, or being killed in painful ways (even for small crimes). Today, most people think these punishments were cruel and took away human dignity.

What people think is right or wrong punishment can change over time. For example, some argue that certain types of physical punishment might be less harmful than putting people in dirty prisons with other criminals.

The Bible teaches that after death, God will judge all people fairly. Because of what the Bible says about God's perfect wisdom, justice, and mercy, we can trust that this judgement will be equitable and just.
