SABACHTHANI
===========

One of the final words Jesus spoke during his crucifixion ([Matthew 27:46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46); [Mark 15:34](https://ref.ly/Mark15:34)). It is an Aramaic word. The entire phrase "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani" is translated "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This expression is also the opening question of Psalm 22\. 

*See* Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani.
