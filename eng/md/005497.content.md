## Tebah (Place) (id: 8758)

TEBAH (Place)
=============

Tebah was a city that belonged to King Hadadezer. King David took a large amount of bronze from this city during battle ([2 Samuel 8:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:8); [1 Chronicles 18:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:8)). Hadadezer was the king of Zobah, an area located in the Hamath region in Syria. Because of this connection, Tebah was probably located somewhere in that same region.
