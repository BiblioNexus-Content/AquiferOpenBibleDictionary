## Shamgar (id: 8275)

SHAMGAR
=======

Son of Anath from Beth\-anath; a judge of Israel. Two brief references in the OT ([Jgs 3:31](https://ref.ly/Judg3:31); [5:6](https://ref.ly/Judg5:6)) tell us little of the man except for his one major exploit: the killing of 600 Philistines with an oxgoad. How such a feat was performed is not recorded. The oxgoad could have had a sharpened metal tip and may have been used as a spear. The timing of the reference indicates that his deeds took place early in the period of Philistine settlement in Canaan. [Judges 5:6](https://ref.ly/Judg5:6) would place him prior to the battle of Kishon (c. 1125 BC).
