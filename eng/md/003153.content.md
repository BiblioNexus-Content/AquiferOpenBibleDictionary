JOHN OF GISCHALA\*
==================

Leader in the first Jewish revolt, from Gischala (Gush\-halab) in Galilee. He was a rival of Josephus Flavius, who had been appointed commander of Galilee by the Jews. When Vespasian sent his son Titus against Gischala in AD 67, John fled to Jerusalem and took part in the defense of the city. Eventually, he surrendered to the Romans and was imprisoned in Italy. *See* First Jewish Revolt.
