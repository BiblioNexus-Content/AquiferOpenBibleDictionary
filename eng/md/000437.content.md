## Aram-Naharaim (id: 3698)

ARAM\-NAHARAIM
==============

A Hebrew word meaning “Aram of the two rivers.” It refers to the area bounded by the upper Euphrates and the Habur Rivers. It is sometimes translated “Mesopotamia” ([Deuteronomy 23:4](https://ref.ly/Deut23:4), Revised Standard Version). 

The major city of that area was Haran, where Terah and Abram stopped. It was also where Terah died ([Genesis 11:31–32](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen11:32)). A servant of Abram (later called Abraham) returned to the same region to seek a wife for Abraham’s son Isaac ([Genesis 24:1–10](https://ref.ly/Gen24:1-Gen24:10)). Isaac’s son Jacob also returned to Haran to seek a wife ([Genesis 28:1–5](https://ref.ly/Gen28:1-Gen28:5)) Paddan\-aram is another name for Aram\-naharaim. Aram\-naharaim was the home of Balaam, who was a pagan prophet ([Deuteronomy 23:4](https://ref.ly/Deut23:4)). 

One oppressor of Israel during the period of the judges was Cushan\-rishathaim, king of Aram\-naharaim ([Judges 3:8–11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:8-Judg3:11)). Later, in King David’s wars with Ammon, he had to confront mercenary charioteers hired from the Aramean centers of Aram\-naharaim, Aram\-maacah, and Zobah ([1 Chronicles 19:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:6); compare [Psalm 60 title](https://ref.ly/Ps60:1)). *See* Syria, Syrians.
