## Truth (id: 8935)

TRUTH
=====

That which is real and verifiable by experience.

In Scripture, truth is a very important concept because God is the God of all truth ([Pss 31:5](https://ref.ly/Ps31:5); [108:4](https://ref.ly/Ps108:4); [146:6](https://ref.ly/Ps146:6)), who speaks and judges truly ([57:3](https://ref.ly/Ps57:3); [96:13](https://ref.ly/Ps96:13)). He is the real source and cause of the whole universe. Scripture also focuses on the revealed truth in the gospel of God’s redeeming grace through Christ. This is the truth Christ and the apostles proclaimed ([Jn 8:44–46](https://ref.ly/John8:44-John8:46); [18:37](https://ref.ly/John18:37); [Rom 9:1](https://ref.ly/Rom9:1); [2 Cor 4:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:2)), which was foreshadowed in the OT ([1 Pt 1:10–12](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:10-1Pet1:12)), and witnessed to by the Holy Spirit ([Jn 16:13](https://ref.ly/John16:13)). The OT teaching was never false, but it was shadowy and incomplete in comparison with the revealed truth of the NT. So Christ brought spiritual reality ([Jn 1:17](https://ref.ly/John1:17)), and the Holy Spirit leads believers into the experience of all that is real in Christ ([16:13](https://ref.ly/John16:13)).

Christ is the truth because, being God, his words carry divine authority. They are truth and life ([Jn 6:63](https://ref.ly/John6:63)). In addition, the life of Christ epitomized truthfulness and utter reliability. When people live in obedience to the truth, they themselves are true and reliable. Scripture calls upon people to “do the truth” ([Jn 3:21](https://ref.ly/John3:21), kjv). Those who have experienced God’s reality in Christ know, by experience, that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life ([Jn 14:6](https://ref.ly/John14:6)).
