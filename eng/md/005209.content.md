## Sibbecai, Sibbechai (id: 8473)

SIBBECAI, SIBBECHAI
===================

A Zerahite from the town of Hushah. He was one of the mighty men of King David ([1 Chronicles 11:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:29); [20:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:4); [27:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:11)). [2 Samuel 21:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:18) credits him with killing the giant Saph when Israel fought Philistia at Gob. In [2 Samuel 23:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:27) he is called Mebunnai, probably a later incorrect reading of the original.
