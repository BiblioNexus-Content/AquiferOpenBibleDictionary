## People of the East (id: 7652)

PEOPLE OF THE EAST\*
====================

Tribes located east and northeast of Canaan, many of them overtly hostile to the Jews. [Genesis 29:1](https://ref.ly/Gen29:1) provides the first reference to these peoples. Jacob, en route to Haran, crossed through territory designated as “the land of the people of the east.”

The comprehensiveness of the term is evident in the way it is used to refer to nomads ([Ez 25:10](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:10)) or Mesopotamians ([1 Kgs 4:30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:30)). The term also occurs in association with specific tribes, such as the Amalekites ([Jgs 6:3](https://ref.ly/Judg6:3)), Ammonites ([Ez 25:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:4)), Edomites ([Is 11:14](https://ref.ly/Isa11:14)), Kedarites ([Jer 49:28](https://ref.ly/Jer49:28)), Midianites ([Jgs 6:33](https://ref.ly/Judg6:33)), and Moabites ([Ez 25:10](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:10)).

The most distinguished OT personality linked to the term is the patriarch Job, who is called the greatest man among all the people of the east ([Jb 1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3)). Job’s homeland, the land of Uz, was probably in the vicinity of Edom to the southeast of the Dead Sea.
