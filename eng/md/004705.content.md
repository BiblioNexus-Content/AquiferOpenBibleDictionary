## Recorder (id: 7968)

RECORDER
========

The title of a high government official who served in the royal courts from King David's time until the end of the kingdom of Israel. The Old Testament does not clearly state what this person did, but the recorder probably kept the official records and gave advice to the king based on this information. 

[2 Samuel 8:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:16), [20:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:24), and [1 Kings 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:3) mention a recorder with other leading officers. The recorder spoke for King Hezekiah in his dealings with Rabshekah ([2 Kings 18:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18)). During the rule of King Josiah, a recorder supervised temple repairs ([2 Chronicles 34:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:8)).
