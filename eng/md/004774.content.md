## Righteousness (id: 8037)

RIGHTEOUSNESS
=============

Having a right relationship, mainly with God and also with others. 

Meeting just expectations in any relationship, such as between spouses, parents and children, citizens, workers and employers, merchants and customers, rulers and citizens, and God and people. This is called righteousness. When someone fulfills these expectations, their actions and words are considered righteous. The opposite of righteous is "evil," "wicked," or "wrong" (compare [Psalm 1:6](https://ref.ly/Ps1:6); [Zephaniah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:5)).

Righteousness in the Old Testament
----------------------------------

In Israel, righteousness influenced all aspects of life, both religious and secular (non\-religious). Israel was called to be a special nation to show God's rule, nature, and expectations to the world. They needed God's revelation to understand his will and maintain a relationship with him. A person's relationship with God was directly connected to their relationship with others.

### God's Righteousness and Human Righteousness

God is righteous ([2 Chronicles 12:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:6); [Psalms 7:9](https://ref.ly/Ps7:9); [103:17](https://ref.ly/Ps103:17); [Zephaniah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:5); [Zechariah 8:8](https://ref.ly/Zech8:8)). His righteousness shows in his actions for his people and his relationship with them. All of God's acts are righteous (compare [Deuteronomy 32:4](https://ref.ly/Deut32:4); [Judges 5:11](https://ref.ly/Judg5:11); [Psalm 103:6](https://ref.ly/Ps103:6)). God's people rejoiced in his righteous acts ([Psalm 89:16](https://ref.ly/Ps89:16)). Because God is righteous, he expects righteousness from others, reflecting his nature. Righteousness means following God's rule and will. 

Noah is called "righteous" because he walked with God and showed integrity compared to others ([Genesis 6:9](https://ref.ly/Gen6:9)). After humanity's fall—when people disobeyed God and brought sin into the world, leading to the flood and the scattering at Babel—God renewed His relationship with people through Abraham and his descendants. Abraham was righteous because he lived by God's revealed will ([Genesis 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6); compare [17:1](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1); [18:19](https://ref.ly/Gen18:19); [26:5](https://ref.ly/Gen26:5)).

### The Law and Righteousness

God revealed to Israel how they were to relate to him and each other. The law helped the people live according to God's will and be righteous. A person devoted to God's service was called righteous (compare [Malachi 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mal3:18)). Therefore, righteousness means living rightly before God and others, shown through what we do and say.

The prophets spoke about a future time of righteousness. This would be when God's special chosen king (the Messiah) would rule. It would also be when God's kingdom would come to earth. The prophet Isaiah wrote about this ([Isaiah 11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:9)). He said this rule would spread to all nations (verses [10–16](https://ref.ly/Isa11:10-Isa11:16)) Isaiah also said it would last forever ([Isaiah 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7)). Isaiah described the glorious entrance of God's kingdom, where his enemies are subdued, his people are gathered, and they live in peace. 

Acts of restoration, from Israel's return from exile to the final coming of the kingdom, show God's righteous acts. He forgives, restores, remains faithful, loves, elects, and sends his Spirit to renew his people. He gives them the benefits of the renewed covenant relationship (a special agreement between God and his people). Both Jews and gentiles receive God's righteous acts ([Isaiah 45:8, 23](https://ref.ly/Isa45:8,Isa45:23); [46:13, 48:18](https://ref.ly/Isa46:13,Isa46:48); [51:5, 8, 16](https://ref.ly/Isa51:5,Isa51:8,Isa51:16); [56:1](https://ref.ly/Isa56:1); [59:17](https://ref.ly/Isa59:17); [60:17](https://ref.ly/Isa60:17); [61:10](https://ref.ly/Isa61:10-Isa61:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa61:10-Isa61:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Isa61:10-Isa61:11)).

Righteousness in the New Testament
----------------------------------

God was concerned about his people's salvation and his everlasting kingdom. So, God revealed his righteousness by sending his Son. The coming of Christ marks the renewal of God's relationship with people, the covenant, and his kingdom on earth. The older covenant, mediated by Moses, was renewed by the Son of God, who came “to fulfill all righteousness” ([Matthew 3:15](https://ref.ly/Matt3:15)). Jesus's message aligns with the Old Testament in identifying God's kingdom with his righteousness ([Matthew 6:33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33); [13:43](https://ref.ly/Matt13:43)). Jesus taught that God expects everyone to live in harmony with his will ([Matthew 7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21)). Jesus is God's final revelation of what he requires for people to enter the kingdom and live righteously.

### Justification and Righteousness

Individuals cannot attain this righteousness by their own efforts; it is a gift from God ([Romans 3:21–5:21](https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom5:21)). There is no righteousness apart from Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus reveals that “The righteous will live by faith” ([Romans 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17); compare [Hebrews 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4)). Therefore, the Father requires acceptance of his Son as his means of justification ([Romans 3:25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25-Rom3:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25-Rom3:26)[26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25-Rom3:26); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9)). Justification is when God declares people righteous when they trust in his Son ([Romans 8:33](https://ref.ly/Rom8:33-Rom8:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom8:33-Rom8:34)[34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:33-Rom8:34); [2 Corinthians 3:18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:18); [11:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:15)). God pardons sins, reconciles with sinners, and grants them peace ([Romans 5:1, 9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1,Rom5:9-Rom5:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1)[11](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1,Rom5:9-Rom5:11); [Ephesians 2:14](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:17)). Those declared righteous enjoy a new relationship as "sons of God" by adoption. The Father relates righteously to his children and expects them to relate righteously to him.

### Future Fulfillment of Righteousness

When Jesus returns, we will see true righteousness in full. At that time, all those who God has made right with himself will also be glorified ([Romans 8:30](https://ref.ly/Rom8:30)). God's plan for saving people is moving toward a final goal. This goal is when God's kingdom will fully appear. At that time, God will renew all creation in "righteousness"—that is, all creation will be right with God ([2 Peter 3:13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13)).
