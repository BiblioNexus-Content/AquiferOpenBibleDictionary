BEER\-LAHAI\-ROI
================

A well between Kadesh and Bered where Hagar was confronted by the angel of the Lord when she was pregnant with Ishmael ([Genesis 16:7](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7-Gen16:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7-Gen16:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Gen16:7-Gen16:14)). Beer\-lahai\-roi means “the well of the Living One who sees me,” This refers to God’s appearance to Sarai’s servant girl. Later, Isaac often used it as a watering place on his travels ([Genesis 24:62](https://ref.ly/Gen24:62); [25:11](https://ref.ly/Gen25:11)).
