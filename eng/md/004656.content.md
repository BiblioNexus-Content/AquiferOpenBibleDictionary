## Rakkath (id: 7918)

RAKKATH
=======

One of 19 cities allotted to Naphtali’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 19:35](https://ref.ly/Josh19:35)). The city served as a buffer against military attack on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jewish tradition identifies Rakkath with Tiberias, but modern scholars prefer its location at either Khirbet el\-Quneitireh or Tell Eklatiyah.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 19:35
