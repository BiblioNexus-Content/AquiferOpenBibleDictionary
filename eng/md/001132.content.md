## Calamus (id: 4386)

CALAMUS
=======

A sweet\-smelling cane plant ([Exodus 30:23](https://ref.ly/Exod30:23); [Ezekiel 27:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:19)). Calamus refers to either a plant or its aromatic root. It was one of the plants that grew in Solomon's garden ([Song of Solomon 4:14](https://ref.ly/Song4:14)).

Two plants have been suggested as the source of biblical calamus: 

* the sweet flag (*Acorus calamus*), and
* the beardgrass (*Andropogon aromaticus*).

The sweet flag has a strong pleasant smell and grows in Europe and Asia, but it is not found in Israel and the surrounding areas. Beardgrass, which comes from India, releases a strong fragrance when crushed and is thought to be the calamus mentioned in the Bible. Beardgrass produces an oil called ginger\-grass oil.
