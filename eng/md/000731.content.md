## Barachiah, Barachias (id: 4000)

BARACHIAH, BARACHIAS
====================

The name given to Zechariah’s father in the New Testament ([Matthew 23:35](https://ref.ly/Matt23:35)). Zechariah was executed in the temple by order of King Joash, but was said to be the son of Jehoiada ([2 Chronicles 24:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22)[22](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22)). “Son of Barachiah” might be a copyist’s addition, since in a similar passage in Luke’s Gospel ([Luke 11:51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:51)) the name does not appear in the most reliable manuscripts. A copyist may have confused the martyred Zechariah with the prophet Zechariah, whose father was Berechiah ([Zechariah 1:1, 7](https://ref.ly/Zech1:1,Zech1:7)).
