## Timnath-Heres, Timnath-Serah (id: 8849)

TIMNATH\-HERES\*, TIMNATH\-SERAH
================================

The city that Joshua the son of Nun asked for and that was given to him as his inheritance when the land was divided among the tribes of Israel ([Jos 19:49–50](https://ref.ly/Josh19:49-Josh19:50)). Joshua rebuilt the city and settled there. When Joshua died, he was buried on the property located in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash ([Jos 24:30](https://ref.ly/Josh24:30)). [Judges 2:9](https://ref.ly/Judg2:9) gives the same location, but the name is Timnath\-heres (see nlt mg), which means “territory \[or portion] of the sun.” This seems to indicate that the city used to be a place for sun worship.
