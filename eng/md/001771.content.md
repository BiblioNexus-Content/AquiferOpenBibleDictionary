## Elishah (id: 5022)

ELISHAH
=======

Javan’s son ([Gn 10:4](https://ref.ly/Gen10:4); [1 Chr 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:7)). The Hebrew term for Greece is Javan; hence, Elishah could be the term for the western Aegean islands or coastlands (cf. [Gn 10:5](https://ref.ly/Gen10:5)) that supplied dye stuffs to the inhabitants of Tyre ([Ez 27:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:7)). The Jewish historian Josephus identified Elishah with the Aeolians; other suggestions are Carthage in North Africa, Hellas, Italy, and Elis. A Mediterranean site seems probable from the context of [Ezekiel 27:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:6-Ezek27:7), perhaps an area of Cyprus that exported copper.
