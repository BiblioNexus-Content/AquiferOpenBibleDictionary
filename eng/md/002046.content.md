FOUNDATION GATE
===============

Structure mentioned in [2 Chronicles 23:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:5), in the narrative about Queen Athaliah’s execution. The parallel passage in [2 Kings 11:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:6) reads “Sur Gate,” while the Septuagint has “gate of the ways,” indicating some difficulties within the Hebrew text.
