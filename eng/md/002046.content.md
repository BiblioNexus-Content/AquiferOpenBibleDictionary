## Fowler (id: 5301)

FOWLER\*
========

One who traps or shoots wild birds. The catching of birds for pets, food, and sacrifices was the business of the fowler. This was done by the use of a bow and arrow, a sling, or a net ([Prv 1:17](https://ref.ly/Prov1:17); [Ez 12:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek12:13); [17:20](https://ref.ly/Ezek17:20); [Hos 7:12](https://ref.ly/Hos7:12); [9:8](https://ref.ly/Hos9:8)). Other methods included the use of bird lime, a sticky substance to which birds adhere, and a throw stick that broke the birds’ legs. Fowlers lay in wait near their trap, placing the captured birds in a basket ([Jer 5:26–27](https://ref.ly/Jer5:26-Jer5:27)). The term “fowler” appears also as a metaphor for wicked men who trap other men ([Pss 91:3](https://ref.ly/Ps91:3); [124:7](https://ref.ly/Ps124:7); [Jer 5:26](https://ref.ly/Jer5:26); [Hos 9:8](https://ref.ly/Hos9:8)).
