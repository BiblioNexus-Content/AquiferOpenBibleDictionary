## Destiny (id: 4819)

DESTINY
=======

1. A pagan god (Meni) mentioned in connection with another pagan god (Gad). This god was probably a god of good luck or fortune ([Isaiah 65:11](https://ref.ly/Isa65:11)).
2. The determined future of the Hebrews as God’s chosen people ([Exodus 19:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5-Exod19:6)). In the New Testament, eternal destiny depends upon a person’s relationship with Jesus ([Acts 17:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:30-Acts17:31); [1 John 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/1John5:1-1John5:5)).
