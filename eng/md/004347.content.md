Types of Paths in the Bible
---------------------------

"Path" and "pathway" are used to translate a variety of words used in the Bible: 

1. a well\-trodden and much\-used roadway ([Genesis 49:17](https://ref.ly/Gen49:17); [Psalms 16:11](https://ref.ly/Ps16:11); [139:3](https://ref.ly/Ps139:3); [Proverbs 2:8, 19](https://ref.ly/Prov2:8,Prov2:19))
2. a thoroughfare or highway ([Joel 2:8](https://ref.ly/Joel2:8))
3. a beaten track as across fields, over hills, and through valleys ([Job 30:13](https://ref.ly/Job30:13); [Psalms 119:35](https://ref.ly/Ps119:35); [Proverbs 3:17](https://ref.ly/Prov3:17))
4. a track or passage in which the idea of flowing along is included ([Psalms 77:19](https://ref.ly/Ps77:19); [Jeremiah 18:15](https://ref.ly/Jer18:15))
5. a circular path, as in a trench or in a parapet ([Psalms 65:11](https://ref.ly/Ps65:11); [Proverbs 2:9](https://ref.ly/Prov2:9))
6. a narrow passage, as through a hole ([Numbers 22:24](https://ref.ly/Num22:24)).

“Path” is used to translate the Greek words meaning a worn track ([Matthew 3:3](https://ref.ly/Matt3:3); [Mark 1:3](https://ref.ly/Mark1:3); [Luke 3:4](https://ref.ly/Luke3:4)) and a wheel rut ([Hebrews 12:13](https://ref.ly/Heb12:13)).

The Bible uses the words "path" or "pathway" to discuss a stretch of ground over which traffic passes. This could be in the form of a crooked mountain path, an unpaved and much\-traveled way, or a pavement.
