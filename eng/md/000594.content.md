ATHBASH
=======

A Hebrew cryptograph, a secret writing system used to hide messages. 

* The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is replaced by the last letter.
* The second letter is replaced by the next\-to\-last letter.
* This pattern continues for all letters.

This secret writing system was used in [Jeremiah 51:1](https://ref.ly/Jer51:1) for the word “Chaldea." It was also used in [Jeremiah 25:26](https://ref.ly/Jer25:26) and [51:41](https://ref.ly/Jer51:41) for the word “Babylon” (written as “Sheshach.”) 

The Septuagint, the early Greek translation of the Old Testament, correctly translated these codes as “Chaldea” and “Babylon” respectively.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 25:26; JER 51:1; JER 51:41
