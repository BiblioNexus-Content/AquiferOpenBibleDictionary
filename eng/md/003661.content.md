## Manahath (Place), Manahathite (id: 6915)

MANAHATH (Place), MANAHATHITE
=============================

Evidently a place in the Judean hills near the Benjamite border ([1 Chr 8:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:6)). The Manahathites ([1 Chr 2:54](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54)), the people of Manahath, had connections with the Judean and Calebite clans in northern Judea. Its site is apparently that of Malha, three miles (4\.8 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem on the northern slope of the valley of Rephaim.
