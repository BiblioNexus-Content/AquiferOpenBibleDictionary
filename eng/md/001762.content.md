## Elimelech (id: 5013)

ELIMELECH
=========

Man from Bethlehem who took his wife, Naomi, and his sons, Mahlon and Chilion, to sojourn in Moab because of famine in Judah ([Ru 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:2-Ruth1:3)). While in Moab, he died; then his sons also died; and Naomi decided to return to Judah. One daughter\-in\-law, Orpah, preferred to remain in Moab; the other, Ruth, chose to accompany Naomi. Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, bought Elimelech’s land and married Ruth ([4:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:9-Ruth4:10)). From this union came a great\-grandson, David, and the royal line in which the Messiah would eventually be born. *See* Ruth, Book of.
