## Tychicus (id: 8947)

TYCHICUS
========

One of the believers who accompanied Paul in his trip to collect and deliver the offering for the Jerusalem church ([Acts 20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). Since he is often mentioned with Trophimus of Ephesus, Tychicus was likely also a native of that city. 

Tychicus delivered Paul’s letter to Ephesus ([Ephesians 6:21](https://ref.ly/Eph6:21)) as well as Paul’s letters to Philemon and the Colossians ([Colossians 4:7](https://ref.ly/Col4:7)). Most believe that he was also one of the two Christians (with Trophimus) who accompanied Titus in the delivery of 2 Corinthians ([2 Corinthians 8:16–24](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:16-2Cor8:24)). 

Paul mentioned Tychicus twice in his later letters, first sending him to Crete to be with Titus ([Titus 3:12](https://ref.ly/Titus3:12)). Later he mentioned to Timothy that he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus ([2 Timothy 4:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:12)). Evidently, Tychicus and Paul were close friends as well as coworkers, since Paul frequently referred to Tychicus as a “beloved brother.”
