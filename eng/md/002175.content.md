## Gershon, Gershonites (id: 5431)

GERSHON, GERSHONITES
====================

Levi’s oldest son (also spelled Gershom) who went into Egypt with Israel ([Genesis 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11); [Numbers 3:17](https://ref.ly/Num3:17); [1 Chronicles 6:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1)). He became the ancestor of a group of Levites called the Gershonites who left Egypt with Moses ([Exodus 6:16–17](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16-Exod6:17); [Numbers 3:18, 21](https://ref.ly/Num3:18,Num3:21)).

When the Levitical cities were given out, the Gershonites were listed as one of the largest Levitical groups in Israel ([Joshua 21:1–7](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:7)). Some Bible passages show that they were sometimes the main working group among the Levites ([Genesis 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11); [Exodus 6:16](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16); [Numbers 3:17](https://ref.ly/Num3:17); [26:57](https://ref.ly/Num26:57); [1 Chronicles 6:1, 16](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1,1Chr6:16); [23:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6)).

According to the book of Numbers, the Gershonites camped behind the tabernacle on the west side during the wilderness journey ([Numbers 3:23](https://ref.ly/Num3:23)). Early in the second year after leaving Egypt, there were about 7,500 Gershonite males ([Numbers 3:22](https://ref.ly/Num3:22)). Only men between the ages of 30 and 50 could serve in the tabernacle. At the time of that early counting, there were 2,630 such men ([Numbers 4:39–40](https://ref.ly/Num4:39-Num4:40)). They were responsible for taking care of and moving the outside parts of the tabernacle ([Numbers 3:25–26](https://ref.ly/Num3:25-Num3:26); [4:24, 27–28](https://ref.ly/Num4:24,Num4:27-Num4:28)). They were given two wagons and four oxen for this work, and Aaron and his sons supervised them ([Numbers 4:27](https://ref.ly/Num4:27)).

After the Israelites first settled in Canaan, the Gershonites received 13 cities in the northern part of the land. These cities were located in the tribal areas of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh ([Joshua 21:6](https://ref.ly/Josh21:6)).

During the time of King David, the Gershonites were among the Levites appointed to serve in the temple ([1 Chronicles 23:6–11](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6-1Chr23:11)). The Gershonite families of Ladan and Jehieli were in charge of the treasury of God's house ([1 Chronicles 26:20–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:20-1Chr26:22)). At David's request, Asaph and his family, who were Gershonites, helped direct the music in the temple ([1 Chronicles 25:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:2)). During King Hezekiah's reign, the Gershonites were among the Levites who cleaned the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:1–6, 12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:1-2Chr29:6,2Chr29:12)). After the exile in Babylon, the descendants of Asaph played music to celebrate the laying of the temple foundation and the dedication of the city walls ([Ezra 3:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:10); [Nehemiah 12:31–36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:31-Neh12:36)).
