GERSHOM
=======

2. Jonathan’s father. He and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan. The people of Dan made a carved statue to worship as a god, breaking God's command against idols. They chose Jonathan, Gershom's son, to be their priest and lead their worship ([Judges 18:30](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30)).
3. An alternate spelling of Gershon, Levi’s oldest son ([1 Chronicles 6:1, 16–17, 20, 43](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1,1Chr6:16-1Chr6:17,1Chr6:20,1Chr6:43); [23:6–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6-1Chr23:7)).
