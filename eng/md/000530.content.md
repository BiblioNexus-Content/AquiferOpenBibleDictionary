## Asher (Person) (id: 3798)

ASHER (Person)
==============

Jacob’s son born to Leah’s maid Zilpah ([Genesis 30:12](https://ref.ly/Gen30:12-Gen30:13)–[13](https://ref.ly/Gen30:12-Gen30:13)). The name Asher likely means "happy." It was chosen by Leah to express her joy at his birth. Asher had four sons—Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah—and a daughter named Serah ([Genesis 46:17](https://ref.ly/Gen46:17); [1 Chronicles 7:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:30)). 

Some believe the tribe of Asher may have been named after a location mentioned in Egyptian texts from the 13th century BC. However, it is more probable that the tribe was named after its ancestor. Asher and his brothers received special blessings and prophecies from Jacob as he was dying ([Genesis 49:20](https://ref.ly/Gen49:20); compare [Deuteronomy 33:24](https://ref.ly/Deut33:24-Deut33:25)–[25](https://ref.ly/Deut33:24-Deut33:25), where Moses also blessed Asher and the other tribes).
