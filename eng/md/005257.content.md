## Singer (id: 8515)

SINGER
======

The professional singer was important in temple worship. David first organized singers for worship in the tabernacle ([1 Chr 9:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:33); [15:16, 19, 27](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:16,1Chr15:19,1Chr15:27)). Later, they ministered in Solomon’s temple ([2 Chr 5:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12-2Chr5:13)) and for other kings ([20:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:21); [23:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:13); [35:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:15)). After the exile, the singers were again active ([Ezr 2:41, 70](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:41,Ezra2:70); [Neh 7:1, 44, 73](https://ref.ly/Neh7:1,Neh7:44,Neh7:73); [10:28, 39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:28,Neh10:39)). They sang psalms for temple worship ([Pss 68:25](https://ref.ly/Ps68:25); [87:7](https://ref.ly/Ps87:7)). Some were appointed “chief singers” ([Hb 3:19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:19)). The sons of Asaph were prominent among them.
