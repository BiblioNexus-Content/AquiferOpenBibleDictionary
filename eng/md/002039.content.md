## Forgetfulness, Land of (id: 5293)

FORGETFULNESS, Land of
======================

Euphemism for the abode of the dead. Once in the land of forgetfulness, the dead are thought to be forgotten by God ([Ps 88:12](https://ref.ly/Ps88:12)) and people ([Eccl 9:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:5-Eccl9:6)) alike. [Job 14:21–22](https://ref.ly/Job14:21-Job14:22), suggests, however, that the deceased retain some self\-consciousness in Sheol.
