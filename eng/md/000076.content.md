ACHAICUS
========

An early Christian convert in Corinth. Achaicus, Stephanas, and Fortunatus were visiting Paul in Ephesus when he wrote 1 Corinthians ([1 Corinthians 16:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:17)). Achaicus and his friends probably brought Paul a letter from the Corinthian church and returned with Paul’s reply ([1 Corinthians 7:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:1)).
