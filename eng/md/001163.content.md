## Capital (id: 4420)

CAPITAL
=======

In architecture (building design), the capital is the top part of a pillar. Capitals are often decorated with detailed designs. Capitals (“chapiter” in the King James Version) were on top of the five pillars of the tabernacle during the Israelite's wandering in the wilderness ([Exodus 36:38](https://ref.ly/Exod36:38)). They were also on top of the pillars called “Boaz” and “Jachin” in Solomon's temple ([1 Kings 7:16–22, 40–42](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:16-1Kgs7:22,1Kgs7:40-1Kgs7:42)).
