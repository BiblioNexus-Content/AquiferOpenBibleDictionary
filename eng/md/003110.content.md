JEWISH LITERATURE, Extrabiblical
================================

Ancient Jewish writings that are not part of the Bible but help us understand Jewish history, beliefs, and practices. These texts were written between around 200 BC and AD 500\. They include:

1. The Mishnah: A collection of Jewish laws and traditions that were passed down orally before being written down around AD 200\. These laws explain how to follow the commandments found in the Old Testament.
2. The Talmud: A very large collection of Jewish teachings and discussions about the law. It contains the Mishnah plus extensive commentary from Jewish teachers. There are two versions: the Jerusalem Talmud (completed around AD 400\) and the Babylonian Talmud (completed around AD 500\).
3. The Targums: Translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic (the common language of many Jewish people at that time). These translations often include additional explanations to help readers understand the text.

These writings are important because they show us how Jewish people understood and practiced their faith in ancient times. They also help us better understand the world Jesus lived in.
