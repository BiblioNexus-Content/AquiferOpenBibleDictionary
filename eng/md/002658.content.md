## Hormah (id: 5905)

HORMAH
======

A town near Beersheba in the Negev. It was on the border of the tribes of Judah and Simeon. 

At first, it was a Canaanite settlement. Then it belonged to the tribe of Judah, and then to the tribe of Simeon ([Joshua 15:30](https://ref.ly/Josh15:30); [19:4, 9](https://ref.ly/Josh19:4,Josh19:9)). By the time Israel had its first kings, Judah controlled this area again ([1 Samuel 30:30](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:30)). 

The Canaanite name "Zephath" changed to "Hormah" when the Hebrews first conquered it ([Judges 1:17](https://ref.ly/Judg1:17)). Hormah became loyal to David during his ongoing feud with King Saul. David rewarded the town by sending it some of the war spoils of Ziklag ([1 Samuel 30](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:1-1Sam30:31)). 

[Joshua 15:30](https://ref.ly/Josh15:30) describes Hormah as being in the south near Kesil and Ziklag. But its exact location remains unknown. From the reference in [Numbers 14:45](https://ref.ly/Num14:45), it could be south of Kadesh\-barnea. This is where the Israelites spent much of the wilderness period.
