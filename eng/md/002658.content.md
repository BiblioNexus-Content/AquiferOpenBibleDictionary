## Horn (id: 5908)

HORN
====

1. A musical instrument often made from a ram’s horn. *See* Musical Instruments (Hatzotzrot).
2. A symbol of power in the Bible ([1 Kings 22:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:11)). Horns can represent:

    * dominance over the weak ([Ezekiel 34:21](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:21)),
        * forces of destruction ([Zechariah 1:18–21](https://ref.ly/Zech1:18-Zech1:21)), and
        * freedom from oppression ([1 Kings 22:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:11); [2 Chronicles 18:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:10)).
        Thus, the horn has two meanings: rescue and force ([2 Samuel 22:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:3); [Psalm 18:2](https://ref.ly/Ps18:2)). The growing of the horn referred to in [Psalm 132:17](https://ref.ly/Ps132:17) could mean the continuation of the kingly line. [Psalm 75:10](https://ref.ly/Ps75:10) says that the horns of the wicked will be cut off, but the horns of the righteous will be exalted. The symbolic imagery in Daniel and Revelation shows that horns represent power and authority ([Daniel 7–8](https://ref.ly/Dan7:1-Dan8:27); [Revelation 13](https://ref.ly/Rev13:1-Rev13:18), [17](https://ref.ly/Rev17:1-Rev17:18)).

3. A container for liquids. People used ram’s horns, goat’s horns, and wild ox horns to hold liquids. These horns were also special containers for oil used in ceremonies ([1 Samuel 16:1, 13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:1,1Sam16:13); [1 Kings 1:39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:39)). Cow horns were not allowed to be used for any religious or ceremonial use.
4. Four horn\-shaped projections that stuck out from the four corners of the tabernacle and temple altars ([Exodus 27:2](https://ref.ly/Exod27:2); [30:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod30:2-Exod30:3)). These altar horns were covered with sacrificial blood and marked an area of sanctuary ([Exodus 29:12](https://ref.ly/Exod29:12); [Leviticus 4:7, 18](https://ref.ly/Lev4:7,Lev4:18); [1 Kings 1:50–51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:50-1Kgs1:51)).
