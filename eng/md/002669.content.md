## Hosea, Book of (id: 5917)

BOOK OF HOSEA
=============

Hosea is the first of the 12 minor prophets in the traditional order of Old Testament books. It was written in the late eighth century BC. 

Hosea prophesied to the northern kingdom of Israel during its last years. He was the only prophet who lived and preached in the northern kingdom. God chose Hosea to expose the widespread abandonment of faith and corruption there. Hosea urged his fellow citizens to repent (stop doing wrong) and return to God. Through his own life, he showed the faithful, unbreakable love that God had for Israel.

Who Wrote the Book of Hosea?
----------------------------

Hosea's ministry lasted at least 38 years, from around 753 to 715 BC. He seemed knowledgeable, regardless of whether he was a peasant or from a wealthy class in Israel.

Hosea's marriage to the prostitute Gomer was likely controversial in his time. It has also caused great controversy among Bible students and commentators. It is best to understand that Gomer was a well\-known prostitute. Hosea was commanded to marry her as a symbol of Israel's unfaithfulness and God's unwavering covenant love.

Is the Book of Hosea Authentic?
-------------------------------

Most scholars agree on the authenticity and unity of Hosea. However, there are two areas of controversy: 

1. The passages that mention Judah (for example, [Hosea 1:1, 7, 11](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1,Hos1:7,Hos1:11); [4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15); [5:5, 10–14](https://ref.ly/Hos5:5,Hos5:10-Hos5:14); [6:4, 11](https://ref.ly/Hos6:4,Hos6:11); [8:14](https://ref.ly/Hos8:14); [11:12](https://ref.ly/Hos11:12); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Hos12:2))
2. The sections that talk about future blessings or national deliverance (for example, [Hosea 11:8–11](https://ref.ly/Hos11:8-Hos11:11); [14:2–9](https://ref.ly/Hos14:2-Hos14:9))

Hosea's mentions of Judah are understandable. He was a man of God upset by Israel's split from the rightful Davidic line. The northern kingdom, led by ungodly kings, faced God's judgment. Hosea had received divine insight about God's plans for both Judah and Israel.

The future blessings and deliverance of Israel do not cancel out the condemnation of Israel's sins. This is similar to how Hosea's love and reconciliation with unfaithful Gomer do not erase her wrongdoing. Restoration and forgiveness do not mean ignoring guilt.

What Is the Story of the Book of Hosea?
---------------------------------------

Hosea lived during the prosperous times of Israel's northern kingdom under King Jeroboam II from 793 to 753 BC. He also witnessed its defeat and the people's deportation after the Assyrian invasion in 722 BC.

[Hosea 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1) mentions these kings from Judah: 

* Uzziah
* Jotham
* Ahaz
* Hezekiah

This verse also. mentions two kings from Israel:

* Joash
* Jeroboam

Uzziah ruled at the same time as Joash and Jeroboam. Ahaz was the king of Judah when Assyria captured Israel. Hezekiah might have ruled alongside Ahaz during the Assyrian captivity.

Jeroboam ruled Israel for 41 years, following the evil ways of his father, Nebat ([2 Kings 14:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:23-2Kgs14:24)). Although Israel was prosperous during Jeroboam's reign, government corruption and spiritual decline set the stage for future turmoil. This paved the way for Israel's fall. The rich landowners, including the king, oppressed the peasants, forcing lower\-class landowners to move from farms to cities. These social issues soon led to widespread corruption in Israel. Anarchy resulted from these times ([Hosea 4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1-Hos4:2); [7:1–7](https://ref.ly/Hos7:1-Hos7:7); [8:3–4](https://ref.ly/Hos8:3-Hos8:4); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Hos9:15)).

When Was the Book of Hosea Written?
-----------------------------------

Hosea started his work as a God's messenger during the reign of Jeroboam II, from 793 to 753 BC. He continued until the reign of Hezekiah of Judah, from 715 to 686 BC.

Several factors suggest that Hosea continued to prophesy during the reign of Hoshea of Israel, from 732 to 722 BC: 

1. "Shalman" ([Hosea 10:14](https://ref.ly/Hos10:14)) might be Shalmaneser of Assyria, who invaded Israel early in Hoshea's reign ([2 Kings 17:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:3))
2. "Jareb" ([Hosea 5:13](https://ref.ly/Hos5:13); [10:6](https://ref.ly/Hos10:6); both from the Kings James Version) might refer to Sargon II, who ruled from 722 to 705 BC
3. Predictions of the Assyrian invasion seem to describe an event about to happen ([Hosea 10:5–6](https://ref.ly/Hos10:5-Hos10:6); [13:15–16](https://ref.ly/Hos13:15-Hos13:16))
4. Mentions of Egypt and Israel's reliance on that nation appear to match Hoshea's reign ([Hosea 7:11](https://ref.ly/Hos7:11); [11:11](https://ref.ly/Hos11:11))

These factors suggest that Hosea's messages were gathered together close to Israel's fall in 722 BC.

Where Was the Book of Hosea Written? Who Was It Written For?
------------------------------------------------------------

Hosea prophesied while living in Israel. He calls the king in Samaria "our king" ([Hosea 7:5](https://ref.ly/Hos7:5)). His descriptions of Israel show he knew the geography of the northern kingdom well. Hosea mentions Gilead as if he had seen the area himself ([Hosea 6:8](https://ref.ly/Hos6:8); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Hos12:11)). Hosea was likely the only prophet to the northern kingdom who lived there during his entire ministry.

Why Was the Book of Hosea Written?
----------------------------------

Hosea told Israel to repent and return to God. He described the God of Israel as patient and loving, always faithful to his promises. This focus is typical of Hosea (see [Hosea 2:19](https://ref.ly/Hos2:19)).

"Loving devotion" is the phrase that best represents Yahweh's faithful love. Hosea's family life was a symbol of this loving devotion.

What Is the Book of Hosea About?
--------------------------------

The main sections and topics of the book of Hosea are outlined as follows.

### Chapters 1–3

The first three chapters of Hosea focus on Hosea's life. They highlight his faithfulness and love for his unfaithful wife.

God told Hosea to marry the prostitute Gomer and have children with her ([Hosea 1:2–3:5](https://ref.ly/Hos1:2-Hos3:5)). This command has puzzled some commentators because priests and prophets in Israel did not marry prostitutes. Medieval Jewish writers saw this story as symbolic but not historical. Some later scholars saw a difference between [Hosea 1](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos1:11) and [3](https://ref.ly/Hos3:1-Hos3:5), viewing the latter as Hosea's personal account of his marriage, while the first chapter was seen as general memories of his early days as a prophet. Other commentators believed both chapters were literal facts, while some scholars thought [Hosea 1](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos1:11) was historical and [Hosea 3](https://ref.ly/Hos3:1-Hos3:5) was Hosea's allegorical (not literal) interpretation of the marriage.

People have widely discussed Gomer's sexual activities. Two main views exist: 

1. Gomer was a faithful wife to Hosea in their early marriage. The phrase “a prostitute as your wife” ([Hosea 1:2](https://ref.ly/Hos1:2)) refers to her sinful and rebellious nature. God later exposed this to show Israel’s idolatry.
2. Gomer was a known harlot whom Hosea was told to marry to show Israel’s idolatry and God’s faithful love. This second view appeals most to evangelical scholars and is the simplest interpretation within a literal, grammatical, and historical Bible framework.

The reason Hosea needed to ransom her is unclear. It is also unknown why the payment was partly in grain and partly in money. This transaction might symbolize God's future deliverance of Israel from exile. However, the ten northern tribes did not return from exile in Assyria. This interpretation likely does not apply to Judah, since Hosea's message was not for the southern kingdom, although Judah did receive a warning ([Hosea 6:11](https://ref.ly/Hos6:11)).

The children born to Hosea and Gomer received symbolic names. The first child was a son named Jezreel ([Hosea 1:4a](https://ref.ly/Hos1:4)). This name signified God's judgment on Jehu's family for Jehu's killing of Ahab's family in the valley of Jezreel ([2 Kings 10:1–11, 30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1-2Kgs10:11,2Kgs10:30)).

Lo\-ruhamah was the second child ([Hosea 1:6a](https://ref.ly/Hos1:6)), and her name means "not shown compassion or pity." This symbolized the judgment of Israel. The spiritual corruption of the northern kingdom had reached its end, and it would be defeated and taken into captivity ([Hosea 1:6b](https://ref.ly/Hos1:6)).

*Lo\-ammi* was the third child, a second son, and his name means "not My people" ([Hosea 1:8–9](https://ref.ly/Hos1:8-Hos1:9)). This rejection of Israel as God's chosen people was temporary ([Hosea 1:10–2:1](https://ref.ly/Hos1:10-Hos2:1)). God would fulfill His promises to Abraham ([Hosea 1:10](https://ref.ly/Hos1:10); [Genesis 22:17](https://ref.ly/Gen22:17)) and to Moses ([Exodus 19:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod19:7)) despite the disobedience of any particular generation.

Gomer was not happy with her marriage, so she looked for other lovers. Similarly, Israel sought satisfaction by worshipping false gods. They wrongly credited the good things from their merciful God to these pagan gods ([Hosea 2:8, 12](https://ref.ly/Hos2:8,Hos2:12)). Once they realized their sins brought no lasting happiness, repentant Israelites would return to their first love.

Hosea's declaration of divorce from Gomer due to her adultery symbolizes Yahweh's divorce from Israel for her unfaithfulness ([Hosea 2:2](https://ref.ly/Hos2:2); see also [Jeremiah 3:1–4:2](https://ref.ly/Jer3:1-Jer4:2)). Their children represent the individual members of the nation of Israel during Hosea's time ([Hosea 2:2–5](https://ref.ly/Hos2:2-Hos2:5)).

[Hosea 3](https://ref.ly/Hos3:1-Hos3:5) uses restoration to summarize Israel's history. Israel's slavery to sin and Satan (see [Hebrews 2:14–15](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14-Heb2:15)) is shown by the price Hosea paid for Gomer ([Hosea 3:2](https://ref.ly/Hos3:2)). This price was for a female slave because Gomer was enslaved by her adultery (see [Exodus 21:32](https://ref.ly/Exod21:32)). Gomer's isolation, like Israel's exile, was meant for cleansing ([Hosea 3:3](https://ref.ly/Hos3:3); see [Deuteronomy 21:13](https://ref.ly/Deut21:13); [30:2](https://ref.ly/Deut30:2)).

After the exile in Babylon ("afterward"), and "in the last days," Israel will return to her husband to enjoy the blessings of the renewed relationship. In a reference to the Messiah, "David their king," will be resurrected to lead Israel to the Lord ([Hosea 3:5](https://ref.ly/Hos3:5)).

The last major section of Hosea explains in detail what [Hosea 1–3](https://ref.ly/Hos1:1-Hos3:5) have shown and briefly explained. Hosea prophesies: 

* Israel’s abandonment of faith ([Hosea 4:1–7:16](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1-Hos7:16))
* Punishment ([Hosea 8:1–10:15](https://ref.ly/Hos8:1-Hos10:15))
* Restoration ([Hosea 11:1–14:9](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1-Hos14:9))

### Chapter 4

Israel was deeply involved in ungodly activities and had distanced itself from God ([Hosea 4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1-Hos4:2); compare [Exodus 20:1–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:17)). The people ignored God's word due to their indifference and the priests' deception ([Hosea 4:6–9](https://ref.ly/Hos4:6-Hos4:9); compare [Isaiah 5:13](https://ref.ly/Isa5:13); [Amos 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Amos8:11-Amos8:12); [Zephaniah 1:6](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:6)). Israel followed corrupt spiritual leaders just as their kings followed the corrupt ways of past rulers ([Hosea 4:9](https://ref.ly/Hos4:9)). Instead of God's word, Israel sought guidance from idols and divination ([Hosea 4:12–13](https://ref.ly/Hos4:12-Hos4:13)). Eventually, Israel lost its priestly identity ([Hosea 4:6](https://ref.ly/Hos4:6); compare [Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6)) because the priests were mainly responsible for the nation's departure from faith ([Hosea 5:1](https://ref.ly/Hos5:1)).

### Chapters 5–6

After presenting his case against the northern kingdom, God gives a warning ([Hosea 5:8–14](https://ref.ly/Hos5:8-Hos5:14)). The trumpet will sound in the hills of Benjamin ([Hosea 5:8](https://ref.ly/Hos5:8)), the area between Israel and Judah. The alarm there will show that Israel is being invaded and Judah is at risk ([Hosea 5:9–12](https://ref.ly/Hos5:9-Hos5:12)). The northern kingdom relied on human commands, not God's ([Hosea 5:11](https://ref.ly/Hos5:11)). Israel sought help from Assyria but faced betrayal and defeat ([Hosea 5:13](https://ref.ly/Hos5:13)). In this prophecy about Israel's fall to the Assyrians in 722 BC, Hosea portrays God as the ultimate disciplinarian ([Hosea 5:14](https://ref.ly/Hos5:14)).

God calls for repentance right after revealing punishment ([Hosea 5:15–6:3](https://ref.ly/Hos5:15-Hos6:3)). (The chapter division here is not ideal as [Hosea 6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Hos6:1-Hos6:3) belongs with [5:15](https://ref.ly/Hos5:15).) The call to return to Yahweh might reflect Hosea’s personal response to the revelation. However, it is better to see [Hosea 6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Hos6:1-Hos6:3) as the words of the future returning remnant. Assyria did not offer healing, nor would any other nation, but God will heal Israel spiritually, politically, and physically ([Hosea 6:1](https://ref.ly/Hos6:1); see also [Exodus 15:26](https://ref.ly/Exod15:26); [Deuteronomy 32:39](https://ref.ly/Deut32:39); [Isaiah 53:5](https://ref.ly/Isa53:5); [Ezekiel 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [Malachi 4:2](https://ref.ly/Mal4:2)).

After calling for repentance, God focuses again on Israel ([Hosea 6:4–11](https://ref.ly/Hos6:4-Hos6:11); see also [4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15)). Israel has turned away from its Creator and disobeyed His message ([Hosea 6:7](https://ref.ly/Hos6:7)). Gilead is just one example of Israel's violent nature ([Hosea 6;8](https://ref.ly/Hos6:8)). Even the priests are known for their violence ([Hosea 6:9](https://ref.ly/Hos6:9); see also [1 Samuel 2:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12-1Sam2:17); [Jeremiah 5:31](https://ref.ly/Jer5:31)). Israel's sin is "horrible" ([Hosea 6:10](https://ref.ly/Hos6:10)).

### Chapter 7

[Hosea 7](https://ref.ly/Hos7:1-Hos7:16) shows God's final thoughts about Israel. Every effort by God to make Israel repent only highlights their sin more ([Hosea 7:1](https://ref.ly/Hos7:1)). They think they can sin without God noticing ([Hosea 7:2](https://ref.ly/Hos7:2); see also [Psalm 90:8](https://ref.ly/Ps90:8); [Matthew 12:36–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:36-Matt12:37)). Their leaders are happy that the people are as wicked as the king and princes ([Hosea 7:3](https://ref.ly/Hos7:3)). All of Israel is known for constant adultery ([Hosea 7:4](https://ref.ly/Hos7:4)). Israel has not separated itself from non\-believers ([Hosea 7:8](https://ref.ly/Hos7:8); see also [Exodus 34:12–16](https://ref.ly/Exod34:12-Exod34:16); [2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor7:1)). Like an "unturned cake" ([Hosea 7:8](https://ref.ly/Hos7:8)), Israel is not balanced spiritually or politically, with one side overdone and the other side raw.

In foreign affairs, Israel moved between Egypt and Assyria "like a silly, senseless dove" without understanding ([Hosea 7:11](https://ref.ly/Hos7:11)). They did not seek the Lord's advice when needed but relied on worldly powers. Their lack of faith in Yahweh and failure to separate from sin will lead to God's discipline ([Hosea 7:12](https://ref.ly/Hos7:12); see also [1 Corinthians 11:32](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:32); [Hebrews 12:5–15](https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:15)).

### Chapter 8

[Hosea 8](https://ref.ly/Hos8:1-Hos8:14) discusses Israel facing judgment (see [Hosea 8:7](https://ref.ly/Hos8:7)). An alarm warns the people about the approaching Assyrians ([Hosea 8:1](https://ref.ly/Hos8:1); see also [Ezekiel 17:2–21](https://ref.ly/Ezek17:2-Ezek17:21)). The Assyrians would attack Israel ([Hosea 8:1](https://ref.ly/Hos8:1)) because Israel broke the Sinai covenant (see [Deuteronomy 27:9–29:29](https://ref.ly/Deut27:9-Deut29:29)) and disobeyed the law of Moses. Israel falsely cries to God for help against punishment (see [Isaiah 10:5](https://ref.ly/Isa10:5)), but God does not answer, and Assyria continues to pursue the ten tribes ([Hosea 8:2–3](https://ref.ly/Hos8:2-Hos8:3)). Other reasons for God's judgment include appointing kings without God's guidance ([Hosea 8:4a](https://ref.ly/Hos8:4)) and practicing idolatry ([Hosea 4b–6](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1-Hos6:11)). Israel's sacrifices were unacceptable due to the nation's disobedience (see [1 Samuel 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:22); [Isaiah 1:11–15](https://ref.ly/Isa1:11-Isa1:15)). Therefore, they would go into exile, similar to the earlier exile in Egypt ([Hosea 8:13](https://ref.ly/Hos8:13)).

### Chapter 9

[Hosea 9](https://ref.ly/Hos9:1-Hos9:17) continues the theme of exile. Israel will find no joy ([Hosea 9:1](https://ref.ly/Hos9:1)). The land's produce will not sustain them because they will not live there anymore ([Hosea 9:2–3](https://ref.ly/Hos9:2-Hos9:3)). Some Israelites will flee to Egypt, while others will be taken captive to Assyria. All sacrifices will stop, and they will consume the sacrificial wines and meats for their own needs ([Hosea 9:4–5](https://ref.ly/Hos9:4-Hos9:5)). The Egyptians will kill those Israelites who flee to Egypt ([Hosea 9:6](https://ref.ly/Hos9:6)).

### Chapter 10

[Hosea 10](https://ref.ly/Hos10:1-Hos10:15) further describes the consequences of Israel's wrongdoing. Israel is like a lush vine ([Hosea 10:1](https://ref.ly/Hos10:1)), but its abundance is misused for sacrifices on pagan altars. They are guilty before God, who is about to destroy their altars and remove their king ([Hosea 10:2–3](https://ref.ly/Hos10:2-Hos10:3)). Gibeah is mentioned again ([Hosea 9:9](https://ref.ly/Hos9:9)), reminding Israel that turning away from God is both contagious and permanent ([Hosea 10:9](https://ref.ly/Hos10:9)). The "double transgression" in [Hosea 10:10](https://ref.ly/Hos10:10) may refer to the two calf idols in Bethel and Dan, which brought God's punishment. The penalty will be hard labor under a heavy burden ([Hosea 10:11](https://ref.ly/Hos10:11)).

### Chapters 11–14

Chapters 11 through 14 conclude Hosea's prophecies with a message about Israel's future restoration. The Father's unwavering love is the basis for this future restoration ([Hosea 11:1–12](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1-Hos11:12)). As a nation, Israel was called out of Egypt as Yahweh's son ([Hosea 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1); see also [Exodus 4:22–23](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22-Exod4:23)). However, Israel did not return the Father's love and instead sought alliances with pagans ([Hosea 11:5](https://ref.ly/Hos11:5)), which would lead to judgment ([Hosea 11:5–7](https://ref.ly/Hos11:5-Hos11:7)). Yahweh's words show his unchangeable judgment due to his complete holiness and righteousness ([Hosea 12:1–13:16](https://ref.ly/Hos12:1-Hos13:16)). Israel's sins demand fair punishment ([Hosea 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Hos12:1-Hos12:2)). Israel is responsible for the northern kingdom's destruction. Despite Israel's sin, God can still be her help ([Hosea 13:9](https://ref.ly/Hos13:9)).

Israel should have repented quickly, but she did not ([Hosea 13:13](https://ref.ly/Hos13:13)). However, Yahweh's mercy would eventually end death itself, allowing Israel to live spiritually, politically, and possibly physically ([Hosea 13:14](https://ref.ly/Hos13:14); see also [Ezra 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [Daniel 12:1–2, 13](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:2,Dan12:13)).

[Hosea 14](https://ref.ly/Hos14:1-Hos14:9) of Hosea presents God's loving invitation for Israel to repent and return to him through confession, prayer, and praise ([Hosea 14:2](https://ref.ly/Hos14:2)). The phrase “fruit of our lips” ([Hosea 14:2](https://ref.ly/Hos14:2)) refers to a thank offering, which usually included young bulls ([Exodus 24:5](https://ref.ly/Exod24:5); [Leviticus 7:11–15](https://ref.ly/Lev7:11-Lev7:15); see also [Psalms 51:17–19](https://ref.ly/Ps51:17-Ps51:19); [69:30–31](https://ref.ly/Ps69:30-Ps69:31); [Hebrews 13:15–16](https://ref.ly/Heb13:15-Heb13:16)). Part of Israel’s confession will involve acknowledging that salvation does not come from Assyria (in political alliances) or idols ([Hosea 14:3](https://ref.ly/Hos14:3)).

God repeatedly promises blessings to Israel during their restoration (note “I will,” in [Hosea 14:4–5](https://ref.ly/Hos14:4-Hos14:5)). Yahweh will heal Israel spiritually, love them freely, help them prosper completely, and protect them fully ([Hosea 14:4–7](https://ref.ly/Hos14:4-Hos14:7)). Israel will be as beautiful as the lily, as strong as the cedar, and as fruitful as the olive tree.

What Is the Message of the Book of Hosea?
-----------------------------------------

The main focus of Hosea is in the last verse ([Hosea 14:9](https://ref.ly/Hos14:9)). Wise people will live godly lives, while foolish people will live ungodly lives. Those who live godly lives will experience: 

* Restoration
* Triumph over death ([Hosea 13:14](https://ref.ly/Hos13:14))
* Blessings ([Hosea 14:4–7](https://ref.ly/Hos14:4-Hos14:7))

Idolatry is anything that takes God's place in the human heart. Israel did not seek God's: 

* Guidance
* Help
* Blessing
* Salvation

Instead, Israel turned to: 

* Foreign gods ([Hosea 4:12–19](https://ref.ly/Hos4:12-Hos4:19))
* National pride ([Hosea 5:5](https://ref.ly/Hos5:5))
* Religious rituals ([Hosea 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6))
* Political convenience ([Hosea 7:3](https://ref.ly/Hos7:3))
* Political alliances ([Hosea 7:11](https://ref.ly/Hos7:11))
* Civil government ([Hosea 8:4](https://ref.ly/Hos8:4))
* Construction projects ([Hosea 8:14](https://ref.ly/Hos8:14))
* Selfish wealth ([Hosea 10:1](https://ref.ly/Hos10:1))
* Idol worship ([Hosea 13:2](https://ref.ly/Hos13:2))

They could find true blessing and security only in God ([Hosea 13:4, 9](https://ref.ly/Hos13:4,Hos13:9); [14:4–7](https://ref.ly/Hos14:4-Hos14:7)).

Hosea describes apostasy (abandoning one's faith) as contagious. It can start with either spiritual leaders or the people and then spread between them ([Hosea 4:9](https://ref.ly/Hos4:9)). The punishment for apostasy depends on how much responsibility someone has ([Hosea 5:1](https://ref.ly/Hos5:1); [13:9](https://ref.ly/Hos13:9); [14:4](https://ref.ly/Hos14:4)).
