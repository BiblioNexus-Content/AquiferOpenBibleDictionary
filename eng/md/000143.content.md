## Adullam, Adullamite (id: 3403)

ADULLAM, ADULLAMITE
===================

An old Canaanite city between Lachish and Hebron. It also is the name of a cave region nearby. 

The first reference to the city in the Bible is in the word "Adullamite" (someone from Adullam). It is used to describe Hirah, a friend of Judah. After Judah helped sell his brother Joseph into slavery, Judah left home and lived in Adullam with Hirah ([Genesis 38:1, 12, 20](https://ref.ly/Gen38:1,Gen38:12,Gen38:20)).

Adullam was in the lowlands of Judah's tribal area ([Joshua 15:35](https://ref.ly/Josh15:35)). Joshua conquered it, along with 31 other Canaanite royal cities ([Joshua 12:15](https://ref.ly/Josh12:15)). King Rehoboam strengthened it along with 15 other cities ([2 Chronicles 11:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:7)). After the exiles' return from captivity in Babylon, people from Judah lived in Adullam again ([Nehemiah 11:30](https://ref.ly/Neh11:30)).

A cave near Adullam was important several times in David's life. He hid in it when he fled from King Saul ([1 Samuel 22:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:1)). He also used it as a base in his war against the Philistines ([2 Samuel 23:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:13-2Sam23:17)–[17](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:13-2Sam23:17); [1 Chronicles 11:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:15-1Chr11:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:15-1Chr11:19)). David wrote [Psalms 57](https://ref.ly/Ps57:1-Ps57:11) and [142](https://ref.ly/Ps142:1-Ps142:7) when he was in the cave of Adullam. Adullam is the modern\-day Tell esh\-Sheikh Madhkur.
