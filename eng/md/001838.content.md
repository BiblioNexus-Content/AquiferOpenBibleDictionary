## En-Rimmon (id: 5091)

EN\-RIMMON
==========

Town assigned first to Judah and then to Simeon ([Jos 15:32](https://ref.ly/Josh15:32); [19:7](https://ref.ly/Josh19:7); [1 Chr 4:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:32)). These verses refer to two places, Ain and Rimmon, but this was probably a scribal error for the one town, En\-rimmon (see [Jos 19:7](https://ref.ly/Josh19:7)). It was resettled after the exile ([Neh 11:29](https://ref.ly/Neh11:29)), and is perhaps the Rimmon south of Jerusalem mentioned in [Zechariah 14:10](https://ref.ly/Zech14:10). En\-rimmon is thought to be the modern Khirbet Umm er\-Rumamin, nine miles (14\.5 kilometers) north of Beersheba.
