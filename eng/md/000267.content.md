## Alpha and Omega (id: 3527)

ALPHA AND OMEGA
===============

A phrase used as a title in the New Testament for both God and Jesus Christ ([Revelation 1:8](https://ref.ly/Rev1:8); [21:6](https://ref.ly/Rev21:6); [22:13](https://ref.ly/Rev22:13)). Alpha (Α) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and Omega (Ω) is the last letter. The English equivalent is “the A and the Z.” Similar titles are “the beginning and the end” and “the first and the last” ([Revelation](https://ref.ly/Rev21:6) [1:17](https://ref.ly/Rev1:17); [2:8](https://ref.ly/Rev2:8); [21:6](https://ref.ly/Rev21:6); [22:13](https://ref.ly/Rev22:13)).

Similar statements can be found in the Old Testament in [Isaiah 41:4](https://ref.ly/Isa41:4); [44:6](https://ref.ly/Isa44:6); and [48:12](https://ref.ly/Isa48:12). They stress the unique and faithful sovereignty (supreme power and authority) of God and his Son, Jesus. They remind Christians that the creation of the universe and the end of all human history are both under the control of the living God. *See* God, Names of.
