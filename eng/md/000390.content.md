## Aphairema (id: 3652)

APHAIREMA
=========

One of the cities Demetrius Nicator (the Conqueror) took from Samaria and added to Judea ([1 Maccabees 11:34](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:34)). Demetrius was the king of Syria. The name Aphairema is thought by some scholars to be a corruption of Ephraim. Aphairema may be the modern et\-Taiyibeh.
