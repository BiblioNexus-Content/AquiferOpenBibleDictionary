## Gilo, Giloh, Gilonite (id: 5471)

GILO, GILOH, GILONITE
=====================

A village, and those living there, in the mountains of southern Judah ([Joshua 15:51](https://ref.ly/Josh15:51)). King David's counselor Ahithophel was a Gilonite ([2 Samuel 15:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:12); [23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)). Today, researchers believe Giloh may have been located at a place now called Khirbet Jala, which is just northeast of the city of Hebron.
