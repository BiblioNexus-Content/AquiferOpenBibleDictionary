## Right Hand (id: 8038)

RIGHT HAND
==========

In the Bible, the phrase "right hand" has two main meanings. First, it means the right side of a person's body. Second, it is often used as a symbol with special meaning.

The word "right" in the Bible often means "correct" or "good." When something is "right," it means it is just and follows God's ways ([Genesis 18:25](https://ref.ly/Gen18:25)). In many places in the Bible, God's right hand is used as a symbol of his power. For example:

* It represents how God helps his people win battles([Psalms 17:7, 98:1](https://ref.ly/Ps17:7,Ps17:98))
* It shows how God punishes those who do evil things ([Hebrews 2:16](https://ref.ly/Hab2:16))
* It shows how God punishes those who do evil things ([Psalms 139:10](https://ref.ly/Ps139:10)).

While humans cannot save themselves by their own power, God promises to make people strong when he decides to help them ([Job 40:14](https://ref.ly/Job40:14); [Isaiah 41:13](https://ref.ly/Isa41:13)).

To be at the right hand of God is to be in a place of great blessings ([Psalms 16:11](https://ref.ly/Ps16:11)). At the right hand of God, the Lord Jesus Christ now reigns in glory and intercedes for those he has redeemed ([Romans 8:34](https://ref.ly/Rom8:34)).

To offer the right hand of fellowship is to extend acceptance and grace ([Galatians 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gal2:9)). In Bible times, people would shake right hands to show they were making a serious promise or agreement. This practice of using the right hand to make promises was also used in biblical times and continues today ([2 Kings 10:15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:15)).

The left hand is sometimes linked to blessings ([Proverbs 3:16](https://ref.ly/Prov3:16)). However, it may also be linked to when someone betrays trust or does something wrong ([Ecclesiastes 10:2](https://ref.ly/Eccl10:2)).
