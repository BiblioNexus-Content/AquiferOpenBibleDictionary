DIBRI

Dibri was a man from the tribe of Dan. He was the father of a woman named Shelomith. Shelomith married a man from Egypt. Shelomith and the Egyptian man had a son together. This son committed a serious sin by speaking against God's name. As punishment, the son was stoned to death while the Israelites were in the wilderness ([Leviticus 24:10–11](https://ref.ly/Lev24:10-Lev24:11)).
