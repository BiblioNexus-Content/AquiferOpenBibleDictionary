## Naphtali (Person) (id: 7305)

NAPHTALI (Person)
=================

One of Jacob’s 12 sons ([Genesis 35:25](https://ref.ly/Gen35:25); [1 Chronicles 2:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:2)). He was the second of two sons borne to Jacob by Bilhah, Rachel’s maid. Overjoyed at giving Jacob another son, Rachel named the boy Naphtali, meaning "my wrestling." She named him Naphtali because of her conflict with Leah: "In my great struggles, I have wrestled with my sister and won" ([Genesis 30:8](https://ref.ly/Gen30:8)). Naphtali eventually moved his family with Jacob to Egypt ([Genesis 46:24](https://ref.ly/Gen46:24); [Exodus 1:4](https://ref.ly/Exod1:4)). He had four sons ([Numbers 26:50](https://ref.ly/Num26:50); [1 Chronicles 7:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:13)). His descendants became one of the 12 tribes of Israel ([Numbers 1:43](https://ref.ly/Num1:43)).
