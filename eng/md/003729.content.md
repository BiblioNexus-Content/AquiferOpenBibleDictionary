## Matthew (Person) (id: 6989)

MATTHEW (Person)
================

Matthew was a tax collector who became one of Jesus's twelve closest followers (called apostles). Many believe that Matthew wrote the book about Jesus's life that is called the Gospel of Matthew.

Who Was Matthew?
----------------

Matthew was the son of Alphaeus. Before following Jesus, Matthew worked as a tax collector and was also known by the name Levi ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14); [Luke 5:27](https://ref.ly/Luke5:27); compare [Matthew 9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9)). He is called Matthew in all four lists of Jesus's twelve apostles ([Matthew 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3); [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18); [Luke 6:15](https://ref.ly/Luke6:15); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). Outside of these lists, Matthew's name is used only in the story where Jesus calls him to be his disciple ([Matthew 9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9); [Mark 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:13-Mark2:14); [Luke 5:27](https://ref.ly/Luke5:27)). 

Some people think Matthew might have been the brother of James the Less, who also had a father named Alphaeus ([Matthew 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3)). However, this is probably not true because the Bible would have mentioned this connection. It does so with brothers Peter and Andrew, and with James and John (the sons of Zebedee).

Matthew's Work and Background
-----------------------------

Matthew worked as a tax collector in the city of Capernaum, which was ruled by King Herod Antipas. His job was to collect money from people who carried goods on the road between Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea. To do this job well, Matthew needed to be educated. He knew how to speak Greek and Aramaic (the local language). These language skills would later help him write the book about Jesus that we call the Gospel of Matthew.

As a tax collector, Matthew was probably wealthy. However, many Jewish people strongly disliked tax collectors because they worked for the Roman government. The Pharisees (an important Jewish religious group) often grouped tax collectors together with people they called sinners ([Matthew 11:19](https://ref.ly/Matt11:19); [Mark 2:16](https://ref.ly/Mark2:16); [Luke 7:34](https://ref.ly/Luke7:34); [15:1](https://ref.ly/Luke15:1)).

Jesus Calls Matthew to Follow Him
---------------------------------

Jesus called Matthew to be his disciple while Matthew was collecting taxes. Jesus passed by on the road and said to him, “Follow me” ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14)). Matthew left everything to follow Jesus ([Luke 5:28](https://ref.ly/Luke5:28)). Matthew gave Jesus a great party at his house. A large crowd of his fellow tax collectors and others were there to enjoy it. It was at this party that the Pharisees and their scribes complained. They asked, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” ([Luke 5:30](https://ref.ly/Luke5:30)).

It is not clear when Jesus called Matthew to follow him. His first six disciples were likely there on that day. The Pharisees complained to Christ’s disciples during Matthew’s feast. Unlike Jesus's first disciples, Matthew was not originally a follower of John the Baptist.
