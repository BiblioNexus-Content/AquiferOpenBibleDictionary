MENUHOTH\*
==========

People descended from Judah through Shobal, mentioned only in [1 Chronicles 2:52](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:52) (rendered Manahethites in neb, kjv; Manahathites in niv, nasb, nlt). The rsv transliterates the Hebrew word Menuhoth, which derives from the same root as “half of the Manahathites” in verse [54](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54).
