## Jeiel (id: 6299)

JEIEL
=====

1\. Chief in Reuben’s tribe ([1 Chr 5:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:7)).

2\. Benjamite who lived at Gibeon and an ancestor of Israel’s first king, Saul ([1 Chr 8:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:29); [9:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35)).

3\. One of David’s mighty men ([1 Chr 11:44](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:44)). He is perhaps identical with \#1 above.

4\. Levite gatekeeper in the sanctuary. He seems to have served as a musician also ([1 Chr 15:18, 21](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:18,1Chr15:21); [16:5b](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5)). The Jeiel of [1 Chronicles 16:5a](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5) is probably a different musician.
