## Potsherd Gate (id: 7791)

POTSHERD GATE
=============

Gate in the south section of the preexilic Jerusalem wall. It led to the valley of Hinnom and to the Potter’s Field. Potters could dispose of sherds there, hence its name. The kjv (relating the term to the Hebrew word for sun) renders it “east gate” ([Jer 19:2](https://ref.ly/Jer19:2)).
