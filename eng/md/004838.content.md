## Salcah, Salchah, Salecah (id: 8103)

SALCAH\*, SALCHAH\*, SALECAH
============================

City or district that formed the northeastern extremity of the Amorite kingdom of Og in Bashan, east of the Jordan River. Salecah (variously spelled Salcah and Salchah in the kjv) was located near the city of Edrei ([Jos 12:5](https://ref.ly/Josh12:5)). The Israelites gained possession of this city when they defeated Og ([Dt 3:10](https://ref.ly/Deut3:10)). Later, Salecah was included in the land received by Gad’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 13:11](https://ref.ly/Josh13:11); [1 Chr 5:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:11)). The city is identifiable with the modern town of Salkhad.
