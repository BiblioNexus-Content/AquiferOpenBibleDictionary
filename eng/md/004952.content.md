## Sela-Hammahlekoth (id: 8213)

SELA\-HAMMAHLEKOTH\*
====================

Cliff in the wilderness of Maon, meaning “the Rock of Escape.” Saul, in his desire to kill David, attempted to catch him in the steep\-ravined mountains of Judah, where David had fled. Saul’s attentions were diverted by a Philistine raid, thus enabling David to escape ([1 Sm 23:28](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:28), nlt mg). The wadi el\-Malaqi, about eight miles (12\.9 kilometers) northeast of Maon, is a suggested location for this cliff.
