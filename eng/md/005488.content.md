## Taskmaster (id: 8749)

TASKMASTER
==========

A taskmaster was a person who supervised workers and forced them to work hard. Egyptian stone carvings show taskmasters holding whips, which they used to punish workers who did not work fast enough ([Exodus 1:11](https://ref.ly/Exod1:11); [3:7](https://ref.ly/Exod3:7); [5:6–14](https://ref.ly/Exod5:6-Exod5:14); [Job 3:18](https://ref.ly/Job3:18)). The Hebrew word used for taskmaster in the Bible means "to oppress," showing how badly they treated their workers. Kings David and Solomon had taskmasters. A man named Adoram was in charge of forced labor during their time ([2 Samuel 20:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:24); [1 Kings 4:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:6); [12:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:18); [2 Chronicles 10:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:18)). The cruel treatment by these taskmasters became one of the reasons why the northern tribes of Israel separated from the southern tribes after Solomon died ([1 Kings 12:3–14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:3-1Kgs12:14)).
