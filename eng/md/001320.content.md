## Citron Tree (id: 716005)

Citron Tree
===========

A tree native to Asia that produces fruit similar to lemons with a thick, fragrant rind. The citron tree (*Tetraclinis articulata*) usually grows no taller than 9\.1 meters (30 feet). It has hard, dark\-colored, long\-lasting, fragrant wood that can be polished to a fine finish.

This wood was one of the most valuable woods in ancient times. People used it extensively for making fine furniture and cabinets. It was commonly said to be worth its weight in gold. Because of its natural resin content, the wood resists decay and remains mostly undamaged by insects.
