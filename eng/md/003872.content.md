## Miktam (id: 7131)

MIKTAM\*
========

Title in [Psalms 16](https://ref.ly/Ps16:1-Ps16:11) and [56–60](https://ref.ly/Ps56:1-Ps60:12) (see niv), possibly also of Hezekiah’s recovery psalm, [Isaiah 38:9](https://ref.ly/Isa38:9). The precise meaning of the term is uncertain. Its similarity to the Akkadian word “to cover, expiate” suggests the title may mean a psalm of expiation or sin covered. Other suggestions include a psalm of problems or mysteries.
