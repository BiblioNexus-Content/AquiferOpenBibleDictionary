WINEPRESS
=========

A sunken area ([Judges 6:11](https://ref.ly/Judg6:11)) where the grape harvest was thrown and trodden with bare feet, amid shouts of joy and vintage work songs ([Jeremiah 48:33](https://ref.ly/Jer48:33); compare [Isaiah 65:8](https://ref.ly/Isa65:8)). The red juice flowed through spouts into jars. Full winepresses meant prosperity; deserted ones spoke of destitution. The common winepress was a natural landmark ([Judges 7:25](https://ref.ly/Judg7:25); [Zechariah 14:10](https://ref.ly/Zech14:10)). A privately owned one showed the vineyard owner's care ([Isaiah 5:2](https://ref.ly/Isa5:2); [Matthew 21:33](https://ref.ly/Matt21:33)).

Grape treading symbolized the ruthless trampling by invading armies ([Lamentations 1:15](https://ref.ly/Lam1:15)). This vivid battle metaphor mixes with divine judgment ([Isaiah 63:1](https://ref.ly/Isa63:1-Isa63:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa63:1-Isa63:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Isa63:1-Isa63:6)). It anticipates the Lord's final judgment, called “the great winepress of God’s wrath” ([Revelation 14:18](https://ref.ly/Rev14:18-Rev14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Rev14:18-Rev14:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Rev14:18-Rev14:20)).
