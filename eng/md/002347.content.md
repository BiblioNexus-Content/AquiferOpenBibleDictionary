HAKKOZ
======

Name borne by a priestly family during the monarchy ([1 Chr 24:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:10)). In Ezra’s time, the family pedigree could not be documented properly; consequently, the privilege of priestly service was withdrawn ([Ezr 2:61](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:61); [Neh 3:4, 21](https://ref.ly/Neh3:4,Neh3:21); [7:63](https://ref.ly/Neh7:63); kjv “Koz”).
