## Abishag (id: 3309)

ABISHAG
=======

A beautiful young woman from Shunem who was sent to care for King David during his last days ([1 Kings 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:4)–[4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:1-1Kgs1:4)). After David’s death, Adonijah asked his half\-brother, King Solomon, to marry Abishag. At that time, to take the concubine of a deceased king was to claim you were the next king (a concubine is a woman who lived with a man and had a relationship like a wife but without the full rights of marriage). Adonijah's request made Solomon angry and he ordered Adonijah to be killed ([1 Kings 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25)–[25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:13-1Kgs2:25)).
