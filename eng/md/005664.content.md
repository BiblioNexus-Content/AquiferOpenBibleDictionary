## Transjordan (id: 8914)

TRANSJORDAN\*
=============

Territory on the east side of the Jordan River. Although this name does not appear in the Bible, numerous events took place there in biblical history. Today the area is roughly equivalent to the kingdom of Jordan. In biblical times the area would have comprised Bashan, Gilead, Ammon, Moab, Edom, and the desert regions farther east. In the OT the expression “beyond the Jordan” is often used for the area ([Gn 50:10–11](https://ref.ly/Gen50:10-Gen50:11); [Dt 3:20](https://ref.ly/Deut3:20); [4:47](https://ref.ly/Deut4:47); [Jos 9:10](https://ref.ly/Josh9:10); [13:8](https://ref.ly/Josh13:8); [18:7](https://ref.ly/Josh18:7); [Jgs 5:17](https://ref.ly/Judg5:17)), although the same expression is used occasionally for the area west of Jordan ([Dt 3:25](https://ref.ly/Deut3:25)). In NT times, this area was known as Perea. *See* Perea.
