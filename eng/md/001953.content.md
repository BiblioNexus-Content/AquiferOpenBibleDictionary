## Ezbai (id: 5212)

EZBAI
=====

The father of Naarai. Naarai was one of King David's special warriors called "the thirty" ([1 Chronicles 11:37](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:37)). [2 Samuel 23:35](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:35) calls him Paarai the Arbite. Some interpreters suggest that "the son of Ezbai" in the 1 Chronicles passage is a corruption of "the Arbite." The correct reading of his name should be "Naarai the Arbite."
