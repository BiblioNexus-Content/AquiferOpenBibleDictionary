## Asahel (id: 3776)

ASAHEL
======

1. A warrior among David’s mighty men known as "the thirty" ([2 Samuel 23:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:24); [1 Chronicles 11:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:26)). Asahel was the son of David’s half\-sister Zeruiah and the brother of Joab and Abishai ([2 Samuel 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18); [1 Chronicles 2:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:16)). In the battle of Gibeon, David’s general Joab engaged the forces of Abner, leader of Ishbosheth’s army. Asahel, who "could run like a deer," pursued Abner. In the encounter that happened after that, Abner killed Asahel ([2 Samuel 2:18–23, 32](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18-2Sam2:23,2Sam2:32)).
2. One of the Levites sent out by King Jehoshaphat of Judah to teach the people the law of the Lord ([2 Chronicles 17:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:8)).
3. A temple aide appointed by King Hezekiah to take care of the tithed offerings given to support the Levites ([2 Chronicles 31:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:13)).
4. The father of Jonathan. Jonathan (not Saul’s son) opposed appointing a commission to take action about the foreign (pagan) wives of some of the Jews after the Babylonian exile ([Ezra 10:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:15)).
