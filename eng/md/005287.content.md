## So (id: 8591)

SO
==

A king of Egypt, mentioned once in Scripture ([2 Kgs 17:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:4)), with whom Hoshea, king of Israel, sought an alliance. This rebellious move, in part, prompted Shalmaneser V of Assyria to imprison Hoshea ([2 Kgs 17:3–5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:3-2Kgs17:5)). It is difficult to identify So with any of the rulers of Egypt who are named in extrabiblical sources.
