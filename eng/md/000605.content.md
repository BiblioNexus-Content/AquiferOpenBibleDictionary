ATTHARATES
==========

A Persian word meaning “governor” ([Nehemiah 8:9](https://ref.ly/Neh8:9)). “Attharates” is a different spelling of the title Tirshatha. In the Apocrypha, it is written as a proper name ([1 Esdras 9:49](https://ref.ly/1Esd9:49)). (The Apocrypha is a set of ancient texts not included in the Hebrew Bible but accepted by some Christian groups.)
