## Judge (id: 6492)

JUDGE
=====

An official with authority to decide matters brought before a court. 

The judge had many tasks. Most tasks were legal but some were political. In the period of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the elders of the tribes decided arguments. Moses appointed other judges to assist him but took the difficult cases for himself ([Exodus 18:13–26](https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:26); [Deuteronomy 1:9–17](https://ref.ly/Deut1:9-Deut1:17)). Samuel traveled to different places to judge cases ([1 Samuel 7:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:16-1Sam7:17)). His sons also became judges ([8:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:1)). When kings ruled Israel, judges were official leaders with clear roles and duties.

In the New Testament period, there were two types of courts in Palestine: Jewish courts and Roman courts. Cases that could lead to death were heard by Roman judges. People had to bring witnesses to court trials ([Matthew 18:16](https://ref.ly/Matt18:16); [2 Corinthians 13:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:1); [1 Timothy 5:19](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:19)). Jesus was put on trial before Pontius Pilate, who was the Roman governor ([Matthew 27:11–25](https://ref.ly/Matt27:11-Matt27:25); [Mark 15:2–5](https://ref.ly/Mark15:2-Mark15:5); [Luke 23:2–3](https://ref.ly/Luke23:2-Luke23:3); [John 18:29–40](https://ref.ly/John18:29-John18:40)). Paul was also put on trial before two Roman governors: Felix and Festus ( ([Acts 24:1–26](https://ref.ly/Acts24:1-Acts24:26); [25:1–26](https://ref.ly/Acts25:1-Acts25:26)).
