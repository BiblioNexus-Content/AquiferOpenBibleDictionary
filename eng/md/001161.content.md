## Caphar-salama (id: 4417)

CAPHAR\-SALAMA
==============

A village where Judas Maccabeus fought the Syrian commander Nicanor ([1 Maccabees 7:31](https://ref.ly/1Macc7:31)). After about 500 of the men of Nicanor died, the fugitives took refuge in the “city of David.” This means Caphar\-salama must have been near Jerusalem.

* **Associated Passages:** 1MA 7:31
