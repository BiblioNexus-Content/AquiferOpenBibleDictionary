## Capernaum (id: 4415)

CAPERNAUM
=========

Capernaum was a city in Galilee where Jesus based his work and taught regularly. This city is only mentioned in the Gospels. It was on the northwest side of the Sea of Galilee (also called Lake of Gennesaret). Capernaum means “village of Nahum.” The name might refer to Nahum, who wrote a book in the Old Testament, or it could be named after a different person called Nahum.

Where Was Capernaum Located?
----------------------------

The Gospel of Matthew says Capernaum was located near the Sea of Galilee, in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali ([Matthew 4:13](https://ref.ly/Matt4:13)). The west shore of the lake was where the tribe of Naphtali lived. 

Two stories about people in Capernaum show it was near the border of the Jordan River and the political border. The story of the centurion suggests there was a small group of about 100 soldiers in this border town ([Matthew 8:5](https://ref.ly/Matt8:5); [Luke 7:2](https://ref.ly/Luke7:2)). In another story, Jesus asks Levi to leave his job collecting taxes. It also shows the town was on a border ([Matthew 9:9](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9); [Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14); [Luke 5:27](https://ref.ly/Luke5:27)).

Ancient Jewish writings tell us that Capernaum was located at a place called Tell Hum. We know Capernaum existed in the year AD 110 because it was referred to in Midrash Kohelet 1\.8 and 7\.26 as "Kaphar nahum.” This shows that Capernaum still existed in the second century. 

Capernaum is not mentioned again until 1160, when Benjamin of Tudela talks about “Capharnaum which is Kaphar Nahum.” The Franciscans (a religious order of priests) now own the site. They have found many coins from the time at Tell Hum. They also found ruins of a Jewish place of worship (called a synagogue) that was probably built around AD 300\. 

Recent digging at Tell Hum has proven this was definitely where ancient Capernaum stood. Archaeologists found an old house under a building that Jewish Christians used for meetings in the fourth century. This house had been used as a meeting place for early Christians since around the first half of the second century. Based on ancient writings and markings found on stones, many scholars think this was Peter's house.

Capernaum in the New Testament
------------------------------

Capernaum was an important city where Roman soldiers were stationed. After the people of Nazareth rejected Jesus, he came to live in Capernaum ([Matthew 9:1](https://ref.ly/Matt9:1)). Capernaum was his home and Jesus did many miracles ([Mark 2:1](https://ref.ly/Mark2:1); [1:34](https://ref.ly/Mark1:34)). 

* He healed the centurion’s servant ([Matthew 8:5](https://ref.ly/Matt8:5)).
* He healed Peter’s mother\-in\-law ([Mark 1:31](https://ref.ly/Mark1:31)).
* He healed a man with an unclean spirit ([Mark 1:23](https://ref.ly/Mark1:23); [Luke 4:33](https://ref.ly/Luke4:33)).

Even though Jesus did a lot of good things in Capernaum, he said bad things would happen to the city because the people did not change their ways: “And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades” ([Matthew 11:23](https://ref.ly/Matt11:23)).
