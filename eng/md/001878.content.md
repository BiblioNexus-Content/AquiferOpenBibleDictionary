## Eran (id: 5132)

ERAN
====

Eran was a grandson of Ephraim and the oldest son of Shuthelah ([Numbers 26:36](https://ref.ly/Num26:36)). The Eranite family came from Eran. In [1 Chronicles 7:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:20), the name Eran does not appear. Instead, the name Eleadah is used in a similar family list. This difference might be because someone made a copying mistake when writing down these records.
