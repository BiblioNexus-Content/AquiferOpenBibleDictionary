## Ashteroth-Karnaim (id: 3810)

ASHTEROTH\-KARNAIM
==================

A city where an alliance of four kings led by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, defeated the giants of Rephaim ([Genesis 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5); compare [Deuteronomy 3:11](https://ref.ly/Deut3:11)). The area was given to Abraham and his descendants by the Lord ([Genesis 15:18](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:20)). It is probably the same as Ashtaroth. 

*See* Ashtaroth, Ashterathite.
