## Pine Tree (id: 7740)

PINE TREE
=========

A pine tree is an evergreen tree with needle\-shaped leaves in clusters and seed\-bearing cones. While there is some confusion about which exact conifer trees the Bible mentions, pines are likely referred to in several passages such as [Leviticus 23:40](https://ref.ly/Lev23:40); [Nehemiah 8:15](https://ref.ly/Neh8:15); [Isaiah 41:19](https://ref.ly/Isa41:19); and [60:13](https://ref.ly/Isa60:13).

One of the pine trees found in Israel and the surrounding areas is the Brutian pine *(Pinus brutia)*. This tree grows in the mountain regions of northern Palestine. It can grow from 3 to 10\.7 meters (10 to 35 feet) tall with spread\-out growth and branches that circle around the trunk in rings.

Another type is the Aleppo pine *(Pinus halepensis)*. In the Berean Standard Bible, the Hebrew words sometimes translated as "fir" in older versions are more accurately translated as "cypress" or "pine." These trees may refer to the Aleppo pine or a similar species, such as the cypress ([2 Samuel 6:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5); [1 Kings 5:8, 10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:8,1Kgs5:10); [6:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:34); [2 Kings 19:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:23); [2 Chronicles 2:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8); [Psalms 104:17](https://ref.ly/Ps104:17); [Song of Songs 1:17](https://ref.ly/Song1:17); [Isaiah 14:8](https://ref.ly/Isa14:8); [37:24](https://ref.ly/Isa37:24); [55:13](https://ref.ly/Isa55:13); [60:13](https://ref.ly/Isa60:13); [Ezekiel 27:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:5); [31:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek31:8); [Hosea 14:8](https://ref.ly/Hos14:8); [Nahum 2:3](https://ref.ly/Nah2:3); [Zechariah 11:2](https://ref.ly/Zech11:2)). The Aleppo pine grows from 2\.7 to 18\.3 meters tall (9 to 60 feet) with upward\-spreading branches and yellowish or brownish smaller branches.
