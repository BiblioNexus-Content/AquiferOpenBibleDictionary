## Jahaz (id: 6176)

JAHAZ
=====

Town east of the Dead Sea (in modern Jordan) where the Israelites defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, when he refused to permit them to pass through his land ([Nm 21:23](https://ref.ly/Num21:23); [Dt 2:32](https://ref.ly/Deut2:32); [Jgs 11:20](https://ref.ly/Judg11:20)). According to [Joshua 13:18](https://ref.ly/Josh13:18), Moses gave the town to Reuben’s tribe as part of its allotment. The town with its surrounding pasturelands was given to the Merarite Levites ([Jos 21:36](https://ref.ly/Josh21:36); [1 Chr 6:78](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:78)).

In later times, in prophetic oracles by both Isaiah ([Is 15:4](https://ref.ly/Isa15:4)) and Jeremiah ([Jer 48:21](https://ref.ly/Jer48:21)), it is referred to as a city in the land of Moab. This may indicate that it was taken from Israel by Moab (to whom it apparently belonged before Sihon conquered it). The town is mentioned on the Moabite Stone (known as the Dibon Stele and dating to c. 845 BC) as the place where Mesha, king of Moab, had lived while at war with Israel. According to Mesha, he took Jahaz from Israel and added it to his own territory.
