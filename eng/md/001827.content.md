## En-Gannim (id: 5081)

EN\-GANNIM
==========

1\. Village in the lowland of Judah near Beth\-shemesh ([Jos 15:34](https://ref.ly/Josh15:34)). Some identify it with the modern Beit Jemal, but this is doubtful.

2\. Town on the boundary of Issachar ([Jos 19:21](https://ref.ly/Josh19:21)). It was a Levitical city of the Gershonites ([21:29](https://ref.ly/Josh21:29)) and the Anem of [1 Chronicles 6:73](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:73), which may be a copyist’s mistake. It seems to be the Ginaea of Josephus (*Antiquities* 20\.6\.1\). Its site is the modern Jenin, a village on the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, five miles (8\.1 kilometers) northeast of Dothan and about 68 miles (109\.4 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.
