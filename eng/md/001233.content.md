## Charmis (id: 4486)

CHARMIS
=======

Charmis was the son of Melchiel. He was one of three civil officers (magistrates) of Bethulia ([Judith 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Jdt6:14-Jdt6:15); [10:6](https://ref.ly/Jdt10:6)). When the Assyrians attacked, Charmis and the other leaders said they would wait only a short time for God to rescue them. If nothing happened, they planned to surrender.

Judith strongly rebuked them. She told them not to limit God or decide how and when He would act ([8:9–27](https://ref.ly/Jdt8:9-Jdt8:27)).
