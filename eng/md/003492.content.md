## Lightning (id: 6747)

LIGHTNING
=========

The flashing of light. Lightning in the Bible often shows God's presence. It appears at important moments, such as:

* When God comes to Mount Sinai to give Moses the Ten Commandments ([Exodus 19:16](https://ref.ly/Exod19:16))
* When describing Jesus's return ([Matthew 24:27](https://ref.ly/Matt24:27))
* In visions of God ([Ezekiel 1:14](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:14); [Daniel 10:6](https://ref.ly/Dan10:6))

The book of Revelation often uses lightning as a symbol. This book mainly aims to give a vision of God ([Revelation 4:5](https://ref.ly/Rev4:5); [8:5](https://ref.ly/Rev8:5); [16:18](https://ref.ly/Rev16:18)).

Lightning can represent different aspects of God:

1. God's judgment against enemies ([2 Samuel 22:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:15); [Revelation 16:18](https://ref.ly/Rev16:18))
2. God's power and rule over all creation ([Psalm 135:7](https://ref.ly/Ps135:7))

In the book of Job, God mentions lightning to show Job how great creation is. This helps Job understand how small he is compared to God and creation ([Job 38:35](https://ref.ly/Job38:35); compare [Psalm 77:16–18](https://ref.ly/Ps77:16-Ps77:18)).
