## Boaz (Person) (id: 4283)

BOAZ (Person)
=============

Salmon’s son from the tribe of Judah ([Ruth 4:18](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:18-Ruth4:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:18-Ruth4:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:18-Ruth4:22)). Boaz lived in Bethlehem in the days of the judges and married Ruth, a Moabite woman. Boaz was an ancestor of Christ ([Matthew 1:5](https://ref.ly/Matt1:5); [Luke 3:32](https://ref.ly/Luke3:32)) and a wealthy relative by marriage of Ruth’s mother\-in\-law, Naomi. Boaz noticed Ruth when she was picking up food from one of his fields ([Ruth 2](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:1-Ruth2:23)). Boaz's kindness to Ruth made Naomi think he might agree to buy her late husband's land and marry Ruth as part of the deal.
