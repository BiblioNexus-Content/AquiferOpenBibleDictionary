## Asaiah (id: 3778)

ASAIAH
======

1. A royal servant King Josiah of Judah sent to ask the prophetess Huldah about the meaning of the book of the law found in the renovation of the temple ([2 Kings 22:12, 14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:12,2Kgs22:14); [2 Chronicles 34:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:20)).
2. The clan leader of Simeon’s tribe who settled in Gedor (possibly also known as Gerar) during Hezekiah’s reign ([1 Chronicles 4:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:36)).
3. A Levitical leader in the time of King David. Asaiah helped bring the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 6:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:30); [15:6, 11](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:6,1Chr15:11)).
4. Shiloni’s oldest son. Asaiah’s family was among the first to resettle in Jerusalem after the exile ([1 Chronicles 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:5)). Perhaps the same as Maaseiah of [Nehemiah 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5). *See* Maaseiah \#14.
