## Gouging (id: 5518)

GOUGING
=======

Gouging was the painful practice of forcibly removing a person's eyes. This was commonly done by the Philistines, Amorites, Babylonians, and other nations that surrounded Israel ([Judges 16:21](https://ref.ly/Judg16:21); [2 Kings 25:7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:7)). People would gouge out eyes not only to disable their enemies or prisoners but also to bring extreme shame and disgrace upon them ([1 Samuel 11:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam11:2)). 

The Israelites seem to have known about gouging from their time in Egypt ([Numbers 16:14](https://ref.ly/Num16:14)). But there is no evidence that it was a common practice in Israel.
