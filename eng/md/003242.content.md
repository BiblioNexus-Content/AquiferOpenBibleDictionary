## Junia (id: 6500)

JUNIA
=====

A Jew who, along with Andronicus, was greeted by Paul in his letter to the church in Rome. This is according to the text in some manuscripts ([Romans 16:7](https://ref.ly/Rom16:7)). Paul recognized Junia as an apostle who had been a prisoner with Paul for the sake of the gospel. Scholars are not certain whether Junia was a woman or a man.
