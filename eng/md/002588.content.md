## Hiel (id: 5842)

HIEL
====

Bethelite in the days of King Ahab who fulfilled Joshua’s curse upon the city of Jericho ([Jos 6:26](https://ref.ly/Josh6:26); [1 Kgs 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:34)). Joshua had said centuries before that anyone attempting to rebuild the city would suffer the loss of his oldest and youngest sons. It is unclear whether Hiel’s sons died a natural death or were killed in a punitive ritual.
