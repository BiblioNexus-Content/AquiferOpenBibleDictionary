## Beriah (id: 4133)

BERIAH
======

1. Asher’s son, who moved to Egypt with his family, relatives, and grandfather Jacob ([Genesis 46:17](https://ref.ly/Gen46:17); [1 Chronicles 7:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:30)). His descendants were called Beriites ([Numbers 26:44](https://ref.ly/Num26:44)).
2. Ephraim’s youngest son, born after several of his brothers were killed at Gath for stealing cattle ([1 Chronicles 7:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:20-1Chr7:23)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:20-1Chr7:23)[23](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:20-1Chr7:23)).
3. Elpaal’s son, head of a family in the tribe of Benjamin. This Beriah lived at Aijalon and helped kick out invaders from Gath ([1 Chronicles 8:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:13)).
4. Shimei’s son, a Levite of the clan of Gershon who served in the temple at Jerusalem. Because neither Beriah nor his brother Jeush had many sons, their families were counted as a single subclan within the Levites ([1 Chronicles 23:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:10-1Chr23:11)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:10-1Chr23:11)[11](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:10-1Chr23:11)).
