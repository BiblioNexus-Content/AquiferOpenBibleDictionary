## Nicanor (id: 7394)

NICANOR
=======

1. The son of Patroclus, “one of the king’s chief friends” ([2 Maccabees 8:9](https://ref.ly/2Macc8:9)). He was a Syrian general who served under two kings: Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Demetrius Soter. Nicanor may have been the supreme commander over Ptolemy and Gorgias in Lysias's first campaign against Judas Maccabeus ([1 Maccabees 3:38ff](https://ref.ly/1Macc3:38-1Macc3:59).) This was during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.

    Nicanor died in the battle at Adasa and Beth\-horon in 161 BC. According to 2 Maccabees, Judas hung the head of Nicanor from the citadel (a fortress in Jerusalem) as a clear proof of the God's victory ([15:35](https://ref.ly/2Macc15:35)).

2. One of the seven men chosen by the early church to manage the daily distribution of food to the poor believers in Jerusalem ([Acts 6:5](https://ref.ly/Acts6:5)). These seven men were selected to ensure that widows and others in need received fair treatment in the daily distribution of food.
