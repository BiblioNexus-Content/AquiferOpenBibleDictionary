## Smith (id: 8546)

SMITH
=====

Worker in metals; a blacksmith. The earliest metalworker mentioned in the Bible is Tubal\-cain ([Gn 4:22](https://ref.ly/Gen4:22)). The term covers metalworkers of all kinds: copper, bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Silversmiths are mentioned in [Judges 17:4](https://ref.ly/Judg17:4) and [Acts 19:24](https://ref.ly/Acts19:24). Ironsmiths were rare or even nonexistent in Israel up to the time of Samuel, and the Israelites had to go to the Philistine smiths to have their iron tools sharpened ([1 Sm 13:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:19)). In the days of the kings, Israelite smiths were active and were subsequently taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar ([2 Kgs 24:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:14-2Kgs24:16); [Jer 24:1](https://ref.ly/Jer24:1); [29:2](https://ref.ly/Jer29:2)). Details of the work of the smith are given in several accounts ([Prv 25:4](https://ref.ly/Prov25:4); [Is 44:12](https://ref.ly/Isa44:12); [54:16](https://ref.ly/Isa54:16)). The smiths mentioned in [Zechariah 1:20](https://ref.ly/Zech1:20) are probably ironsmiths or blacksmiths.
