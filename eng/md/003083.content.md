## Jeshimon (id: 6340)

JESHIMON
========

1. An extremely dry, empty wilderness at the end of the Dead Sea, not far from Pisgah and Peor ([Numbers 21:20](https://ref.ly/Num21:20); [23:28](https://ref.ly/Num23:28)). In these Bible passages, the Berean Standard Bible renders the word as “wasteland” in the main text. But it has “Jeshimon” in the margin notes. This allows readers to understand it as either a general description or as a specific named area. The Revised Standard Version uses “desert.”
2. A wilderness to the north of the hill of Hakilah and of Maon ([1 Samuel 23:19, 24](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:19,1Sam23:24); [26:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:1-1Sam26:3)). This location was probably just a few miles south of the city of Hebron.
