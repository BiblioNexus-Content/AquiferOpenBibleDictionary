## Ascension of Christ (id: 3785)

ASCENSION OF CHRIST
===================

The ascension is the event when Jesus ascended (went up to) heaven after his resurrection from the dead.

What Does the Bible Say About the Ascension of Christ?
------------------------------------------------------

Among the New Testament writers, only Luke described Jesus’s ascension. [Acts 1:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11) describes a scene in which Jesus was “taken up” and disappeared into a cloud. [Luke 24:50–51](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:51) and [Acts 1:12](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12) locate that final event near Bethany. Bethany is east of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives.

Matthew ended his history before the day of Pentecost. John did not describe the ascension directly, but he included Jesus's own words about it. Jesus said he would leave but return later ([John 21:22](https://ref.ly/John21:22)). He cannot be touched, for he must ascend ([20:17](https://ref.ly/John20:17)). Many will believe without having seen him ([20:29](https://ref.ly/John20:29)). 

The Gospels tell us three main things:

1. After rising from death, Jesus appeared to his disciples.
2. At some point in time, those appearances stopped.
3. Though Jesus is not physically present, he is spiritually present with his church.

Other New Testament writings agree with this. The apostle Paul wrote that God raised Christ from the dead “and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms” ([Ephesians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20)). The writer of Hebrews said, “He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high” ([Hebrews 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3)).

Why Does the Ascension Matter?
------------------------------

The ascension is important for two reasons: what it means for Christ and what it means for Christians.

### What Does the Ascension Mean for Christ?

For Christ, the ascension is the necessary entrance into his heavenly “glorification.” In his glorification, he sits on the right hand of the Father until his enemies are completely defeated. [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1) uses symbolic language to describe this: "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet." (This Psalm is the most quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament.) The ascension is proof of his glorification and his superiority over such Old Testament heroes as David ([Acts 2:33–36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33-Acts2:36)). 

By his ascension, Christ rises over all and fills all ([Ephesians 4:10](https://ref.ly/Eph4:10)). In his ascension, he receives “the name that is over every name” ([Philemon 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)). For the author of the book of Hebrews, the ascension is also proof of Christ’s superiority to angels. He sits enthroned while they are constantly being sent out to serve ([Hebrews 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13-Heb1:14)). Angels, authorities, and powers are all subject to the ascended Christ ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16); [1 Peter 3:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22)).

### What Does the Ascension Mean For Christians?

For the Christian, the ascension of Christ is meaningful in four ways:

1. Without it there would be no gift of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit could not come until Jesus had ascended and sent him ([John 16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7)). Without the ascension, the church would have Jesus locally in one place, not spiritually present “where two or three gather together” ([Matthew 18:20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:20); compare [28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)).
2. Since a truly human Jesus has ascended to heaven, human beings can also ascend there. Jesus went “to prepare a place” for his followers ([John 14:2](https://ref.ly/John14:2)). The hope of those who are “in Christ” is that they will eventually ascend to be with him ([2 Corinthians 5:1–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:10)).
3. The ascension proves that the sacrifice of Christ is finished and accepted by God. Jesus has passed through the heavens ([Hebrews 4:14](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14)). He entered the presence of God ([6:20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:20)). This presence is described as the most holy place of the heavenly temple. It is the real temple of which the one on earth was a copy ([9:24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24)). Christ brought a single, final sacrifice to God that never needs to be repeated ([9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12)). Then Christ sat down, showing that no repetition of his sacrifice is necessary ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3); [10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12); [12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2)).
4. The ascension means that there is a human being in heaven who sympathizes with humanity and can therefore speak on behalf of humanity ([1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)). Jesus has experienced everything humans experience. He experienced birth, growth, temptation, suffering, and death. Jesus can serve effectively as a mediator before God in heaven ([Hebrews 2:17](https://ref.ly/Heb2:17); [5:7–10](https://ref.ly/Heb5:7-Heb5:10)). Christ’s ascension assures the church that God understands what it is like to be human, and that Christians can approach him boldly in their prayers ([4:14–16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)).

The ascension of Christ is a vital part of New Testament teaching. It shows Christ's high position and gives Christians confidence and hope.
