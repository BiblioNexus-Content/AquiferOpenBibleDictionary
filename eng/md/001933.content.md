## Eve (id: 5194)

EVE
===

The first woman, who was called the “the mother of all living” ([Genesis 3:20](https://ref.ly/Gen3:20)). The book of Genesis tells us that after God created Adam, he saw that Adam should not be alone. God decided to create “a suitable helper” for Adam ([2:18](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18)). The Hebrew word for helper is *ezer*, which is also used in other parts of the Old Testament to describe how God helps Israel. God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and used it to create Eve (verses [21–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:21-Gen2:25)).

Her Name
--------

Adam gave his wife Eve two names. First, he called her “woman." This name showed her connection to man ([Genesis 2:23](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23)). Later, after they disobeyed God, he named her Eve, which means "life." It refers to her role as the first mother of the human race ([3:20](https://ref.ly/Gen3:20)).

Her Story
---------

Adam and Eve first lived in the garden of Eden. They obeyed God by serving him and caring for one another. Then evil entered the world. The serpent tempted Eve to disobey what God commanded. God had told them not to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ([Genesis 2:17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:17); [3:3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:3)). The serpent tricked Eve with clever words, and she ate the fruit. She then gave some fruit to Adam, who also ate it even though he was not tricked like Eve was. After eating the fruit, they realized they were naked and made clothes from fig leaves.

When God came to talk with them, they hid from him. When God asked what happened, Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent. God told Eve that because of their disobedience, giving birth would be painful. He also said that her husband would rule over her ([Genesis 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16)). Later, Eve became the mother of Cain, Abel, Seth, and other children ([4:1–2, 25](https://ref.ly/Gen4:1-Gen4:2,Gen4:25); [5:4](https://ref.ly/Gen5:4)).

Her Future
----------

The New Testament mentions Eve twice. The apostle Paul refers to Eve when discussing whether women should teach in the church. He writes, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man" ([1 Timothy 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:12)). The Greek word for "man" is the same word for "husband," so some scholars argue that Paul may be referring specifically to a woman’s relationship with her husband rather than to all men in general. Paul’s reasoning is that man was created first, and the woman was deceived and became the first to sin ([1 Timothy 2:12–15;](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:12-1Tim2:15) [2 Corinthians 11:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:3)). 

Some interpret this as Paul emphasizing the creation order and the fall (when Adam and Eve first sinned) as reasons for limiting women's authority in the church. Others argue that Paul’s instructions were specific to the church in Ephesus at that time, where false teaching was a problem. They understand Paul's words as addressing a particular situation rather than establishing a universal rule that forbids all women in all churches from teaching.
