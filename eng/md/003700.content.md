## Martha (id: 6959)

MARTHA
======

The sister of Mary and Lazarus and a friend of Jesus. Martha’s family lived in Bethany, a small town on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives.

Luke tells about a time when Martha was busy preparing and serving food while her sister Mary sat listening to Jesus teach. Martha came to Jesus and complained that Mary was not helping her. Jesus responded gently: "You are worried and upset about many things. But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her" ([Luke 10:41](https://ref.ly/Luke10:41-Luke10:42)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke10:41-Luke10:42)[42](https://ref.ly/Luke10:41-Luke10:42)). In saying this, Jesus challenged Martha’s worry, showing her that spending time with him is the most important and rewarding priority.

John tells the story of when Lazarus died. When Jesus arrived in Bethany, Martha went out to meet him while Mary stayed at home ([John 11:20](https://ref.ly/John11:20)). Once again, Martha complained to Jesus, saying, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" ([John 11:21](https://ref.ly/John11:21)). Martha thought Jesus meant Lazarus would come back to life at the final resurrection (when all people will rise from death at the end of time). But Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies" ([John 11:23](https://ref.ly/John11:23-John11:26)[–](https://ref.ly/John11:23-John11:26)[26](https://ref.ly/John11:23-John11:26)). 

Martha then said she believed Jesus was God's chosen one (the Christ, [John 11:27](https://ref.ly/John11:27)). Later, Jesus asked people to open Lazarus's tomb. Martha worried about this because Lazarus had been dead for four days. Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” ([John 11:40](https://ref.ly/John11:40)). Then Jesus brought Lazarus back to life.

[John 12:1](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11)[–](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11)[11](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:11) tells about another meal where Martha served Jesus and Lazarus. This time, Martha continued serving while Mary showed her love for Jesus, and Martha did not complain.
