## Sorek, Valley of (id: 8582)

SOREK, Valley of
================

Valley in which Delilah lived ([Jgs 16:4](https://ref.ly/Judg16:4)). It began in the hill country of Judah, about 13 miles (20\.9 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem, and took a northwesterly course to the Mediterranean Sea. It is identifiable with the Wadi es\-Sarar. The Danites attempted to settle this area but were driven out by the Philistines in the region by the Mediterranean. The town of Zorah, Samson’s birthplace, was near the head of the valley of Zorek, which provided the setting for his intrigues and the concentration of his activities as judge.
