## Birzaith, Birzavith (id: 4254)

BIRZAITH, BIRZAVITH\*
=====================

Malchiel’s son of Asher’s tribe ([1 Chr 7:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:31)). Since parallel lists fail to mention him ([Gn 46:17](https://ref.ly/Gen46:17); [Nm 26:44–47](https://ref.ly/Num26:44-Num26:47)), it is possible that Birzaith (kjv “Birzavith”) was the name of a city Malchiel founded. If so, the city may have been northwest of Bethel, near Tyre, and is now called Birzeit.
