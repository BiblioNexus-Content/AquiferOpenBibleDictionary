He was the second priest under Seraiah the chief priest and served as Zedekiah’s envoy to Jeremiah during the period prior to the fall of Jerusalem ([Jer 21:1](https://ref.ly/Jer21:1); [29:25–29](https://ref.ly/Jer29:25-Jer29:29); [37:3](https://ref.ly/Jer37:3)).

3\. Author of the book of Zephaniah ([Zep 1:1](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:1)). Though little is known about Zephaniah, it is possible that his ancestor Hezekiah is the same as the king by that name. *See* Zephaniah, Book of.
