## Bdellium (id: 4041)

BDELLIUM
========

Bdellium is an aromatic gum resin that looks similar to myrrh. It comes from various trees of the *Commiphora* genus that grow in Africa and western Asia. Most scholars believe the bdellium mentioned in [Genesis 2:12](https://ref.ly/Gen2:12) and [Numbers 11:7](https://ref.ly/Num11:7) comes from the *Commiphora africana*, a shrub that grows naturally in southern Arabia and northeastern Africa. This yellowish, transparent, fragrant resin looks like a pearl.

The Bible describes the manna gathered by the Israelites as having the same color as bdellium ([Numbers 11:7](https://ref.ly/Num11:7)). Bdellium is also mentioned along with gold and onyx stone found near the garden of Eden ([Genesis 2:12](https://ref.ly/Gen2:12)). Because it appeared in this list of valuable items, people once thought bdellium might be pearl or a precious stone.

The *Commiphora* genus includes the plants that produce myrrh and possibly what the Bible calls "balm." Outside the Bible, an English plant expert described bdellium as an aromatic gum from a tree known in Persia and beyond. The Roman writer Pliny, who lived in the first century AD, also described bdellium as a waxy substance that resembled a pearl.
