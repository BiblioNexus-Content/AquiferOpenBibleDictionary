## Anathoth (Place), Anathothite (id: 3599)

ANATHOTH (PLACE), ANATHOTHITE
=============================

A town in Benjamin’s territory given to the Levites to live in ([Joshua 21:18](https://ref.ly/Josh21:18); [1 Chronicles 6:60](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:60)). Anathoth may have been named by the Canaanites for their goddess Anath or later by the Israelites for one of Benjamin’s descendants ([1 Chronicles 7:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:8)). 

The town was probably located at Ras el\-Karrubeh near the modern town of Anata 4\.8 kilometers (three miles) north of Jerusalem. Its residents were sometimes called Anethothites or Anetothites ([2 Samuel 23:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:27); [1 Chronicles 27:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:12)). 

One of David’s military leaders, Abiezer, was from Anathoth ([1 Chronicles 11:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:28), King James Version “Antothite”). The soldier Jehu ([1 Chronicles 12:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:3)) and the priest Abiathar ([1 Kings 2:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26)) were also from Anothoth. 

It was also the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Jer1:1)). Some of its residents violently opposed him ([Jeremiah 11:21](https://ref.ly/Jer11:21), [23](https://ref.ly/Jer11:23)). Just before Judah fell to Babylon, Jeremiah bought a field in Anathoth as a sign that Israel would be restored to her land ([Jeremiah 32:7–9](https://ref.ly/Jer32:7-Jer32:9)). Years later, 128 men of Anathoth returned from the exile. They resettled the town ([Nehemiah 11:32](https://ref.ly/Neh11:32)).
