## Jahaziel (id: 6175)

JAHAZIEL
========

1\. Warrior from Benjamin’s tribe who joined David at Ziklag in his struggle against King Saul. Jahaziel was one of David’s ambidextrous archers and slingers ([1 Chr 12:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:4)).

2\. One of the two priests David appointed to blow trumpets before the ark as it was brought into the tent in Jerusalem, where it remained until the completion of the temple by Solomon ([1 Chr 16:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:6)).

3\. Levite belonging to the Kohathite division appointed by David to temple duties ([1 Chr 23:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:19); [24:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:23)).

4\. Levite of the sons of Asaph who encouraged Jehoshaphat and the army of Judah not to be dismayed by the size of Moabite and Ammonite armies coming against them but to stand still and see the victory of the Lord ([2 Chr 20:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:14)). Jehoshaphat’s response exemplified a godly king encouraging his people to have faith in the Lord their God (vv [18–21](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:18-2Chr20:21)).

5\. Shecaniah’s father. Shecaniah returned to Jerusalem with Ezra after the exile ([Ezr 8:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:5)).
