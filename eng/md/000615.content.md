## Aven (id: 3885)

AVEN
====

1. A term used by the prophet Ezekiel to describe the city of On, which is also called Heliopolis. On was the center of worship of the Egyptian sun god Ra ([Ezekiel 30:17](https://ref.ly/Ezek30:17)). The Hebrew word *aven* (“wickedness”) was similar to the name On. It was used in a prophecy against the idolatry and wickedness of Egypt.

    *See* Heliopolis.

2. A description of Bethel ([Hosea 10:8](https://ref.ly/Hos10:8)), shortened from Beth\-aven, “house of wickedness” ([Hosea 4:15](https://ref.ly/Hos4:15); [5:8](https://ref.ly/Hos5:8); [10:5](https://ref.ly/Hos10:5)). The prophet Hosea was criticizing the northern kingdom’s idolatry. Bethel was a center of idolatry in the north ([1 Kings 12:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)[29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)).

    *See* Beth\-aven \#2.

3. A valley where Syria was going to be punished because of its crimes against the Lord ([Amos 1:5](https://ref.ly/Amos1:5)). It might be a vague reference to Baalbek, the center of Syria’s Baal worship in the Beqa’a valley.
