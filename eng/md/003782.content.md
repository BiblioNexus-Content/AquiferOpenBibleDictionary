## Memorial (id: 7041)

MEMORIAL
========

A memorial is something that helps us remember certain people or events. In both everyday and biblical language, "remember," "remembrance," and "memorial" are closely connected. The Hebrew and Greek words for "memorial" in the Old and New Testaments come from verbs that mean "to remember." To understand "memorial," we must first know the biblical meaning of "to remember."

Biblical Meaning of "To Remember"
---------------------------------

In everyday use, "remember" means recalling the past. "Memorial" refers to something that keeps a memory alive. However, in the Bible, “to remember” often has a deeper meaning. It does not just mean thinking about the past. It means remembering in a way that changes how someone feels, thinks, or acts now. For example, [Genesis 8:1](https://ref.ly/Gen8:1)says God "remembered Noah." It means he took action on Noah's behalf, not just that he thought of him. It includes this idea, to be sure, but more than this, it means that God is acting on Noah’s behalf. In a similar way, when [Genesis 30:22](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22) says God “remembered Rachel,” it means he was about to answer her prayer for a child after a long time of waiting.

Memorial in the Old Testament
-----------------------------

The Old Testament often tells the Israelites to remember the great things God had done for them ([Psalms 77:11](https://ref.ly/Ps77:11); [78:7](https://ref.ly/Ps78:7); [105:5](https://ref.ly/Ps105:5)). It was not just about recalling the past. It meant living in the present with faith, knowing what God had done before. Forgetting God’s past deeds often led to Israel turning away from him ([Psalm 78:11, 42](https://ref.ly/Ps78:11,Ps78:42); [106:7, 13, 21–22](https://ref.ly/Ps106:7,Ps106:13,Ps106:21-Ps106:22)).

Looking at how the word "memorial" is often used to mean active remembering. One clear example is how it is used in connection with the Passover. In [Exodus 12:14](https://ref.ly/Exod12:14), the Passover is called a "memorial." So, it was not just about remembering the exodus from Egypt as a historical event. It was a time for the Israelites to live in the present. They should remember God's deliverance from sin and slavery.

Similarly, [Joshua 4:7](https://ref.ly/Josh4:7) describes the setting up of twelve stones in the Jordan River as a "memorial." This memorial helped the Israelites remember how God helped them cross into Canaan. his memorial is to be “for the people of Israel forever.” They reminded the people of how God had saved them in the past. This memory was meant to give them courage when they faced hard times in the future.

Another example is the "memorial stones" on the high priest’s special garment called an "ephod" ([Exodus 28:12, 29](https://ref.ly/Exod28:12,Exod28:29); [39:7](https://ref.ly/Exod39:7)). These stones were to bring the names of the sons of Israel before the Lord. They were not just to remind God of the Israelites. They symbolized his ongoing concern for their well\-being.

The term "memorial" is used differently in regards to the grain offering in [Leviticus 2:2, 16](https://ref.ly/Lev2:2,Lev2:16). Here, "memorial" means the part of the grain offering burned on the altar. The rest was to feed the priests. The memorial represents the whole offering. This memorial is not just a reminder to God but is seen as a part of the offering itself.

Memorial in the New Testament
-----------------------------

The New Testament uses "memorial" and "remembrance" less often. But, they have a special meaning in one instance. When Jesus established the Lord's Supper, the New Testament Passover, he said, "This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me” ([Luke 22:19](https://ref.ly/Luke22:19)). The Lord’s Supper is a memorial of Christ’s suffering and death. It is not just about recalling a historical event. It is about remembering in a way that makes believers thankful and affects them today.
