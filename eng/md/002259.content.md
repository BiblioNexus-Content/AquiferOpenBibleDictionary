## Gorgias (id: 5513)

GORGIAS
=======

One of the three generals chosen by Lysias, who was “governor of the kingdom, as far as the bounds of Egypt, and of the Lower Asia, and reaching from the river Euphrates,” according to Josephus, early Jewish historian. The three, Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, are described as “mighty men among the friends of the king” ([1 Macc 3:38](https://ref.ly/1Macc3:38)). They were commissioned to go into Judah and destroy it but were completely defeated, although they greatly outnumbered the forces of Judas Maccabeus ([4:1–22](https://ref.ly/1Macc4:1-1Macc4:22)). On another occasion Joseph and Azariah were defeated when they disobeyed the orders of Judas and attacked Gorgias at Jamnia ([5:56–60](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:56-1Macc5:60)). It is probable that Jamnia is the correct reading for Idumea, which is found in [2 Maccabees 12:32](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:32).
