## Chesalon (id: 4512)

CHESALON
========

A city in northern Judah near the border of the territory of Dan. The city was built on the northern side of Mount Jearim. Today, this place is believed to be a site called Kesla, which is about 14\.5 kilometers (nine miles) west of Jerusalem. 

The Bible mentions Chesalon only once, when describing how the Israelites, led by Joshua, took control of the land of Canaan ([Joshua 15:10](https://ref.ly/Josh15:10)).
