## Fitch (id: 5272)

FITCH\*
=======

KJV translation of two Hebrew words. “Fitch” is actually an older form of the word “vetch,” the name of many species of leguminous plants. The “fitch” of [Isaiah 28:25–27](https://ref.ly/Isa28:25-Isa28:27) (nlt “dill”) is the nutmeg flower, the seeds of which are used as a condiment. The “fitch” of [Ezekiel 4:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:9) (nlt “spelt”) is probably emmer, an inferior kind of wheat.
