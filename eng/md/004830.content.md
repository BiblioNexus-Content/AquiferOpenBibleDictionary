SAILORS
=======

Men who are trained in sailing ships at sea. The people of Israel did not generally sail on the ocean. Most sailors and fishers in Israel operated on the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River. Scripture mentions large ships occasionally ([Genesis 49:13](https://ref.ly/Gen49:13); [Judges 5:17](https://ref.ly/Judg5:17)). Solomon had a fleet of ships at Ezion\-geber on the Gulf of Aqaba ([1 Kings 9:26–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28); [2 Chronicles 8:17–18](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:17-2Chr8:18); [9:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:21)). Jehoshaphat also had a fleet at Ezion\-geber ([1 Kings 22:48](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:48); [2 Chronicles 20:35–37](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:35-2Chr20:37)).

The New Testament frequently mentions ships and sailors. Many fishing boats operated in Galilee ([Matthew 14:22](https://ref.ly/Matt14:22); [Mark 1:19](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19); [3:9](https://ref.ly/Mark3:9); [Luke 5:2](https://ref.ly/Luke5:2); [John 6:19, 22–24](https://ref.ly/John6:19,John6:22-John6:24); [21:8](https://ref.ly/John21:8)). Paul traveled to Rome on a large ship ([Acts 27:6–44](https://ref.ly/Acts27:6-Acts27:44)). Shipmen or sailors are mentioned in [Acts 27:27, 30](https://ref.ly/Acts27:27,Acts27:30). The term "mariner" (King James Version) refers to a sailor ([Ezekiel 27:9, 27–29](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:9,Ezek27:27-Ezek27:29); [Jonah 1:5](https://ref.ly/Jonah1:5)).
