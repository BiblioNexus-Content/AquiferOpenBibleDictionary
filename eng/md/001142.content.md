## Calneh (id: 4397)

CALNEH
======

1\. City in Babylon ([Gn 10:10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:10)).

2\. City identified as Kullani (Kullan Koy), about 20 miles (32\.2 kilometers) north of Aleppo in northern Syria. This northern identification is hinted at in [Isaiah 10:9](https://ref.ly/Isa10:9), where Calno is associated with Carchemish, some 50 miles (80\.5 kilometers) to the northeast, as well as in the context of [Amos 6:2](https://ref.ly/Amos6:2) (note the north\-to\-south progression—Calneh, Hamath, Gath). Canneh in [Ezekiel 27:23](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:23) seems to refer to the same general location and is perhaps to be linked with Calneh. Kullani was captured by Tiglath\-pileser II, king of Assyria, about 741 BC.
