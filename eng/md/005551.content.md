## The Destroyer (id: 4820)

THE DESTROYER
=============

1. A divine agent sent to carry out a sentence of destruction. The destroyer killed Egypt's firstborn. This ended the plagues and freed the Hebrews from slavery ([Exodus 12:23](https://ref.ly/Exod12:23); compare [Hebrews 11:28](https://ref.ly/Heb11:28)). The apostle Paul used the term for God’s judgment on the rebellious Israelites in the wilderness ([1 Corinthians 10:10](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:10); compare [Numbers 16:44–50](https://ref.ly/Num16:44-Num16:50)).
2. In plural form, “destroyers” implies a group that causes destruction, either angels or humans ([Job 33:22](https://ref.ly/Job33:22); [Jeremiah 22:7](https://ref.ly/Jer22:7)).
3. More broadly, the "destroyer" is any agent that causes destruction ([Job 15:21](https://ref.ly/Job15:21); [Jeremiah 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jer4:7)).
4. Samson was called a destroyer by the Philistine who held him captive ([Judges 16:24](https://ref.ly/Judg16:24)).
