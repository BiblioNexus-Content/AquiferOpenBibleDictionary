## Phoebe (id: 7720)

PHOEBE
======

Christian woman of the church at Cenchrea, the eastern port for the city of Corinth. In [Romans 16:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:2), Paul commended Phoebe to the recipients of the letter on the basis of her valuable service to other Christians. He asked that they give her whatever assistance she needed.

The term “deacon” is applied to Phoebe. It probably designates an official position in the church, as in [Philippians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Phil1:1), although it may mean “minister” in the same sense that Paul uses it elsewhere of himself and others ([1 Cor 3:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:5); [2 Cor 3:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:6); [6:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4)).
