## CIty of the Sun (id: 8651)

CITY OF THE SUN
===============

A phrase in [Isaiah 19:18](https://ref.ly/Isa19:18) that many Bible scholars believe refers to Heliopolis, an ancient Egyptian city. Heliopolis means "City of the Sun" in Greek. The city was a major center for sun worship in ancient Egypt, which explains why it was called the "City of the Sun." Some Hebrew manuscripts read *'ir ha\-heres* ("City of Destruction") instead, possibly reflecting a scribal variation or intentional alteration.

*See* Heliopolis.
