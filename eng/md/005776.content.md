## Vow, Vows (id: 9021)

VOW, VOWS
=========

Serious promises or pledges made to God.

Vows as a Religious Practice
----------------------------

Making vows to God is a religious practice mentioned often in Scripture. Most references to vows are found in the Old Testament, especially in the Psalms. There are some vows mentioned in the New Testament

Tithing, sacrifices and offerings, keeping the Sabbath, and circumcision were all commanded by the Mosaic law. Making vows was not. For example, [Psalm 50:14](https://ref.ly/Ps50:14) says, "Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High." The command is to keep or fulfill a pledge that has already been made. No order is given to make a promise, only to fulfill one when it is made. The practice is accepted and regulated but not demanded.

Types of Vows in the Bible
--------------------------

The purpose of a vow is to win favor from the Lord, to express gratitude to him for some deliverance or benefit, or to prove absolute devotion to him. Personal dedication and separation to the Lord were the main features of the Nazirite vow. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist are the most familiar examples of those who took this type of vow. [Numbers 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Num6:1-Num6:8) outlines the conditions of this commitment. Verses [13–21](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21) tell how to be released from the vow. Women might also take this vow (verse [2](https://ref.ly/Num6:2)), and it might only be for a designated time. The Recabite clan pledged themselves to a simple and unsettled life. They are a compelling illustration of loyalty to the God of Israel ([Jeremiah 35](https://ref.ly/Jer35:1-Jer35:19)).

Some vows were taken as a type of bargain with God. At Bethel, Jacob promised God worship and the tithe if God would protect him and supply his needs ([Genesis 28:20](https://ref.ly/Gen28:20-Gen28:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[22](https://ref.ly/Gen28:20-Gen28:22)). Hannah pledged that if God would give her a son, she would return him to God ([1 Samuel 1:11, 27](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11,1Sam1:27-1Sam1:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[28](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11,1Sam1:27-1Sam1:28)). In the Psalms, paying a vow is often associated with thanksgiving for deliverance from danger or affliction (for example, [Psalms 22:24](https://ref.ly/Ps22:24-Ps22:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[25](https://ref.ly/Ps22:24-Ps22:25); [56:12](https://ref.ly/Ps56:12-Ps56:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[13](https://ref.ly/Ps56:12-Ps56:13)).

Once a vow is made, the obligation is serious. Not making a vow is not sin ([Deuteronomy 23:22](https://ref.ly/Deut23:22)). Once declared, the vow must be kept ([Deuteronomy 23:21](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[23](https://ref.ly/Deut23:21-Deut23:23); see also [Numbers 30:2](https://ref.ly/Num30:2); [Ecclesiastes 5:4](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:4-Eccl5:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[6](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:4-Eccl5:6)).

Vows in the New Testament
-------------------------

"Vow" is used only twice in the New Testament. Both uses are connected to the apostle Paul ([Acts 18:18](https://ref.ly/Acts18:18); [21:23](https://ref.ly/Acts21:23-Acts21:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[24](https://ref.ly/Acts21:23-Acts21:24)). But the same principle is involved in the case of the word "Corban" ([Mark 7:11](https://ref.ly/Mark7:11-Mark7:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[13](https://ref.ly/Mark7:11-Mark7:13); compare [Matthew 15:5](https://ref.ly/Matt15:5-Matt15:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Num6:13-Num6:21)[6](https://ref.ly/Matt15:5-Matt15:6)). In these two passages, Jesus rebuked those who made a vow because the vow was a way to get out of another obligation. Money was involved in such a "gift" or "offering." But Jesus said that God did not want a gift designed to deny others of care.

Paul may have taken vows to avoid the common objections Jews and Jewish\-Christian believers made about him. They often objected to the way Paul lifted the obligations of Mosaic law for gentile believers. Paul was in Jerusalem under the watch of Jewish authorities. He made it a point to join with four other Jewish believers in paying vows in the temple. His enemies then charged Paul with bringing Gentiles into the holy temple.
