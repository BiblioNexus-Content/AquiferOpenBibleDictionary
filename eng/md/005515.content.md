## Tema (Place) (id: 8779)

TEMA (Place)
============

Tema was a town generally identified with Teima'. This place was an oasis located 321\.8 kilometers (200 miles) north of Medina and 64\.4 kilometers (40 miles) south of Dumah. Teima’ was on an ancient caravan route that connected the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Aqaba. This means it was an important stop for traders traveling through the desert.

In the writings of the prophets, Tema is mentioned together with Dedan and Buz as Arabian oases that would not escape God's judgment ([Isaiah 21:14](https://ref.ly/Isa21:14); [Jeremiah 25:23](https://ref.ly/Jer25:23)). The passage in Jeremiah contains a reference to the residents of Dedan, Tema, and Buz being among those who "cut the corners of their hair."

The practice of cutting the corners of the hair would make them different from the Jewish people. Jews left the corners of their hair uncut ([Leviticus 19:27](https://ref.ly/Lev19:27)). Like uncircumcision, the practice of cutting the corners of the hair would identify the men of Tema as non\-Jewish people who followed other religions.
