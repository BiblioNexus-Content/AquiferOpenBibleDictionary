## Nations (id: 7314)

NATIONS
=======

Nations are groups formed based on political or social interests, or family relationships. The term "nations" usually refers to people worldwide other than the Hebrews, but it can also include the Jews.

Where Did the Nations Come From?
--------------------------------

The book of Genesis says Noah's three sons began the different "families" or ethnic groups (about 70 in total) who lived in the eastern Mediterranean regions ([Genesis 10](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32)). The story assumes each group has its own land and language ([Genesis 10:5, 20, 31](https://ref.ly/Gen10:5,Gen10:20,Gen10:31)). 

The story of the tower of Babel in [Genesis 11](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:32), a tall tower (called a ziggurat) meant to reach heaven, explains that language differences separated these groups. This scattering prevented them from working together on ambitious projects.

In his sermon in Athens, Paul suggests that all nations share a common origin, similar to the writer of Genesis. He accepts that God intended for nations to have separate geographical boundaries ([Acts 17:26](https://ref.ly/Acts17:26)). 

The prophet Zephaniah anticipated a future when God would unite all nations under one language ([Zephaniah 3:9](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:9)). 

In Revelation, the writer envisions a new heaven and earth where these boundaries disappear. Nations freely mix in the new Jerusalem ([Revelation 21:22–26](https://ref.ly/Rev21:22-Rev21:26)).

The difference between "Israel" and "the nations" is not obvious. "Israel" came from various ethnic groups, and some of "the nations" traced their roots to important figures in the Israelite community. Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, lived in Ur of the Chaldees in the Tigris\-Euphrates valley. He migrated north to Haran with his father and then southwest to Canaan ([Genesis 11:31–12:9](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31-Gen12:9)). [Deuteronomy 26:5](https://ref.ly/Deut26:5) ("My father was a wandering Aramean") suggests Abraham lived in Mesopotamia, known as Aram\-naharaim. 

When Abraham made a covenant (special agreement) with God, God gave him circumcision as a sign of this covenant. Foreigners bought as slaves were circumcised, including them in the covenant community. When Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt into the wilderness, a mixed group also went with them ([Exodus 12:38](https://ref.ly/Exod12:38)), showing that people not biologically related still identified with the people of Israel.

The nation of Israel did not include everyone descended from Abraham. Abraham's first son, Ishmael, had an Egyptian mother and is the ancestor of the Ishmaelites, nomads who roamed the southern wilderness ([Genesis 16](https://ref.ly/Gen16:1-Gen16:16)). Of Isaac and Rebekah's twin sons, Esau, the firstborn, is the ancestor of the Edomites who lived in the southeast and were traditional enemies of Israel ([Genesis 25:23](https://ref.ly/Gen25:23); [Numbers 20:21](https://ref.ly/Num20:21)).

God and the Nations
-------------------

Scripture shows both negative and positive views of the nations. The nations between the Tigris\-Euphrates Valley and the Nile River were seen as wicked. Therefore, God took their land and gave it to Abraham's descendants ([Genesis 15:16–20](https://ref.ly/Gen15:16-Gen15:20)). 

These nations were known for incest, adultery, homosexuality, and relationships between men and animals, which displeased God ([Leviticus 18](https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30)). They practiced spiritism (communicating with spirits), fortune\-telling, witchcraft, and communicating with the dead, so the Hebrews were told to avoid these activities ([Leviticus 19:26](https://ref.ly/Lev19:26); [Leviticus 20:6](https://ref.ly/Lev20:6)). The nations worshiped many gods and practiced human sacrifice, often of children, which God detests ([Leviticus 20:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev20:1-Lev20:5); [2 Kings 17:29–34](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:29-2Kgs17:34)). 

The prophet Isaiah criticized craftsmen who used part of a tree to make a fire and the rest to create an idol to worship ([Isaiah 44:12–20](https://ref.ly/Isa44:12-Isa44:20)). The fertility gods Baalim and Ashteroth of the Canaanites often tempted the people of Israel. Scripture repeatedly says that God would drive out these nations and give their land to Israel for these reasons ([Exodus 34:24](https://ref.ly/Exod34:24); [Deuteronomy 12:29–31](https://ref.ly/Deut12:29-Deut12:31)). The prophetic messages against the nations supported this negative view ([Jeremiah 46–51](https://ref.ly/Jer46:1-Jer51:64); [Amos 1:3–2:3](https://ref.ly/Amos1:3-Amos2:3)).

However, Scripture also shows a positive view of other nations. In the book of Psalms, God cares not only for Israel but watches over all nations. The entire earth praises and worships him ([Psalm 66:1–8](https://ref.ly/Ps66:1-Ps66:8)). The psalmist prays for God's saving power to be known among all nations. He states that God judges people fairly and guides nations. Everyone on earth should respect him ([Psalm 67:7](https://ref.ly/Ps67:7)). 

The prophet Isaiah says the Jerusalem temple should be a house of prayer for all people. God welcomes foreigners who come with sacrifices and worship ([Isaiah 56:6–8](https://ref.ly/Isa56:6-Isa56:8)). Isaiah's hopeful vision for the future shows people from all nations coming to Jerusalem to worship the Lord and learn his ways. Instead of nations fighting, all will live in peace under God's rule ([Isaiah 2:2–4](https://ref.ly/Isa2:2-Isa2:4)).

The Nations in the New Testament
--------------------------------

According to the Gospels, Jesus helped both Jews and non\-Jews (called "gentiles"). This fulfilled ancient prophecy ([Matthew 4:15–16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:15-Matt4:16)). Jesus taught in Galilee, which was a mostly non\-Jewish area. He traveled to Tyre and Sidon ([Mark 7:24](https://ref.ly/Mark7:24)). He also traveled through the region of the Decapolis ([Mark 7:31](https://ref.ly/Mark7:31)). He ministered to: 

* A Roman centurion ([Luke 7:1–10](https://ref.ly/Luke7:1-Luke7:10))
* The widow of Nain ([Luke 7:11–17](https://ref.ly/Luke7:11-Luke7:17))
* A Syrophoenician woman ([Mark 7:26](https://ref.ly/Mark7:26))

People from Idumea came to see his miracles ([Mark 3:8](https://ref.ly/Mark3:8)).

Jesus taught about many topics. The story of the great judgment in [Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46) shows all nations gathered before the Son of Man. Jesus tells the apostles to “make disciples of all nations” ([Matthew 28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19)).

The book of Acts acknowledges the nations' role in Jesus's death ([Acts 4:27](https://ref.ly/Acts4:27)). It also acknowledges their opposition to Paul's ministry ([Acts 26:17](https://ref.ly/Acts26:17)). However, it shows that the church successfully shared the good news about Jesus with non\-Jewish people. Peter shares the message about Jesus with Cornelius, a Roman soldier from the Italian Regiment ([Acts 10](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48)). 

Initially, the early church resisted the idea that non\-Jewish people could freely receive the Holy Spirit, but they eventually accepted it ([Acts 11:1–8](https://ref.ly/Acts11:1-Acts11:8); [15:1–29](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1-Acts15:29)). Paul traveled through Cyprus, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, founding or visiting churches mainly composed of non\-Jewish believers. The book of Acts ends with Paul dramatically preaching the good news about Jesus in Rome, the center of the Roman Empire.
