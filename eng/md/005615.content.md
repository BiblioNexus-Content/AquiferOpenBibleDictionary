## Tirzah (Place) (id: 8866)

TIRZAH (Place)
==============

Tirzah was the early capital city of the divided kingdom of Israel ([1 Kings 14:17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:17); [15:21, 33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:21,1Kgs15:33); [16:6–23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:6-1Kgs16:23)). It was one of the cities captured by Joshua during Israel's conquest of Canaan ([Joshua 12:24](https://ref.ly/Josh12:24)). 

Tirzah became an important city when King Jeroboam made it his home ([1 Kings 14:17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:17)). Baasha planned to move his capital to Ramah but his war against Asa forced him to return to Tirzah ([1 Kings 15:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:21)). Tirzah also served as the capital city for the kings Elah, Zimri, and Omri during the first six years of Omri’s reign. But when Omri built a new capital called Samaria, Tirzah became less important.

In 753 BC, King Menahem used Tirzah to revolt against King Shallum ([2 Kings 15:14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:14)). This might have been because of the rivalry between the cities of Tirzah and Samaria.

The city was known for being beautiful ([Song of Solomon 6:4](https://ref.ly/Song6:4)). It was built on a high hill, which would have given people a great view of the surrounding area. However, today we do not know exactly where the city was located.
