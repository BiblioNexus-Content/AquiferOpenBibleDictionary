## Hananiah (id: 5638)

HANANIAH
========

1. A son of Zerubbabel and descendant of King David ([1 Chronicles 3:19, 21](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:19,1Chr3:21)).
2. A member of the tribe of Benjamin and the son of Shashak ([1 Chronicles 8:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:24)).
3. A son of Heman who led the 16th group of musicians who served in the temple of the Lord. These musicians were divided into 24 groups ([1 Chronicles 25:4, 23](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:4,1Chr25:23)).
4. One of the commanders of King Uzziah’s army ([2 Chronicles 26:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:11)).
5. A son of Bebai who returned from exile in Babylon. Ezra later urged him to end his marriage to a non\-Jewish wife ([Ezra 10:28](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:28)).
6. A maker of perfumes who helped Nehemiah rebuild the Jerusalem wall ([Nehemiah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Neh3:8)).
7. A son of Shelemiah who, along with Hanun, repaired part of the Jerusalem wall during Nehemiah's time ([Nehemiah 3:30](https://ref.ly/Neh3:30)). He is perhaps the same person as \#6 above.
8. Commander of the citadel of Jerusalem. Nehemiah chose him to rule the city together with Hanani, Nehemiah’s brother. Hananiah was described as a faithful and God\-fearing man. He was given the task of making sure the city walls and gates were guarded ([Nehemiah 7:2–3](https://ref.ly/Neh7:2-Neh7:3)).
9. One of the leaders who signed his name to Ezra's agreement (covenant) with God ([Nehemiah 10:23](https://ref.ly/Neh10:23)).
10. The head of the priestly family of Jeremiah when Joiakim was high priest in Jerusalem after the exile ([Nehemiah 12:12](https://ref.ly/Neh12:12)).
11. One of the priests who blew a trumpet at the dedication of the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah ([Nehemiah 12:41](https://ref.ly/Neh12:41)).
12. A Gibeonite and the son of Azzur. Hananiah claimed to be a prophet during the fourth year of King Zedekiah of Judah’s reign. Zedekiah was king of Judah from 597 to 586 BC. In the temple, Hananiah announced that within two years, the Lord would break Nebuchadnezzar's control over Judah and bring back all the people and sacred objects that had been taken to Babylon. However, the Lord told Jeremiah that Hananiah was lying. Jeremiah then told Hananiah he would die for spreading false messages, and Hananiah died two months later ([Jeremiah 28](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)).
13. The father of Zedekiah, who was an official serving King Jehoiakim of Judah (who ruled from 609 to 598 BC; [Jeremiah 36:12](https://ref.ly/Jer36:12)).
14. The grandfather of Irijah, the captain of the guards. Irijah arrested Jeremiah at Jerusalem’s Gate of Benjamin for apparently deserting to the Babylonians ([Jeremiah 37:13](https://ref.ly/Jer37:13)).
15. One of Daniel's three Jewish friends who were taken to Babylon. The Babylonians called him Shadrach ([Daniel 1:6–19](https://ref.ly/Dan1:6-Dan1:19); [2:17](https://ref.ly/Dan2:17)).
