Hanani was imprisoned for his preaching ([2 Chr 16:1–10](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:1-2Chr16:10)). Hanani was the father of the prophet Jehu, who made protests against Baasha, king of Israel ([1 Kgs 16:1–7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:1-1Kgs16:7)), and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah ([2 Chr 19:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr19:2)).
