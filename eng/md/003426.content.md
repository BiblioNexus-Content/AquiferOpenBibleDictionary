## Lasciviousness (id: 6683)

LASCIVIOUSNESS
==============

Lasciviousness is a strong and uncontrolled desire for sensual pleasure. Modern Bible translations commonly use the words "licentiousness," "debauchery," or "sensuality" instead. Lasciviousness occurs when the pursuit of pleasure goes to the extreme of completely disregarding the dignity of other people and the environment.

The Bible gives several examples of this kind of behavior:

* The people of Sodom and Gomorrah lived in ways that went against God's laws ([2 Peter 2:7\).](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:7)
* Some false teachers told people they could do whatever they wanted. But these teachers themselves were controlled by their own wrong desires ([2 Peter 2:2, 18–19](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:2,2Pet2:18-2Pet2:19); compare [Jude 4](https://ref.ly/Jude1:4)).
* Some non\-Jewish people (gentiles) strongly desired to do all kinds of wrong things ([Ephesians 4:19](https://ref.ly/Eph4:19)).

In his letters, Paul often wrote about people who could not control their sexual desires ("debauchery" in [Romans 13:13](https://ref.ly/Rom13:13); [2 Corinthians 12:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:21); [Galatians 5:19](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19)). This is also likely what Jesus was talking about in [Mark 7:22](https://ref.ly/Mark7:22).
