## Zanoah (Person) (id: 9135)

ZANOAH (Person)
===============

Descendant of Caleb from Judah’s tribe ([1 Chr 4:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:18)). Zanoah was the son of Jekuthiel and, depending on the translation of the Hebrew text, may have been related to Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh. Some have interpreted the text as indicating that Jekuthiel was the founder or principal settler of the city named Zanoah. In any case, Zanoah’s descendants may well have been connected with the city of that name.
