## Elihoreph (id: 5009)

ELIHOREPH
=========

Prominent official in the time of Solomon ([1 Kgs 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:3)) who, with his brother Ahijah, was a royal secretary. Attempts to regard Elihoreph as the title of an official and not a personal name find no support in the Hebrew text.

* **Associated Passages:** 1KI 4:3
