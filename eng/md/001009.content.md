## Boar (id: 4280)

BOAR
====

A wild or tame animal of the swine family. Boars were known for being strong and destructive.

In [Psalm 80:13](https://ref.ly/Ps80:13), a wild boar is pictured as ruining a vineyard. This image shows how enemies were destroying Israel, which was often compared to a vineyard in the Bible.

Pigs and boars were considered unclean animals in Israelite law. People did not eat them or offer them as sacrifices.
