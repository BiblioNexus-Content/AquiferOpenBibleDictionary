## Zobah (id: 9251)

ZOBAH
=====

Zobah was an Aramean nation that was defeated by Israel during the early kingdom period. King Saul won battles against the kings of Zobah ([1 Samuel 14:47](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:47)). 

Soon after David became king of Israel, he defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah ([2 Samuel 8:3–5, 12](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:3-2Sam8:5,2Sam8:12); [1 Chronicles 18:3–10](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:3-1Chr18:10); [Psalm 60 title](https://ref.ly/Ps60:1)). Later, the Ammonites hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from Beth\-rehob and Zobah for an anticipated attack by the military forces of David. Joab led Israel’s army and defeated the combined forces of the Ammonites and their hired Aramean allies ([2 Samuel 10:6–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6-2Sam10:14)). Afterward, Hadadezer sent reinforcements, but David himself led Israel to another victory over the Arameans ([2 Samuel 10:15–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:15-2Sam10:19); [1 Chronicles 19:16–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:16-1Chr19:19)).
