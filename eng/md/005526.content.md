## Tentmaker (id: 8786)

TENTMAKER
=========

Artisans who made tents from the cloth woven from the hair of goats. The Greek term for tentmaker may have described a range of activities in cloth and leather. The single biblical reference ([Acts 18:3](https://ref.ly/Acts18:3)) is to Aquila and Priscilla of Corinth. They worked as tentmakers. The apostle Paul joined them because he had trained in the same craft. He made a regular living at this trade during his missionary journeys ([2 Corinthians 11:7–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:7-2Cor11:10); [1 Thessalonians 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:9); [2 Thessalonians 3:8](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:8)).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 18:3; 1TH 2:9; 2TH 3:8; 2CO 11:7–2CO 11:10
