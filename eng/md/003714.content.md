## Master (id: 6973)

MASTER, MISTRESS
================

Someone who has control, authority, or ownership over something or someone. The term "master" is used to indicate someone of high rank. "Mistress" is the female equivalent of "master." A master can be:

* someone who owns an animal or property ([Isaiah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Isa1:3))
* someone in charge of a household ([Mark 13:35](https://ref.ly/Mark13:35))
* someone who owns servants or slaves ([Genesis 16:9](https://ref.ly/Gen16:9); [39:3](https://ref.ly/Gen39:3); [Ephesians 6:5](https://ref.ly/Eph6:5))
* an employer ([Luke 16:3](https://ref.ly/Luke16:3))
* a teacher ([Luke 9:49](https://ref.ly/Luke9:49); compare [Mark 9:38](https://ref.ly/Mark9:38), which uses "teacher" instead of "master")
* the Lord God ([Ephesians 6:9](https://ref.ly/Eph6:9))

The word "master" is often used to describe Jesus. When the Greek word *kurios* (usually translated as "Lord") refers to Jesus, it emphasizes both the authority God gave him and his role in the lives of believers.
