## Zodiac (id: 9253)

ZODIAC
======

A circle of twelve groups of stars (called constellations) used in astrology to predict events or describe personality. In the ancient world around Israel, the zodiac was part of pagan worship and fortune\-telling. The Bible forbids God’s people to seek guidance from these practices ([Isaiah 47:13–14](https://ref.ly/Isa47:13-Isa47:14)).
