## Eshtaol (id: 5153)

ESHTAOL
=======

Lowland town on the border between Judah and Dan ([Jos 15:33](https://ref.ly/Josh15:33); [19:41](https://ref.ly/Josh19:41)), always mentioned along with nearby Zorah. In this area the young Samson began to be moved by the Spirit of the Lord ([Jgs 13:25](https://ref.ly/Judg13:25)), and here he was later buried ([16:31](https://ref.ly/Judg16:31)). Dan’s tribe sent out five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to seek additional land for tribal expansion. When they reported the vulnerability of the city of Laish, 600 men from Zorah and Eshtaol attacked it, opening the area for occupation by the Danites (ch [18](https://ref.ly/Judg18:1-Judg18:31)).
