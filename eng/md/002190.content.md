## Gibbethon (id: 5446)

GIBBETHON
=========

City in the western part of central Palestine. It was located in the territory of Dan ([Jos 19:44](https://ref.ly/Josh19:44)) and allotted to the Levite clan of Kohath ([21:23](https://ref.ly/Josh21:23)). Baasha killed King Nadab at Gibbethon when Israel was taking the city from the Philistines ([1 Kgs 15:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27)). About 26 years later, Omri was proclaimed king at Gibbethon ([16:17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:17)).
