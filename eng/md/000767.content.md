## Battlement (id: 4036)

BATTLEMENT
==========

A defensive wall with openings for shooting, typically found on top of a fortress, can also refer to a parapet or railing around any flat roof. 

In the Near East, houses were often built with flat roofs, which were used for various purposes: 

* Rahab hid two Israelite spies on her roof ([Joshua 2:6](https://ref.ly/Josh2:6))
* Saul slept on Samuel’s roof ([1 Samuel 9:25](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:25))
* King David, from his roof, saw Bathsheba taking a bath ([2 Samuel 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2))
* People celebrated on rooftops ([Isaiah 22:1](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1-Isa22:2)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1-Isa22:2)[2](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1-Isa22:2))
* Peter prayed on his roof ([Acts 10:9](https://ref.ly/Acts10:9))

With so much activity on rooftops, it is easy to understand the need for the law: “If you build a new house, you are to construct a railing around your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it” ([Deuteronomy 22:8](https://ref.ly/Deut22:8)).

City walls often had battlements at gates and corners to defend against attacks. The Hebrew words for these fortifications are often translated as "towers" ([2 Chronicles 26:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:15); [Zephaniah 1:16](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:16)).
