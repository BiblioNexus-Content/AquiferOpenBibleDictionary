## Expiation (id: 5209)

EXPIATION\*
===========

Atonement, purification, or removal of sin or its guilt. The term occurs in some English translations (such as asv, erv) for “reconciliation” ([Heb 2:17](https://ref.ly/Heb2:17)) or “propitiation” ([Rom 3:25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25); [1 Jn 2:2](https://ref.ly/1John2:2); [4:10](https://ref.ly/1John4:10)). “Expiation” also appears in some English translations of some OT passages ([Nm 35:33](https://ref.ly/Num35:33); [Dt 32:43](https://ref.ly/Deut32:43); [1 Sm 3:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam3:14); [Is 27:9](https://ref.ly/Isa27:9)). The word does not appear in modern Bible translations.

The Hebrew family of words translated by “expiation” speaks fundamentally of a solution for sin, and the most common association is with the idea of atonement. Expiation has to do with removing the blot of sin, and hence the term is related to such words as “forgive,” “purge,” “cleanse,” or “atone.”

All NT references to expiation have to do with the sacrifice of Christ for human sin. In the Bible both expiation and propitiation are part of God’s atoning work. Christ’s sacrifice both propitiates (turns away) the wrath of God and expiates (covers) human sin. God’s redemptive work is both personal, or relational, and objective. When a biblical context concentrates on God’s wrath, propitiation is involved; when human sin is the focus, then redemption provides expiation.
