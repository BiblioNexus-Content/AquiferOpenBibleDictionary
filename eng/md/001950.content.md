## Exorcism, Exorcist (id: 5208)

EXORCISM, EXORCIST
==================

An exorcism is the practice of driving out demons and evil spirits. An exorcist is a person who performs an exorcism.

Many people in the ancient Near East claimed they could drive out or control demons. Some of the miracles of Jesus recorded in the Gospels are exorcisms. But [Acts 19:13](https://ref.ly/Acts19:13) is the only other biblical reference to exorcism among the Jews. But, in [1 Samuel 16:14–23](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14-1Sam16:23), David acted as an exorcist when he played his harp to drive away an evil spirit from King Saul.
