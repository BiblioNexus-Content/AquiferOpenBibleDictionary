## Eliphelet (id: 5020)

ELIPHELET
=========

1. One of the 13 sons of King David born in Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 5:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:16); [1 Chronicles 3:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:8); [14:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:7)).
2. A son Ahasbai. He was one of the mighty men of David ([2 Samuel 23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)). It is possible this Eliphelet was the same person as Eliphal, son of Ur ([1 Chronicles 11:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:35)).

    *See* Eliphal.

3. Another of the sons of David born at Jerusalem. It is possible he was born earlier than \#1 above ([1 Chronicles 3:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:6); [14:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:5)).
4. A son of Eshek and a descendant of King Saul and Jonathan ([1 Chronicles 8:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:39)).
5. One of the three sons of Adonikam who returned with Ezra from Babylon ([Ezra 8:13](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:13)).
6. A son of Hashum whom the scribe Ezra persuaded to divorce his foreign wife during the time after the Jews returned from exile ([Ezra 10:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:33)).
