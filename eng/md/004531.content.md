## Potiphera (id: 7790)

POTIPHERA
=========

Priest of On whose daughter, Asenath, was given to Joseph as his wife by Pharaoh ([Gn 41:45, 50](https://ref.ly/Gen41:45,Gen41:50); [46:20](https://ref.ly/Gen46:20)). On (or Heliopolis) was the center of the sun\-god cult, and Potiphera was likely a high\-ranking priest in the cult. His name, which means “he whom Re \[the son god] has given,” does not appear in Egyptian records until the tenth century BC, a fact employed by those who prefer a late date for the book of Genesis. Yet the name is known from the 15th century (the time of Moses), and its full form may be a modernization of a name common in Joseph’s era (20th century BC).
