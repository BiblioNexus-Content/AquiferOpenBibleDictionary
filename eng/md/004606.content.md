## Puteoli (id: 7867)

PUTEOLI
=======

An Italian seaport town on the Bay of Naples. It was a normal stopping place for people traveling by sea and for cargo going to Rome. After the apostle Paul landed at Rhegium, he stayed with Christians in Puteoli. He was there for seven days before they took him to Rome ([Acts 28:13](https://ref.ly/Acts28:13)). The modern city is called Pozzuoli.
