## Silk (id: 8490)

SILK
====

Fine, delicate thread extracted from the cocoon of the silkworm. Originating in China, silk may have been introduced into Palestine as early as Solomon’s reign (970–930 BC), or perhaps not until the conquests of Alexander the Great (336–323 BC). A fine silken fabric was apparently included in the fashionable attire of Jerusalem ([Ez 16:10–13](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:10-Ezek16:13)). [Revelation 18:12](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12) lists silk as a valuable trade commodity of Babylon (Rome).
