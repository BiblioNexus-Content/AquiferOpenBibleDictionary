## Bagoas (id: 3966)

BAGOAS
======

A steward in charge of the duties of Nebuchadnezzar’s general Holofernes ([Judith 12:11](https://ref.ly/Jdt12:11)). Bagoas found the general’s body after Judith beheaded Holofernes in his tent ([Judith 14:14](https://ref.ly/Jdt14:14-Jdt14:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Jdt14:14-Jdt14:18)[18](https://ref.ly/Jdt14:14-Jdt14:18)). "Bagoas" may have been a Persian title rather than his name.
