## Pashhur, Pashur (id: 7599)

PASHHUR, pashur\*
=================

1\. Forefather of a family of priests who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile ([Ezr 2:38](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:38); [Neh 7:41](https://ref.ly/Neh7:41)). He was perhaps also the son of Malkijah and the grandfather of Adaiah the priest. Adaiah served in the sanctuary during the postexilic period ([1 Chr 9:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:12)). Six of Pashhur’s sons were encouraged by Ezra to divorce their foreign wives ([Ezr 10:22](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:22)).

2\. One of the priests who with Nehemiah set his seal on the covenant of Ezra ([Neh 10:3](https://ref.ly/Neh10:3)).

3\. Immer’s son and the priest and chief officer of the sanctuary during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah (597–586 BC). Frustrated with Jeremiah’s predictions of doom for Jerusalem, Pashhur beat him and had him put in stocks at the temple’s Benjamin Gate. Upon his release, Jeremiah exposed Pashhur’s false prophecies and foretold his exile and death in Babylon ([Jer 20:1–6](https://ref.ly/Jer20:1-Jer20:6)).

4\. Son of Malkijah and perhaps the grandson of King Zedekiah of Judah (597–586 BC; [Jer 21:1](https://ref.ly/Jer21:1); [38:1](https://ref.ly/Jer38:1); cf. [38:6](https://ref.ly/Jer38:6)). The king sent Pashhur, with Zephaniah the priest, to Jeremiah, requesting that he ask the Lord to deal favorably with Judah. It was in his father’s cistern that Jeremiah was imprisoned ([Jer 38:6](https://ref.ly/Jer38:6)).

5\. Father of Gedaliah. Gedaliah—with Shephatiah, Jucal, and Pashhur—opposed Jeremiah and attempted to kill him by imprisoning him in Malkijah’s cistern ([Jer 38:1](https://ref.ly/Jer38:1)).
