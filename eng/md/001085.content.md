## Brimstone (id: 4341)

BRIMSTONE
=========

An old name for the nonmetallic element sulfur, literally “the stone that burns.” Sulfur catches fire at lower temperatures than many other substances. It burns and produces acrid sulfur dioxide fumes. Sulfur occurs naturally in regions that have volcanoes, such as the valley of the Dead Sea. 

In the Bible, “fire and brimstone” are often used to show God's punishment of evil ([Genesis 19:24](https://ref.ly/Gen19:24); [Deuteronomy 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Job 18:15](https://ref.ly/Job18:15); [Psalm 11:6](https://ref.ly/Ps11:6); [Ezekiel 38:22](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:22); and in King James Version, [Luke 17:29](https://ref.ly/Luke17:29); [Revelation 9:17–18](https://ref.ly/Rev9:17-Rev9:18); [14:10](https://ref.ly/Rev14:10); [19:20](https://ref.ly/Rev19:20); [20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10); [21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8)). 

The last time volcanoes erupted in Israel was about 4,000 years ago. Scientists can tell this by measuring how old things are using a method called radiocarbon dating. These powerful volcanic events had a big impact on the people who lived there at that time. They told stories about these events, and these stories were passed down from parents to children over many generations.
