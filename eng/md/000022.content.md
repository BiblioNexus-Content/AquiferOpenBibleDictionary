## Abel-meholah (id: 3279)

ABEL\-MEHOLAH
=============

The birthplace of the prophet Elisha ([1 Kings 19:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:16)). 

Elijah found Elisha in Abel\-meholah where he was plowing. He threw his coat over Elisha’s shoulders, symbolizing God’s call to Elisha to become a prophet ([1 Kings 19:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21)–[21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19-1Kgs19:21)). Earlier, the town is mentioned as one place where the Midianites fled from Gideon’s 300 warriors ([Judges 7:22](https://ref.ly/Judg7:22)). It is also mentioned in a list of districts set up by King Solomon ([1 Kings 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:12)). 

Abel\-meholah is likely modern\-day Khirbet Tell el\-Hilu.
