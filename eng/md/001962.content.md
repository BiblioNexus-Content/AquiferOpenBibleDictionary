## Eznite (id: 5221)

EZNITE
======

The King James Version name for the greatest leader of the mighty men of King David ([2 Samuel 23:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8)). Most scholars consider "Adino the Eznite" the result of a textual corruption or scribal error in the Hebrew text. Most scholars prefer the reading "Jashobeam the Hacmonite." The Berean Standard Bible uses "Josheb\-basshebeth the Tahchemonite" (which is another form of "Jashobeam the Hacmonite").

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 23:8
