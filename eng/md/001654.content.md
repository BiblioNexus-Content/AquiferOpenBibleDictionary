=============

1\. Region of the 12 tribes of Ishmael ([Gn 25:14](https://ref.ly/Gen25:14); [1 Chr 1:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:30)) where there were a number of oases; identified with el\-Jof, modern Dumat el\-Jendel. This place was located about three\-fourths of the way from Damascus to Medina.

2\. Town in the highlands allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 15:52](https://ref.ly/Josh15:52)). Its site is probably identifiable with ed\-Domeh, 10 miles (16\.1 kilometers) southwest of Hebron.
