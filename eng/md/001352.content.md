## Cnidus (id: 4601)

CNIDUS
======

A port city located off the southwest corner of Asia Minor. The apostle Paul's ship passed by this harbor while he was traveling to Italy ([Acts 27:7](https://ref.ly/Acts27:7)). During the second century BC, Jewish people had established a community there ([1 Maccabees 15:23](https://ref.ly/1Macc15:23)). Cnidus was originally built on an island, but today that island is connected to the mainland by a sandbar (a narrow strip of sand).

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 27:7; 1MA 15:23
