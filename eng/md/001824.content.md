## Endive (id: 718557)

Endive
======

Endive (*Cichorium endivia*) is a leafy vegetable with a slightly bitter taste. It is related to chicory and has curly leaves that grow in a loose head. Endive grows well in the Middle East and has been cultivated as a food plant in the region for centuries.

Some scholars suggest that endive may have been among the bitter herbs (*merorim*) eaten by the Israelites during Passover ([Exodus 12:8](https://ref.ly/Exod12:8)), though the Bible does not specify which plants were used. In ancient times, people ate endive both raw and cooked as a green vegetable.
