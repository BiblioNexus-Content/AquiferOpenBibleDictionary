## Endor (id: 5078)

ENDOR
=====

Ancient Canaanite city, four miles (6\.5 kilometers) south of Mt Tabor, assigned to the tribe of Manasseh, though never fully taken by them ([Jos 17:11](https://ref.ly/Josh17:11)). The city witnessed the defeat of Jabin and Sisera by Barak ([Ps 83:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ps83:9-Ps83:10)). Endor is best known as the dwelling place of the witch who was called upon by King Saul ([1 Sm 28:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:7)). On that occasion, Saul disguised himself because his journey to Endor took him near the Philistine army encamped at Shunem.
