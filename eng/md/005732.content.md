## Uz (Person) (id: 8985)

UZ (Person)
===========

1\. Aram’s firstborn son and a descendant of Shem ([Gn 10:23](https://ref.ly/Gen10:23)). In the parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17), Uz is linked directly to Shem without mention of Aram. He is perhaps the forefather of the Aramean nation situated in the Syrian desert regions.

2\. Firstborn son of Abraham’s brother Nahor by his concubine, Milcah ([Gn 22:21](https://ref.ly/Gen22:21)).

3\. Son of Dishan and the grandson of Seir the Horite ([Gn 36:28](https://ref.ly/Gen36:28); [1 Chr 1:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:42)).

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 10:23; GEN 22:21; GEN 36:28; 1CH 1:17; 1CH 1:42
