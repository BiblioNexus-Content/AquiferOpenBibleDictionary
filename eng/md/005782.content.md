WALNUT
======

A walnut is a type of tree that produces round, sticky fruit with an edible nut inside. The "nuts" mentioned in [Song of Solomon 6:11](https://ref.ly/Song6:11) likely refer to the Persian or common walnut (*Juglans regia*). This tree is believed to have originally come from northern Persia, but it also grows wild in many parts of northern India, as far east as China, and as far west as Persia.

During King Solomon's time, the walnut tree was widely grown for its fruit throughout the East. Solomon's "garden of nuts" mentioned in the Bible was possibly part of his large gardens at Etham, which was located 9\.7 kilometers (6 miles) from Jerusalem.
