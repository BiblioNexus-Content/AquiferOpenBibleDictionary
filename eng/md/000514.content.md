## Asaramel (id: 3780)

ASARAMEL
========

A mysterious Hebrew word found in the inscription dedicated to Simon, the ruling high priest of Israel and brother of Judas Maccabeus ([1 Maccabees 14:28](https://ref.ly/1Macc14:28)). 

Possible meanings of *asaramel* include "prince of the people of God" or "court of the people of God." The Syriac version of the Apocrypha drops the "m" to give "Israel"—making the sentence read "in the third year of Simon the great high priest in Israel."

* **Associated Passages:** 1MA 14:28
