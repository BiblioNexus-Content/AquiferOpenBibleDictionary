HANUN
=====

1. A son of Nahash and successor to the Ammonite throne. When King Nahash died, King David of Israel sent messengers to comfort Hanun. They also expressed the continual friendship of David. But Hanun insulted David. He humiliated his messengers and accused them of spying. This action led to war and the defeat of Ammon ([2 Samuel 10:1–14](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:1-2Sam10:14); [11:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1); [12:26–31](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:26-2Sam12:31); [1 Chronicles 19:1–20:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:1-1Chr20:3)).
