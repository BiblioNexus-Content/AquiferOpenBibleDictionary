==========

An alternate King James Version translation for Areopagus. This was the name of a small hill located northwest of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. It was also the name of the council that met there. Mars' Hill was the site where Paul gave his famous speech to the Athenian philosophers ([Acts 17:16–34](https://ref.ly/Acts17:16-Acts17:34)).
