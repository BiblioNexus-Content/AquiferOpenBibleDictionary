## Koa (id: 6636)

KOA
===

People probably living northeast of Babylonia. They are named along with Babylon, Pekod, and Shoa as people who would come against Jerusalem as instruments of God’s judgment on Israel ([Ez 23:23](https://ref.ly/Ezek23:23)). They are perhaps identifiable with the Kutu, mentioned frequently in Assyrian inscriptions.
