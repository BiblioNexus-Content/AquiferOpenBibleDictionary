## Kohath, Kohathites (id: 6637)

KOHATH, KOHATHITES
==================

Kohath was a son of Levi ([Genesis 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11); [Exodus 6:16](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16)). He was the father of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel ([Exodus 6:18](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18); [Numbers 3:19, 27](https://ref.ly/Num3:19,Num3:27); [1 Chronicles 6:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:2)). He was the founder of the Kohathite family of Levites who were responsible for important duties in the tabernacle service ([Numbers 3:31–32](https://ref.ly/Num3:31-Num3:32)). Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were descendants of Kohath ([Exodus 6:18–20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18-Exod6:20); [Numbers 26:59](https://ref.ly/Num26:59); [1 Chronicles 6:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3); [23:13–17](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:13-1Chr23:17)).

The Kohathites Among the Levites
--------------------------------

The tribe of Levi had three divisions named after Levi's sons:

* Gershon,
* Kohath, and
* Merari ([Genesis 46:11](https://ref.ly/Gen46:11); [Exodus 6:16](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16); [Numbers 3:17](https://ref.ly/Num3:17); [1 Chronicles 6:1, 16](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:1,1Chr6:16); [23:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6)).

The Kohathites were an important family among the Levites. The order of their names in [Numbers 4](https://ref.ly/Num4:1-Num4:49), [Joshua 21](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1-Josh21:45), [1 Chronicles 6:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:16), and [2 Chronicles 29:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12) suggests that they were assigned a more honorable position than either Gershon or Merari. References to their position and duties (whether referred to as “the Kohathites,” or “the sons of Kohath”) appear throughout early Hebrew writings ([Exodus 6:18](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18); [Numbers 3:19, 27–30](https://ref.ly/Num3:19,Num3:27-Num3:30); [4:2–4, 15, 18, 34, 37](https://ref.ly/Num4:2-Num4:4,Num4:15,Num4:18,Num4:34,Num4:37); [7:9](https://ref.ly/Num7:9); [10:21](https://ref.ly/Num10:21); [26:57](https://ref.ly/Num26:57); [Joshua 21:4–5, 10, 20, 26](https://ref.ly/Josh21:4-Josh21:5,Josh21:10,Josh21:20,Josh21:26); [1 Chronicles 6:2, 18, 22, 33, 54, 61, 66, 70](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:2,1Chr6:18,1Chr6:22,1Chr6:33,1Chr6:54,1Chr6:61,1Chr6:66,1Chr6:70); [15:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:5); [23:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:12); [2 Chronicles 20:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:19); [29:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12); [34:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:12)).

Duties During the Wilderness Journey
------------------------------------

After leaving Egypt, the Israelites journeyed in the wilderness. The Kohathites camped on the southern side of the tabernacle ([Numbers 3:29](https://ref.ly/Num3:29)). When the tabernacle was moved, they carried the ark and other sacred objects on their shoulders ([Numbers 7:9](https://ref.ly/Num7:9)). When the tabernacle was being built, a count was taken of all male Kohathites who would serve God ([Numbers 3:27–28](https://ref.ly/Num3:27-Num3:28); [4:1–4, 34–37](https://ref.ly/Num4:1-Num4:4,Num4:34-Num4:37)).

Settlement in Canaan
--------------------

After the tribes settled in the land of Canaan, the Kohathites’ service seemed to end. However, God commanded that they be cared for, just like the other Levitical families. The Kohathites were given many cities to live in ([Joshua 21:4–5, 20–26](https://ref.ly/Josh21:4-Josh21:5,Josh21:20-Josh21:26); [1 Chronicles 6:66–70](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:66-1Chr6:70)).

Service During David's Reign
----------------------------

When David became king, he organized the Levites into three divisions ([1 Chronicles 23:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:6)). Heman, who represented the Kohathites, was put in charge of music in God's house ([1 Chronicles 6:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31)). Another group of Kohathites was responsible for preparing the "bread of the presence" each Sabbath ([1 Chronicles 9:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:32)). When David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, he appointed Uriel, a Kohathite, to oversee its transportation ([1 Chronicles 15:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:3-1Chr15:5)).

The Divided Kingdom Period
--------------------------

During the time of the divided kingdom, the Moabites and Ammonites attacked Judah. King Jehoshaphat admitted that Judah could not defeat them and asked for God's help. The Kohathites led the people in songs of praise. They may have also led the army when the king and warriors of Judah faced the invaders ([2 Chronicles 20:19–22](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:19-2Chr20:22)).

Role in Religious Reforms
-------------------------

Two important reform movements occurred in Judah's final years: 

* The first happened during Hezekiah's reign, from 715 to 686 BC ([2 Kings 18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:1-2Kgs18:37); [2 Chronicles 29–30](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:1-2Chr30:27)).
* The second happend during Josiah's reign, from 640 to 609 BC ([2 Kings 22–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:1-2Kgs23:37); [2 Chronicles 34](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:1-2Chr34:33)).

Josiah’s reform reached its peak in 621 BC when the Book of the Law was found. The Kohathites played a key role in both reforms. During Hezekiah's reign, they cleaned the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12-2Chr29:16)). During Josiah's reign, two Kohathites supervised the temple repairs ([2 Chronicles 34:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:12)).

After the Exile
---------------

After the exile in Babylon, the Kohathites are mentioned again. Though we have little information about their importance during this time, they likely served God faithfully despite general spiritual decline. The few whose names are recorded in the Bible were given humble duties. Without evidence to suggest otherwise, we can assume they carried out their responsibilities faithfully ([1 Chronicles 9:19, 31–32](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:19,1Chr9:31-1Chr9:32); [Ezra 2:42](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:42); [Nehemiah 12:25](https://ref.ly/Neh12:25)).
