## Hebron (Place) (id: 5762)

HEBRON (Place)
==============

1. Hebron is an old city that still exists today. It was built on the southern end of a mountain range that runs through the middle of the land of Palestine. In the time of the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), it was called Kiriath\-arba ([Genesis 23:2](https://ref.ly/Gen23:2)). It stood on a hill named El Arbain. The modern city of Hebron now sits across both ridges of the mountain.

 **Location and Geography**
    --------------------------

    Hebron is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Jerusalem. It is less than 3\.2 kilometers (2 miles) from Mamre, where Abraham lived for many years. Hebron is about 914 meters (3,000 feet) above sea level. The land drops down quickly to the east but slopes more gently to the west and south.

    The soil in this area is good for farming. Many fruits (like apples, plums, figs, pomegranates, and apricots), nuts, and vegetables grow well. To the south is the Negev, which has good land for animals to graze. Many springs and wells provide water for the people.

 **Hebron in the Life of Abraham**
    ---------------------------------

    In the Old Testament, Hebron included a nearby area called Mamre. Abraham built an altar to the Lord there after he and Lot went separate ways ([Genesis 13:18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:18)). Abraham also heard there that Lot had been captured ([14:12–16](https://ref.ly/Gen14:12-Gen14:16)). Later, he welcomed three angels there who told him that Sodom and Gomorrah would soon be destroyed (chapter [18](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:33)).

    Abraham’s wife Sarah died in Hebron. Abraham bought the cave of Machpelah to bury her ([Genesis 23:8–9, 17](https://ref.ly/Gen23:8-Gen23:9,Gen23:17); [25:9–10](https://ref.ly/Gen25:9-Gen25:10); [49:29–32](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:32); [50:12–13](https://ref.ly/Gen50:12-Gen50:13)). Today, that cave is inside the modern city. The famous mosque of Haram el\-Khalil was built over it.

 **Hebron in the Time of Moses and Joshua**
    ------------------------------------------

    When the Israelites left Egypt, Moses sent twelve spies to explore the land God had promised them. They started in the south and crossed the central highlands of Palestine. This extended from Kadesh\-barnea through Hebron to Rehob ([Numbers 13:17–21](https://ref.ly/Num13:17-Num13:21)).

    The spies brought back fruit to show how good and productive the land was (verses [23–24](https://ref.ly/Num13:23-Num13:24)). But they also saw very tall people living in Hebron. These people were called the sons of Anak ([Numbers 13:33](https://ref.ly/Num13:33)). Ten of the spies became afraid and gave a bad report.

    Only Caleb and Joshua trusted God. Because of their faith, God promised they would receive land in Canaan. Caleb later received Hebron as his inheritance ([Joshua 14:9, 13](https://ref.ly/Josh14:9,Josh14:13)). The ten spies who doubted God died in a plague ([Numbers 14:36–37](https://ref.ly/Num14:36-Num14:37)).

    Hebron in **Other Events in the Old Testament**
    -----------------------------------------------

    During the time of the judges, the strong man Samson carried the gates of Gaza to Hebron ([Judges 16:3](https://ref.ly/Judg16:3)).

    Later, Saul, Israel's first king, died. Then David became king over Judah and Benjamin in Hebron ([2 Samuel 2:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:1)). David chose Hebron because it was in a central location. It was far from the Philistines in the west and the Amalekites in the south. It was also easy to protect from enemies.

    Hebron was an important city because major trade roads passed through it. But when David became king over all of Israel, he moved his capital to Jerusalem. This change may have upset the people of Hebron.

    Absalom, one of David’s sons, began his rebellion in Hebron. He hoped to become king instead of his father ([2 Samuel 15:7–12](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:7-2Sam15:12)). After Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel was divided. Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, became king of the southern kingdom. He strengthened the city of Hebron because he feared an attack from Egypt on his southern border ([2 Chronicles 11:1–12](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:1-2Chr11:12)). After this, the Old Testament does not mention Hebron again.

2. The King James Version also uses the name Hebron for a different town called Ebron in [Joshua 19:28](https://ref.ly/Josh19:28).
