## Baker (id: 3973)

BAKER
=====

One who prepares food. In biblical times, the baker worked: 

* in the home ([Genesis 19:3](https://ref.ly/Gen19:3)),
* in the public bakery ([Jeremiah 37:21](https://ref.ly/Jer37:21)), and
* in the palaces of kings and nobles ([Genesis 40:1](https://ref.ly/Gen40:1-Gen40:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen40:1-Gen40:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Gen40:1-Gen40:22); [41:10, 13](https://ref.ly/Gen41:10,Gen41:13); [1 Samuel 8:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:13))

They made bread and cakes from the basic staples of oil and flour. The Israelites fleeing from Egypt baked unleavened bread for their journey ([Exodus 12:39](https://ref.ly/Exod12:39)). The bread and cakes were baked in a pan or oven ([Leviticus 2:4](https://ref.ly/Lev2:4); [26:26](https://ref.ly/Lev26:26)). As Israelite society developed, professional bakers worked and formed guilds. Some have argued that Hosea was a baker because of his knowledge of baking techniques ([Hosea 7:4](https://ref.ly/Hos7:4-Hos7:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Hos7:4-Hos7:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Hos7:4-Hos7:8)).
