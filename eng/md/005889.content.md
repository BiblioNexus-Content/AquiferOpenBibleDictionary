## Zamzummim, Zamzummites (id: 9134)

ZAMZUMMIM, ZAMZUMMITES
======================

The Ammonite name for the Rephaim. [Deuteronomy 2:20](https://ref.ly/Deut2:20) describes them as “a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites.” The Zamzummites were forced out of their land by the Ammonites, just as the Horites were forced out by the Edomites and the Avvim by the Caphtorim. The comparison with the Anakim, the Rephaim, and the Emim shows that the Zamzummites were a race of giants. They lived in Transjordan (a region east of the Jordan River). Although their exact origin is unknown, they probably lived in the area near Rabbath\-ammon.
