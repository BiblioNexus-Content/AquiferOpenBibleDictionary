## Ard, Ardite (id: 3724)

ARD, ARDITE
===========

Benjamin's firstborn son Bela had nine sons ([1 Chronicles 8:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:1); [Numbers 26:40](https://ref.ly/Num26:40)). Ard, one of the nine sons, is called Benjamin’s son in the Hebrew sense, meaning descendant ([Genesis 46:21](https://ref.ly/Gen46:21)). He was the founder of the Ardite family, a smaller group within Benjamin’s larger tribe. In the book of 1 Chronicles ([8:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:3)), Ard is called Addar. This difference in spelling is probably because of a mistake made when copying the text long ago.
