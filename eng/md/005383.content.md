## Succoth-Benoth (id: 8642)

SUCCOTH\-BENOTH
===============

Deity and shrine worshiped by Babylonians settled in Samaria by Assyria after the fall of Israel in 722 BC ([2 Kgs 17:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:30)). Various opinions exist as to the specific understanding of Succoth\-benoth. Some suggest that it refers to a place of prostitution honoring a Babylonian deity or to a small structure housing female idols. Others suggest it refers to Sarpanitu, the consort of Marduk (a Babylonian deity), or to Marduk himself.
