## Bamoth, Bamoth-Baal (id: 3987)

BAMOTH, BAMOTH\-BAAL
====================

A town in Moab Joshua gave to the tribe of Reuben ([Joshua 13:17](https://ref.ly/Josh13:17), called Bamoth\-baal). It was one of Israel’s last secure points on the route into Canaan, the Promised Land ([Numbers 21:19](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20)). 

Bamoth\-baal, a mountain or high place, was probably a shrine to the Canaanite god Baal. King Balak of Moab took the prophet Balaam there to try to get him to curse Balak’s enemies, the people of Israel ([Numbers 22:41–23:13](https://ref.ly/Num22:41-Num23:13)).
