## Gentleness (id: 5421)

GENTLENESS
==========

The Old Testament describes gentleness as an attitude of humility or bending low ([2 Samuel 22:36](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:36), King James Version; compare [Psalm 18:35](https://ref.ly/Ps18:35), King James Version). “Gentle” or “gently” can mean courteous and unpretentious ([Proverbs 15:4](https://ref.ly/Prov15:4)), quiet and tender ([Deuteronomy 32:2](https://ref.ly/Deut32:2); [Isaiah 8:6](https://ref.ly/Isa8:6)), or soft and lenient ([2 Samuel 18:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:5); [Job 15:11](https://ref.ly/Job15:11)).

In the New Testament, several words are translated “gentleness,” “gentle,” or “gently.” Different meanings include 

1. mildness, meekness, forbearance ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29); [1 Corinthians 4:21](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:21); [2 Corinthians 10:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:1); [Galatians 5:23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:23); [1 Timothy 6:11](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:11); [1 Peter 3:4, 15](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:4,1Pet3:15)), or a courteous and unassuming attitude ([2 Timothy 2:25](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:25));
2. kindness expressed toward others ([1 Thessalonians 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:7); [2 Timothy 2:24](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:24), King James Version); and
3. fitting, fair, or appropriate in various situations ([1 Timothy 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:3); [Titus 3:2](https://ref.ly/Titus3:2); [1 Peter 2:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:18)).

Church leaders and other believers are instructed to deal gently with those who make mistakes ([Galatians 6:1](https://ref.ly/Gal6:1)), oppose the faith ([2 Timothy 2:25](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:25)), or are ignorant and misguided ([Hebrews 5:2](https://ref.ly/Heb5:2)).
