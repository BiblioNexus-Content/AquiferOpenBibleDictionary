## Othniel (id: 7531)

OTHNIEL
=======

Judge of Israel, mentioned as the son of Kenaz and Caleb’s nephew (or perhaps brother), who delivered Israel from the tyranny of Cushan\-rishathaim, and who earlier distinguished himself by capturing Debir ([Jos 15:15–17](https://ref.ly/Josh15:15-Josh15:17); [Jgs 1:11–13](https://ref.ly/Judg1:11-Judg1:13); [3:8–11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:8-Judg3:11)).

At Caleb’s prompting (promising his daughter Achsah to anyone who could conquer Debir), Othniel took Kiriath\-sepher (Debir) and received Achsah for his wife. When Caleb gave her and her land as a present, Achsah asked for a water source and was given the upper springs and the lower springs ([Jos 15:19](https://ref.ly/Josh15:19); [Jgs 1:15](https://ref.ly/Judg1:15)).

Later, Othniel delivered the Israelites from the oppressive Cushan\-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia (Aram\-naharaim), whom the Israelites had served for eight years on account of their sin ([Jgs 3:7](https://ref.ly/Judg3:7)). When the people cried for relief, the Lord raised up Othniel. Delivering them, he was described as someone that the “Spirit of the Lord came upon” (v [10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10)). The effects of his work as judge lasted for a generation (vv [9–11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:9-Judg3:11)).
