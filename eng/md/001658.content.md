## Dysentery (id: 4909)

DYSENTERY
=========

Dysentery is a sickness that causes diarrhea (loose, watery bowel movements). It is caused by harmful bacteria, protozoa (tiny one\-celled animals called amoeba), or worms that get into food or water.When a person has dysentery, they have painful intestinal cramps and damage to the intestines. Blood and pus appear in their stool (bowel movement).

On the island of Malta, the apostle Paul cmiraculously healed a person who had dysentery (the Greek word is *dysenteria,* [Acts 28:8](https://ref.ly/Acts28:8)). As this verse shows, severe fever comes with acute dysentery. Even today, outbreaks of this disease still affect Malta.

A disease described in the Old Testament was likely amoebic dysentery. In this type, pieces of intestinal tissue can break off day after day ([2 Chronicles 21:14–19](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:14-2Chr21:19)). There is also a less severe form of dysentery that happens when the body can mostly fight against the harmful organism.
