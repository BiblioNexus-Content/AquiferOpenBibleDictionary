## Bloodguilt (id: 4275)

BLOODGUILT
==========

Bloodguilt refers to being responsible for someone's death. In the Bible, this term comes from a Hebrew word that means "blood" or "bloods" ([Exodus 22:2–3](https://ref.ly/Exod22:2-Exod22:3); [Leviticus 17:4](https://ref.ly/Lev17:4); [1 Samuel 25:26, 33](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:26,1Sam25:33); [Hosea 12:14](https://ref.ly/Hos12:14)). When someone killed another person, they were said to have "shed blood" and became guilty of that person's death.

The translation “bloodguiltiness” is only used in [Psalm 51:14](https://ref.ly/Ps51:14). When the Hebrew word is used in its plural form, it usually means someone has killed another person. In its singular form, the word can mean three things:

* Blood itself
* The act of killing someone
* Being guilty of killing someone

Throughout the Bible, we see that killing someone was punished by death. In biblical times, killing often happened by shedding another's blood.

Types of Bloodguilt
-------------------

The first type of bloodguilt was when someone deliberately killed another person on purpose. The Old Testament calls this killing "innocent blood" ([Jonah 1:14](https://ref.ly/Jonah1:14)). The Bible explains what happens when someone kills an innocent person and how they should be punished ([Genesis 9:6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:6); [Deuteronomy 19:11–13](https://ref.ly/Deut19:11-Deut19:13); [2 Kings 24:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:4); [Ezekiel 33:6](https://ref.ly/Ezek33:6)). According to the Bible, if someone commits murder, they cannot pay money to avoid punishment ([Numbers 35:31](https://ref.ly/Num35:31)).

Another type of bloodguilt was when someone killed another person by accident ([Numbers 35:9–28](https://ref.ly/Num35:9-Num35:28), [Deuteronomy 19:4–10](https://ref.ly/Deut19:4-Deut19:10)). In these cases, the person who caused the death could go to special cities called "cities of refuge" to be safe. If they left these cities, they could be killed by a family member of the dead person who was given the right to seek justice. This family member was called an "avenger of blood."

Sometimes, a dead person would be found, and no one knew who killed them. When this happened, the closest town was held responsible for the death. [Deuteronomy 21:1–9](https://ref.ly/Deut21:1-Deut21:9) explains a special ceremony these towns could perform to remove this responsibility.

In ancient Israel, people could become guilty of wrongful killing even when dealing with animals ([Leviticus 17:3–4, 10–11](https://ref.ly/Lev17:3-Lev17:4,Lev17:10-Lev17:11)). If an animal killed someone, the animal would be put to death by stoning ([Exodus 21:28–29](https://ref.ly/Exod21:28-Exod21:29)). 

There were some situations where killing did not lead to guilt:

* Protecting yourself ([Exodus 22:2](https://ref.ly/Exod22:2))
* Carrying out legal executions ([Leviticus 20:9–16](https://ref.ly/Lev20:9-Lev20:16))
* Killing during war ([1 Kings 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:5-1Kgs2:6))

The prophets often used the word for "blood" to talk about the guilt of the entire nation of Israel ([Isaiah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Isa1:15); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4); [Ezekiel 7:23](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:23); [9:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek9:9); [Hosea 1:4](https://ref.ly/Hos1:4); [4:2](https://ref.ly/Hos4:2), in the King James Version; [Micah 3:10](https://ref.ly/Mic3:10); [Habakkuk 2:8, 12, 17](https://ref.ly/Hab2:8,Hab2:12,Hab2:17)). 

Some crimes were considered so serious that they were punished by death, even though they did not involve killing ([Leviticus 20:9–16](https://ref.ly/Lev20:9-Lev20:16); [Ezekiel 18:10–13](https://ref.ly/Ezek18:10-Ezek18:13)). These crimes included: 

* Worshiping false gods
* Worshiping objects as gods (idols)
* Being unfaithful in marriage (adultery)
* Stealing (robbery)
* Being cruel to poor people
* Breaking important promises
* Charging unfair interest on loans

Throughout the Bible, from Genesis ([4:10–12](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:12)) to the Prophets ([Isaiah 26:21](https://ref.ly/Isa26:21); [Ezekiel 24:6–9](https://ref.ly/Ezek24:6-Ezek24:9)) and into the New Testament ([Revelation 6:10](https://ref.ly/Rev6:10)), we learn that God will bring justice and punish those who kill others.
