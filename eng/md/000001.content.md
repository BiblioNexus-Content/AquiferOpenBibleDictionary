## Aaron (id: 3263)

AARON
=====

Moses’s brother and Israel’s first high priest. He was Moses’s representative and helper during Israel's exodus from Egypt. 

Aaron's Early Life and Family
-----------------------------

Aaron was three years older than Moses and was 83 when they first approached the pharaoh ([Exodus 7:7](https://ref.ly/Exod7:7)). Their sister, Miriam ([Numbers 26:59](https://ref.ly/Num26:59)), was the eldest, old enough to send messages when the infant Moses was found by the pharaoh’s daughter ([Exodus 2:1–9](https://ref.ly/Exod2:1-Exod2:9)). Aaron’s parents were Jochebed and Amram, who belonged to the Kohath family within the tribe of Levi ([Exodus 6:18–20](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18-Exod6:20)).

Aaron and his wife, Elisheba, had four sons ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23)), who were to follow him as priests ([Leviticus 1:5](https://ref.ly/Lev1:5)). Two of them, Nadab and Abihu, disobeyed God by performing an improper act while burning incense and were killed by fire as a result ([Leviticus 10:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:5)). The priesthood continued through Aaron’s other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, who also occasionally failed to follow God’s instructions correctly ([Leviticus 10:6–20](https://ref.ly/Lev10:6-Lev10:20)).

Important Events in Aaron’s Life
--------------------------------

### The Exodus from Egypt

Aaron’s importance during the exodus was partly due to his relationship with Moses. When Moses tried to avoid leading Israel because of a speech impediment, God chose Aaron, who was a skilled speaker, to assist him ([Exodus 4:10–16](https://ref.ly/Exod4:10-Exod4:16)).

Aaron was born while the Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt. Moses, raised as an Egyptian by the pharaoh’s daughter, fled to the Midian Desert after killing an Egyptian taskmaster ([Exodus 1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod1:1-Exod2:25)). When God sent Moses back to Egypt to free the Israelites ([Exodus 3–4](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1-Exod4:31)), Aaron was sent to meet him in the desert ([Exodus 4:27](https://ref.ly/Exod4:27)). Since Moses had been away for many years, Aaron connected with Israel’s elders on Moses’ behalf ([Exodus 4:29–31](https://ref.ly/Exod4:29-Exod4:31)). Together, they confronted the pharaoh, delivering God’s command to release the Israelites ([Exodus 5:1](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1)). When the pharaoh made life harder for the Hebrew slaves, God began to demonstrate his power through a series of miracles ([Exodus 5–12](https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod12:51)). Aaron, using a rod (likely a shepherd’s staff), performed the first three miracles. After a plague of gnats (sometimes translated as “lice”) affected all of Egypt, the pharaoh’s magicians admitted defeat, saying, “This is the finger of God!” ([Exodus 8:19](https://ref.ly/Exod8:19)). God then brought further plagues through Moses, leading to the death of all firstborn Egyptian sons. Aaron was with Moses ([Exodus 12:1–28](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:28)) when God revealed the Passover, where the marked homes of the Israelites were spared from death. This event is the origin of the Passover feast still celebrated by Jews today ([Exodus 13:1–16](https://ref.ly/Exod13:1-Exod13:16)).

### Wandering in the Wilderness

After God safely led the Israelites out of Egypt and destroyed the pursuing Egyptians, Aaron helped Moses govern the people during their long journey to the promised land ([Exodus 16:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:6)). In a battle against Amalek’s army, Aaron supported Moses by holding up his weary arms in prayer, ensuring God’s blessing ([Exodus 17:8–16](https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:16)). Although Aaron was always second to Moses, he was recognized as an important leader ([Exodus 18:12](https://ref.ly/Exod18:12)). God called Aaron to join Moses when he gave the law on Mount Sinai ([Exodus 19:24](https://ref.ly/Exod19:24)). Aaron was among the leaders who confirmed God’s laws in the Book of the Covenant ([Exodus 24:1–8](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:8)). He accompanied these leaders partially up the holy mountain and saw a vision of the God of Israel ([Exodus 24:9–10](https://ref.ly/Exod24:9-Exod24:10)). Along with Hur, Aaron was left in charge while Moses was with God on the mountaintop ([Exodus 24:13–14](https://ref.ly/Exod24:13-Exod24:14)).

When Moses was away for over a month, Aaron gave in to the people's demand for an idol. He melted their gold jewelry and made a golden calf ([Exodus 32:1–4](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:4)). (The Israelites may have been influenced by Egypt’s worship of Apis, a fertility god in the form of a bull.) At first, Aaron seemed to think he was doing something acceptable to God ([Exodus 32:5](https://ref.ly/Exod32:5)). Still, things quickly got out of control, leading to a wild, immoral celebration around the idol ([Exodus 32:6](https://ref.ly/Exod32:6)). God was so angry that he considered destroying the people. Still, Moses interceded, reminding God of his promise to Abraham ([Exodus 32:7–14](https://ref.ly/Exod32:7-Exod32:14)). Moses confronted Aaron about idolatry and immorality, but Aaron blamed the people instead of admitting his guilt ([Exodus 32:21–24](https://ref.ly/Exod32:21-Exod32:24)). The idolaters were punished by death ([Exodus 32:25–28](https://ref.ly/Exod32:25-Exod32:28)), and the entire camp was struck by a plague ([Exodus 32:35](https://ref.ly/Exod32:35)). Although Aaron was in great danger, he was spared because Moses prayed for him ([Deuteronomy 9:20](https://ref.ly/Deut9:20)).

In their second year of wandering, Aaron assisted Moses in taking a census ([Numbers 1:1–3, 17–18](https://ref.ly/Num1:1-Num1:3)). Later, Aaron may have become jealous of Moses’s leadership, as both he and Miriam began to speak against their brother, even though Moses was now the most humble man on earth ([Numbers 12:1–4](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:4)). Moses’s prayer turned away God’s anger, but Miriam suffered for her actions ([Numbers 12:5–15](https://ref.ly/Num12:5-Num12:15)). Once again, Aaron was not punished. Aaron also supported Moses against rebellions at Kadesh ([Numbers 14:1–5](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:5)) and later in the wilderness ([Numbers 16](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50)). After a final incident at Meribah, where the Israelites almost rebelled again, God accused Moses and Aaron of not trusting him fully and denied them entry into the promised land ([Numbers 20:1–12](https://ref.ly/Num20:1-Num20:12)). Aaron died at the age of 123 on Mount Hor after Moses removed his priestly clothes and gave them to Aaron’s son Eleazar ([Numbers 20:23–29](https://ref.ly/Num20:23-Num20:29); [33:38–39](https://ref.ly/Num33:38-Num33:39)).
