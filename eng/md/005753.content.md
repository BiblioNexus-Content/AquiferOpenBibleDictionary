## Valley of Rephaim (id: 8002)

VALLEY OF REPHAIM
=================

The Valley of Rephaim is a geographical landmark that formed part of the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The King James Version calls it “the valley of the giants” ([Joshua 15:8](https://ref.ly/Josh15:8); [18:16](https://ref.ly/Josh18:16)). It is a wide valley in the southwestern edges of Jerusalem. 

People thought giants like the Anakim and the Nephilim often visited this valley. During King David's rule, the Philistine armies traveled from the coast to search for David in the Valley of Rephaim. This was after they heard David had been anointed king ([2 Samuel 5:18–22](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:18-2Sam5:22); [1 Chronicles 14:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:9)). 

The Valley of Rephaim connected to the Wadi Serar, which led down to the Philistine coast. This valley was a fertile area where farmers grew grain ([Isaiah 17:5](https://ref.ly/Isa17:5)).
