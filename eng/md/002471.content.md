## Hazar-Addar (id: 5726)

HAZAR\-ADDAR
============

A town, along with Azmon, that marked the southern border of Judah ([Numbers 34:4](https://ref.ly/Num34:4)). It is usually identified with Khirbet el\-Qudeirat near Kadesh\-barnea. 

The parallel passage in [Joshua 15:3–4](https://ref.ly/Josh15:3-Josh15:4) lists four places instead of two:

* Hezron
* Addar
* Karka
* Azmon

Some have suggested that Hazar\-addar and Addar are the same place. Others think they renamed it Hezron to distinguish it from Addar.

* **Associated Passages:** NUM 34:4; JOS 15:3–JOS 15:4
