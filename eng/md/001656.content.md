## Dura, Plain of (id: 4907)

DURA, Plain of
==============

The location in the province of Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar set up the great image of gold, which all his subjects were ordered to worship ([Daniel 3:1](https://ref.ly/Dan3:1)). This exact location is uncertain. It may be situated to the southeast of Babylon or located within the great outer wall of the city itself. The image was likely in a prominent place and an open area used for public gatherings. Since *dur* means "rampart," the phrase should probably be translated as "the plain of the rampart," implying that it would have been near the city wall somewhere.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 3:1
