## Achish (id: 3341)

ACHISH
======

The king of the Philistine city of Gath. Even though David had killed Goliath, Gath’s champion ([1 Samuel 17](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58)), David ran from Saul to Achish’s court. When he realized his mistake, David pretended to be crazy to save his life. This caused Achish to throw him out ([1 Samuel 21:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15)). Later, when David came back to Gath with 600 fighters, Achish gave him the city of Ziklag to use as a base ([1 Samuel 27:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1-1Sam27:7)–[7](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1-1Sam27:7)). Achish thought David’s men were attacking the Israelites. Instead, they were destroying Philistine towns ([1 Samuel 27:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8-1Sam27:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8-1Sam27:12)).
