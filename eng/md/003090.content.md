## Jeshurun (id: 6346)

JESHURUN
========

A poetical name for Israel. It is possibly derived from the Hebrew root meaning “upright.” According to many scholars, it is a diminutive of Israel. A diminutive is a version of a word or an ending added to a word to make it smaller, such as "little Israel." 

The name Jeshurun is used in [Deuteronomy 32:15](https://ref.ly/Deut32:15) and [33:5, 26](https://ref.ly/Deut33:5,Deut33:26). In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the word is not translated as a proper name but as an adjective, “beloved.” In [Isaiah 44:2,](https://ref.ly/Isa44:2)Jacob is described as “Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.” This links the name with the idea of election or choosing. 

In [Deuteronomy 33:5](https://ref.ly/Deut33:5)Israel is reminded that “the LORD became king in Jeshurun." Verse [26](https://ref.ly/Deut33:26) says, “There is none like the God of Jeshurun." If we follow the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament), there is a link with the term “beloved” used of Christ in [Matthew 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17), [Mark 1:11](https://ref.ly/Mark1:11), and [Ephesians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Eph1:6), and of the church in [Colossians 3:12](https://ref.ly/Col3:12), [1 Thessalonians 1:4](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:4), [2 Thessalonians 2:13](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13), and [Jude 1:1](https://ref.ly/Jude1:1).
