## Issachar, Tribe of (id: 6097)

ISSACHAR, Tribe of
==================

The Israelite tribe descended from Jacob's son, Issachar. Their land is defined in [Joshua 19:17](https://ref.ly/Josh19:17-Josh19:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:17-Josh19:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Josh19:17-Josh19:23), though not in great detail. 

The Territory of the Tribe of Issachar
--------------------------------------

Its eastern border ends at the Jordan. The area can be located through the towns listed in their land, namely: 

* Jezreel
* Chesulloth
* Shunem
* Anaharath
* Kishion
* Remeth
* En\-gannim

We are more certain about the locations of some of these cities than others. 

* Jezreel and En\-gannim are in the southeast corner of the valley of Jezreel.
* Chesulloth is just west of Mount Tabor.
* Shunem is at the foot of the hill of Moreh.

The northern border can be identified through the southern boundaries of Zebulun and Naphtali ([Joshua 19:10](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:12,Josh19:33-Josh19:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:12)[12, 33](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:12,Josh19:33-Josh19:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:12)[34](https://ref.ly/Josh19:10-Josh19:12,Josh19:33-Josh19:34)). The three tribes of Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulun, all met at Mount Tabor. 

On the southern border, some major towns were not conquered in Joshua’s time ([Judges 1:27](https://ref.ly/Judg1:27)), and were taken from Issachar and given to Manasseh ([Joshua 17:11](https://ref.ly/Josh17:11)): 

* Beth\-shan
* Ibleam
* Tanaach

Conflicts among the local tribes occurred in this area (as recorded on a stele of Seti I at Beth\-shan). The area is called “Mount Yarunta,” after Yarmuth ([Joshua 21:29](https://ref.ly/Josh21:29)). Issachar was located on the rich plateau stretching east of Mount Tabor and the hill of Moreh and north of the Beth\-shan Valley.
