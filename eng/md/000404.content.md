## Apollophanes (id: 3666)

APOLLOPHANES
============

A Syrian warrior during the period between the Old Testament and New Testament. The army of Judas Maccabeus killed Apollophanes at a fortress named Gazara ([2 Maccabees 10:37](https://ref.ly/2Macc10:37)). Apollophanes's death happened after an important battle. In the battle, the Jewish army relied on the Lord for victory. However, the Syrians fought from violent uncontrolled anger ([2 Maccabees 10:24–31](https://ref.ly/2Macc10:24-2Macc10:31)).
