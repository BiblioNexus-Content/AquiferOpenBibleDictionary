## Adria (id: 3400)

ADRIA
=====

The Adriatic Sea is an arm of the Mediterranean Sea between Italy, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, and Croatia on the east. The apostle Paul experienced a violent storm on the Adriatic Sea for 14 days ([Acts 27:27](https://ref.ly/Acts27:27)). Other ancient texts also speak about the violence of the Adriatic Sea. The Jewish historian Josephus was shipwrecked in the Adriatic in AD 64, and the Greek poet Homer talked about these violent storms in his writings.
