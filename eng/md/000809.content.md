## Behistun Inscription (id: 4080)

BEHISTUN INSCRIPTION
====================

A large rock carving from ancient Persia carved into the slope of Mount Behistun. It is written in three languages: 

* Old Persian
* Elamite
* Akkadian

It is a record of the accomplishments of Darius I, king of the Persian Empire. It provides the key to understanding the cuneiform script (an ancient writing system using wedge\-shaped marks) in which several of these ancient languages were written.
