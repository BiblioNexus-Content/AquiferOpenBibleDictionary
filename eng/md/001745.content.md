## Eliakim (id: 4996)

ELIAKIM
=======

1. Hilkiah’s son and a royal officer in the household and court of King Hezekiah ([2 Kings 18:18, 26, 37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18,2Kgs18:26,2Kgs18:37)). His position had become more important since Solomon was king ([1 Kings 4:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:2-1Kgs4:6)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:2-1Kgs4:6)[6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:2-1Kgs4:6)), so he was second only to the king. As such, Eliakim could do anything as the king’s representative.
2. When Sennacherib of Assyria moved against Jerusalem in 701 BC, Eliakim was a messenger for the king who spoke with the Assyrian officers for King Hezekiah ([2 Kings 18:18, 26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18,2Kgs18:26)). He was also sent by Hezekiah in sackcloth to Isaiah to ask for prayer on Jerusalem’s behalf ([2 Kings 19:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:1-2Kgs19:5)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:1-2Kgs19:5)[5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:1-2Kgs19:5)).
3. King Josiah’s second son. When Eliakim was made king of Judah by Pharaoh Neco, his name was changed to Jehoiakim ([2 Kings 23:34](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:34); [2 Chronicles 36:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr36:4)).

    *See* Jehoiakim.

4. One of the priests who helped dedicate the Jerusalem wall after it was rebuilt by Zerubbabel ([Nehemiah 12:41](https://ref.ly/Neh12:41)).
5. Abiud’s son in Matthew’s family list of Jesus ([Matthew 1:13](https://ref.ly/Matt1:13)).

6. Melea’s son in Luke’s family list of Jesus ([Luke 3:30](https://ref.ly/Luke3:30)).
