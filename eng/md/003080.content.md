## Jeshanah (id: 6336)

JESHANAH
========

Border city in the hill country of Ephraim that King Abijah of Judah (913–910 BC) seized from King Jeroboam I (930–909 BC) and the northern kingdom during a civil war ([2 Chr 13:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:19)). The Greek and Syriac reading of “Jeshanah” as one of the towns between which Samuel erected the Ebenezer stone may be preferred to the Hebrew “Shen” in [1 Samuel 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:12). Its location is perhaps near Burj el\-Isaneh, four miles (6\.4 kilometers) north of Bethel.
