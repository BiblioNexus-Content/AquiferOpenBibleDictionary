## Buzzard (id: 4373)

BUZZARD
=======

A buzzard (*Buteo vulgaris* or *Buteo ferox*) is a hawk\-like bird that soars in the air. It looks like the kite but has a straight tail, not a split one.

Some Bible versions lists buzzards among unclean birds ([Deuteronomy 14:13](https://ref.ly/Deut14:13)). Other Bible translations use different names, such as “kite” (Berean Standard Bible) or “glede” (King James Version). In the parallel list in [Leviticus 11](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:47), some translations use “kite” or “vulture” instead of “buzzard.” Because of this, it is not certain whether the buzzard is actually named in the Bible. The bird is, however, common in Israel.

Like other large birds that soar, the buzzard has sharp eyesight. [Job 28:7](https://ref.ly/Job28:7) mentions a bird with this quality, but translations differ on whether it was a falcon, eagle, or vulture. A buzzard may follow its prey for hours and can see a dead animal from far away.

The long\-legged buzzard is somewhat larger than the common buzzard. It lives in Israel, western Asia, and Syria.
