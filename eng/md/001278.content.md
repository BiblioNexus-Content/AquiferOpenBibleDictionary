CHINNERETH, CHINNEROTH
======================

1. A fortified town in the territory of the tribe of Naphtali ([Joshua 19:35](https://ref.ly/Josh19:35)). An Egyptian list of towns from the time of Thutmose III in the 15th century BC also names it. The site isidentified as Tell el\-’Oreimeh on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Archaeologists believe people lived in the town from about 2000 to 900 BC.
2. A district in Naphtali’s territory that included the town mentioned above (\#1\). Ben\-hadad, king of Aram (Syria), conquered it in the early ninth century BC during the reign of Baasha, king of northern Israel ([1 Kings 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20)).
3. An early name for the Sea of Galilee ([Numbers 34:11](https://ref.ly/Num34:11); [Deuteronomy 3:17](https://ref.ly/Deut3:17); [Joshua 11:2](https://ref.ly/Josh11:2); [12:3](https://ref.ly/Josh12:3); [13:27](https://ref.ly/Josh13:27)). It is uncertain whether the city was named after the sea or the sea after the city. The name means “lyres,” possibly because the sea is shaped like a lyre (a stringed instrument similar to a harp). In New Testament times, the name became Gennesaret ([Luke 5:1](https://ref.ly/Luke5:1)).
