## Gazelle (id: 5384)

GAZELLE
=======

A gazelle is a type of antelope (deer\-like animal) that lives in Asia and Africa. These animals are known for their speed and graceful movement.

Palestine and Israel is home to two types of gazelles. Both male and female gazelles have curved horns. The dorcas gazelle *(Gazella dorcas)* is pale fawn and up to 56 centimeters (22 inches) tall. Meanwhile, the Arabian gazelle *(Gazella arabica)* is darker and can reach 63\.5 centimeters (25 inches).

Gazelles are common in the holy land's deserts and steppes, especially in the Negev Desert. Typically, herds have five to ten animals. However, some migrate in large groups during fall to find new feeding grounds at lower elevations. They eat plants. Being shy, they appoint guards to watch for danger.

In biblical times the gazelle was probably the game animal most hunted by the Jews ([Proverbs 6:5](https://ref.ly/Prov6:5); [Isaiah 13:14](https://ref.ly/Isa13:14)). Pharaoh Tutankhamen hunted gazelles and ostriches. People brought gazelles to King Solomon's palace for food ([1 Kings 4:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:23)). 

Gazelles were not easy to catch because they ran quickly ([2 Samuel 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:18); [1 Chronicles 12:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:8); [Proverbs 6:5](https://ref.ly/Prov6:5)). They were even faster than the deer. They were trapped in different ways: caught in nets, pushed into pits, or herded into narrow valleys to be shot. The Bedouin hunt gazelles with falcons and dogs. The falcon strikes the gazelle's head, injuring it. This makes it easier for the dogs to catch up.

The gazelle is referred to in Song of Solomon where it is an image of feminine beauty ([Song of Solomon 2:9, 17](https://ref.ly/Song2:9,Song2:17); [4:5](https://ref.ly/Song4:5); [7:3](https://ref.ly/Song7:3); [8:14](https://ref.ly/Song8:14)).
