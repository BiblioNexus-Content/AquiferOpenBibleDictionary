## Milcah (id: 7133)

MILCAH
======

1\. Daughter of Haran and half sister of Nahor who became Nahor’s wife ([Gn 11:29](https://ref.ly/Gen11:29)). She bore Nahor eight sons ([22:20–23](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:23)). Through her son Bethuel she was the grandmother of Rebekah ([24:15–47](https://ref.ly/Gen24:15-Gen24:47)).

2\. One of the five daughters of Zelophehad. Because Zelophehad had no sons, his daughters petitioned Moses to allow them to receive their father’s inheritance in west Manasseh after their father’s death ([Nm 26:33](https://ref.ly/Num26:33); [27:1–11](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11); [36:5–13](https://ref.ly/Num36:5-Num36:13); [Jos 17:3–4](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3-Josh17:4)).
