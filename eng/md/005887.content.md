## Zalmonah (id: 9130)

ZALMONAH
========

A place where the Israelites camped during their journey. They came to this place after they left Mount Hor ([Numbers 33:41–42](https://ref.ly/Num33:41-Num33:42)). The name "Zalmonah" suggests that it might have been a dark or shady valley. This valley probably led up to the high flat land of Edom
