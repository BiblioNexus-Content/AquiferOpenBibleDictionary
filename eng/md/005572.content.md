## Three Taverns (id: 8823)

THREE TAVERNS
=============

A place where the Christians came to meet the apostle Paul when he arrived in Rome ([Acts 28:15](https://ref.ly/Acts28:15)). It was on the Appian Way located at milepost 33 (49\.1 kilometers or 30\.5 English miles). The Forum of Appius is 16\.1 kilometers (ten miles) further south along the same road. Three Taverns was near modern Cisterna. It was at an important crossing between the Appian Way and the road from Antium to Norba. So it became a common meeting place for travelers.

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 28:15
