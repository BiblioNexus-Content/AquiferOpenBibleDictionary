## Girzites (id: 5477)

GIRZITES
========

People living in southwest Canaan who were raided by David when at Ziklag ([1 Sm 27:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8), kjv “Gezrites”). The Hebrew text has girzi*,* while the marginal variant transposes two consonants to read gizri*,* “Gezrites.” The Greek version follows the Hebrew marginal variant. The confusion of the name is obviously early. If “Gerzites” is the original, they could have been a Canaanite tribe living in the Mt Gerizim area. If it was “Gezrites” originally, the people could have migrated from Gezer. They are otherwise unmentioned in the OT.
