## Rathamin (id: 7951)

RATHAMIN\*
==========

A territory transferred from the dominion of Samaria to Judah by Demetrius of Syria. A letter from Demetrius to his adjutant Lasthenes authorizing the transfer is mentioned in [1 Maccabees 11:34](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:34). The word is sometimes translated Ramathaim (nlt), the birthplace of Samuel and home of Elkanah and Hannah ([1 Sm 1:1, 19](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1,1Sam1:19); [2:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:19)). In that case, it figures prominently in OT history, for there Saul first made acquaintance with Samuel ([9:6, 10](https://ref.ly/1Sam9:6,1Sam9:10)), there Samuel retreated after his last break with Saul, and there Samuel’s grave is located ([25:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:1)). Textual variants Armathaim (tev “Arimathea”) and Ramatha are partly explained by the transposition of *m* and *th* in the Septuagint version. Two modern sites are recommended for the ancient district: Beit Rime, 13 miles (20\.9 kilometers) east and north of Lydda, and Ramallah, 8 miles (12\.9 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.
