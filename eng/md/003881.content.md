## Millet (id: 7140)

MILLET
======

A small\-seeded grass that people grow for food and for its leaves ([Ezekiel 4:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:9)). People originally grew millet (*Panicum miliaceum*) in Europe and Asia for its edible seeds.

Millet seeds are the smallest of all grass seeds that people grow for food, but the plants produce many seeds. Millet is a grass that lives for one year and usually grows no taller than 0\.6 meter (2 feet).

The small seeds of millet are used on cakes. In some cases, people eat the seeds uncooked.
