## Millennium (id: 7139)

MILLENNIUM
==========

A biblical term meaning “a thousand years.” It comes from an old Latin word. In the Bible, the millennium refers to a time when Christ will rule for 1,000 years.

The main teaching about the millennium appears in [Revelation 20:1–6\.](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:6) In this passage, the Greek word for thousand is used five times. The idea of a thousand\-year reign may also be supported by passages such as [Acts 3:19–21](https://ref.ly/Acts3:19-Acts3:21) and [1 Corinthians 15:23–26\.](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23-1Cor15:26) These passages speak of a future time when Christ will rule and restore all things. This doctrine is directly taught only in the book of Revelation. People have different ideas about what this means and how important it is. There are three main interpretations: amillennial, postmillenial, and premillenial.

Amillenial
----------

The first way of understanding the millennium is the amillennial view. The prefix 'a\-' means 'no,' so amillennial means there is no literal thousand\-year period when Christ will rule on earth. Instead, this view sees the millennium as symbolic. People who hold this view believe:

* The millennium is happening now, in our present time
* Satan's power is already limited (this is what 'bound' means in Revelation)
* The church is experiencing the millennium right now in a spiritual way

However, there are some problems with this view. One major issue is how it explains the two resurrections mentioned in [Revelation 20](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:15). The same Greek word is used for "resurrection" in twice:

* The first in [verse 4](https://ref.ly/Rev20:4) is interpreted as a spiritual resurrection
* The second in [verse 5](https://ref.ly/Rev20:5) as a physical resurrection

The passage itself does not indicate that the writer intended a difference of meaning. Hence, the amillennial position is often accused of improperly spiritualizing the meaning of the Bible.

Another perspective on the *a*millennial position is that the thousand\-year reign of Christ is a symbolic expression of Christ’s unlimited rule. This is opposed to an actual reign of 1,000 years.

Postmillennial
--------------

The second view is *post*millennial. The prefix 'post\-' means 'after,' so postmillennial means Christ will return after the thousand\-year period. People who hold this view believe:

* The spread of Christianity will create the millennium
* As more people become Christians, the world will gradually become more peaceful
* This peaceful time could be:

    + Something that will happen in the future, or
        + Something that began when Jesus first came and is still continuing

The key idea is that most people in the world will become Christians before Christ returns. All versions of this view agree on one main point: Christ does not come back until *after* the thousand years are finished. It is not the second coming of Christ and his visible presence that brings about the millennium. Instead, the spread of Christianity creates this peaceful time.

Premillennial
-------------

The third way of understanding the millennium is called the premillennial view. The prefix 'pre\-' means 'before,' so premillennial means Christ will return before the thousand\-year period begins. People who hold this view believe:

* Christ will come back to earth first
* Then he will start his thousand\-year rule
* People will be able to see him and his power
* He will bring peace to the earth during this time

The premillennialist interprets visions of the book of Revelation in order, one after another. First is the return of Christ in chapter [19](https://ref.ly/Rev19:1-Rev19:21). This is followed by the binding of Satan for a thousand years and the first resurrection of the saints to reign with Christ for a thousand years ([20:1–6](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:6)). This is followed by a release of Satan and the battle of those deceived against Christ and his people and the final destruction of the devil (verses [7–10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev20:10)). The deceived are referred to as "Gog and Magog." Next is the account of the final judgment and the last resurrection (verses [11–15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:11-Rev20:15)). This is followed by the new heaven and new earth (chapter [21](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:27)).

The premillennialist strongly affirms that this order of events means the millennium reign of Christ is a real, future event following Christ’s return. Premillennialists do not believe in any of the variations of amillennialism or postmillennialism that see the millennium in the present church age before Christ returns or even in the future before Christ comes again. Premillennialists claim these views do not properly explain the order of events in Revelation.

In addition to the literary argument, there is the theological point that the premillennial position places the real triumph of Christ within history. That is, the victory that the church believes was accomplished through Christ’s death on the cross will be made visible to the world and the forces of evil at Christ’s return and reign on earth. This is not faith in a merely spiritual or heavenly triumph, but faith that God will genuinely intervene in the course of the world to bring justice and peace.

However, the premillennial view has one big problem. the Bible does not answer some important questions, such as:

* How will Christ and his followers who have been raised from death rule the earth?
* How will they interact with regular people who are still living normal human lives?
* How can this happen before God creates the new heaven and new earth?

Because these questions remain unanswered, many Bible scholars prefer to understand [Revelation 20](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:15) using either the amillennial or postmillennial view.
