## Zeboiim (id: 9159)

ZEBOIIM
=======

One of the “cities of the plain” that was destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah ([Dt 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); [Hos 11:8](https://ref.ly/Hos11:8)). Zeboiim is first mentioned, with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Admah, as one of the Canaanite cities in the “table of nations” in [Genesis 10:19](https://ref.ly/Gen10:19). It later appears confederated with the same states (including Zoar) in the battle against Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim ([Gn 14:2, 8](https://ref.ly/Gen14:2,Gen14:8)).
