======

The nickname of Jonathan, one of Judas Maccabeus’s four brothers ([1 Maccabees 9:28–13:30](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:28-1Macc13:30)). As with the other Maccabean nicknames, the meaning of the word *apphus* is uncertain ([1 Maccabees 2:2–6](https://ref.ly/1Macc2:2-1Macc2:6)). “Favorite,” “beloved,” or “desired” have been suggested as translations. *See* Jonathan \#16.
