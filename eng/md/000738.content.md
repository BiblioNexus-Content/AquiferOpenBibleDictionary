## Bar-Jona (id: 4007)

BAR\-JONA
=========

The Aramaic form of Simon Peter’s last name, meaning “son of Jonah” ([Matthew 16:17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17)). Another verson of the name appears in [John 1:42](https://ref.ly/John1:42) and [21:15](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)[–](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)[17](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17), where the best Greek texts have “son of John” rather than “son of Jona\[s].” 

*See* Simon Peter.
