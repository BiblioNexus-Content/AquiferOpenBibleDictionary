## Pollux (id: 7769)

POLLUX
======

A figure from Greek mythology who was the son of Zeus and the twin brother of Castor. Together, they were known as the Dioscuri, meaning "sons of Zeus." The Dioscuri were considered protectors of sailors and ships. In [Acts 28:11](https://ref.ly/Acts28:11), Paul and his companions sailed from Malta from Alexandria. The ship had the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux. Many ancient ships had carved figureheads, often believed to bring good luck and protection during voyages.
