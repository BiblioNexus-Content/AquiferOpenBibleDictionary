ELAM (Person)
=============

1\. Firstborn son of Shem and a grandson of Noah ([Gn 10:22](https://ref.ly/Gen10:22); [1 Chr 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17)).

2\. Benjamite and the son of Shashak ([1 Chr 8:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:24)).

3\. Korahite Levite and the fifth son of Kore from the house of Asaph ([1 Chr 26:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:3)).
