## Biziothiah, Bizjothjah (id: 4264)

BIZIOTHIAH, BIZJOTHJAH\*
========================

Listed in [Joshua 15:28](https://ref.ly/Josh15:28) (kjv “Bizjothjah”) as a city in the Negev Desert area of Judah. The Greek OT, called the Septuagint, has “and her daughters,” which would mean that this was not a specific place but rather the cluster of villages surrounding Hazar\-shual and Beersheba. Such a translation is possible with a slight adjustment to the Hebrew text. It is difficult to say how the Hebrew text originally read.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 15:28
