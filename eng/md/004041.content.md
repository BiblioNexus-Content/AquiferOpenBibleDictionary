## Naomi (id: 7300)

NAOMI
=====

The wife of Elimelech. She was the mother of Mahlon and Chilion. Naomi was a member of the tribe of Judah. She lived in Bethlehem during the time when judges ruled Israel. The book of Ruth tells her story. 

Because of a severe famine in Canaan, Naomi resettled with her family in the land of Moab, east of the Dead Sea ([Ruth 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:1-Ruth1:2)). Her husband and two sons died in Moab (verses [3–5](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:3-Ruth1:5)). So, Naomi returned to Bethlehem with Ruth, her Moabitess daughter\-in\-law (verses [8–22](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:8-Ruth1:22)). When she reunited with her friends, she told them not to call her "Naomi," which means “pleasant.” Instead, she told them to call her, "Mara," which means “bitter.” Naomi said, “I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty” (verses [20–21](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:20-Ruth1:21)). Her family troubles were later resolved when Ruth married Boaz. Boaz was a close relative of Elimelech (chapters [2–4](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:1-Ruth4:22)).
