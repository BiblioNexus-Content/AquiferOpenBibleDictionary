## Assos (id: 3837)

ASSOS
=====

Assos was a seaport in Mysia, part of the Roman province of Asia (Minor). The apostle Paul and Luke reunited in Assos after Paul traveled overland from Troas, as described in [Acts 20:13](https://ref.ly/Acts20:13-Acts20:14)–[14](https://ref.ly/Acts20:13-Acts20:14). The Roman writer Pliny noted that the kings of Pergamum founded the town, which was originally named Apollonia. Assos was located on top and along the terraced sides of an extinct volcanic cone that rises 770 feet or 234\.6 meters. The Greek philosopher Aristotle lived there for several years. It was also where Cleanthes was born. Cleanthes was a Stoic poet mentioned by Paul in [Acts 17:28](https://ref.ly/Acts17:28). Today Assos is known as Behram Kevi.
