## Golan (id: 5503)

GOLAN
=====

City and a district in the territory given to Manasseh in Bashan. It was the northernmost city of refuge east of the Jordan River ([Dt 4:43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:43); [Jos 20:8](https://ref.ly/Josh20:8)), given to the Levite family of Gershon ([Jos 21:27](https://ref.ly/Josh21:27); [1 Chr 6:71](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:71)). Of uncertain identification, it was known to Josephus as a fertile area, and to Eusebius as a village. The best current suggestion places it at Sehem el\-Jolan, east of the river el\-’Allan.
