## Ethan (id: 5170)

ETHAN
=====

1\. Wise man comparable to Solomon ([1 Kgs 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31)) and probably the author of [Psalm 89](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52). It is uncertain whether he was a contemporary of Solomon.

2\. Descendant of Judah and son of Zerah ([1 Chr 2:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6)), perhaps the same as \#1 above. However, they are ascribed different fathers in the two passages.

3\. Son of Zimmah, a descendant of Gershon, Levi’s oldest son ([1 Chr 6:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:42)).

4\. Descendant of Levi through his son Merari, and the son of Kishi ([1 Chr 6:44](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:44)) or Kushaiah ([15:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17)). He was one of three outstanding musicians, along with Heman and Asaph, appointed by David (vv [16–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:16-1Chr15:19)). It was probably this Ethan whose name is ascribed in the title to [Psalm 39](https://ref.ly/Ps39:1-Ps39:13) (as “Jeduthun,” which he is called in [1 Chr 16:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:41); [25:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1)) as “chief musician”; it is likely that he composed the music for the psalm.
