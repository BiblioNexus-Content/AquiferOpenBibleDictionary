## The Caesars (id: 4380)

THE CAESARS
===========

The Caesars were the rulers of the Roman Empire. The name *Caesar* was first the family name of Julius Caesar, who lived 100–44 BC.

Later Roman leaders used *Caesar* as a title, even if they were not from Julius Caesar’s family. This is where the words *Kaiser* (in German), *Keizer* (in Dutch), and *Czar* (in Russian) come from.

The Bible mentions Caesar Augustus ([Luke 2:1](https://ref.ly/Luke2:1)) and Tiberius Caesar ([Luke 3:1](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1)). In the book of Acts, the title *Caesar* refers to Nero ([Acts 25:11–12, 21](https://ref.ly/Acts25:11-Acts25:12,Acts25:21); [26:32](https://ref.ly/Acts26:32); [27:24](https://ref.ly/Acts27:24); [28:19](https://ref.ly/Acts28:19)). During the time of the New Testament, 12 Caesars ruled. Six of them were part of the original Caesar family.
