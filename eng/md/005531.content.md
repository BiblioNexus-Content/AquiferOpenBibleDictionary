## Teresh (id: 8792)

TERESH
======

Teresh was one of two trusted officials (called chamberlains) who guarded King Ahasuerus's (also called Xerxes) private rooms. Teresh and the other guard made a plan to kill the king. However, Mordecai found out about this plan and told Queen Esther. She warned the king, and the two guards were put to death ([Esther 2:21–23](https://ref.ly/Esth2:21-Esth2:23); [6:2](https://ref.ly/Esth6:2)).
