## Merchant (id: 7061)

MERCHANT
========

A person who buys and sells commodities for profit. The barter system of trade gave way in time to a system where professional merchants facilitated the exchange of goods. At first, it was for payment in silver pieces ([Gn 23:16](https://ref.ly/Gen23:16)) and then in coinage or some other medium of exchange. Merchants operated locally and internationally with Arameans ([1 Kgs 20:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:34); [Ez 27:16–18](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:16-Ezek27:18)), Canaanites and Phoenicians ([Is 23:2, 8](https://ref.ly/Isa23:2,Isa23:8)), Assyrians ([Na 3:16](https://ref.ly/Nah3:16)), Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. Some merchants traveled afar ([Neh 13:16–20](https://ref.ly/Neh13:16-Neh13:20)). Desert peoples with caravans traded their wares in many lands ([Ez 27:15, 20–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:15,Ezek27:20-Ezek27:23); [38:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:13)). They operated in bazaars and set up shops for trade ([1 Kgs 20:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:34); [Neh 3:31](https://ref.ly/Neh3:31); [13:19–20](https://ref.ly/Neh13:19-Neh13:20)). Commodities were held in storehouses ([Gn 41:49](https://ref.ly/Gen41:49); [1 Kgs 9:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:19)). The sons of Jacob traded in Egypt ([Gn 43:11](https://ref.ly/Gen43:11)). In Solomon’s day, trade greatly expanded ([1 Kgs 9:26–27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:27); [10:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:28)). During the exile, Jews became involved in merchant activity in Babylonia, and many never returned to Palestine. In Jerusalem the merchants helped Nehemiah to rebuild the wall ([Neh 3:31–32](https://ref.ly/Neh3:31-Neh3:32)).
