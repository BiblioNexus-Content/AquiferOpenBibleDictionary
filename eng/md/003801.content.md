## Merathaim (id: 7060)

MERATHAIM
=========

Name that Jeremiah uses in reference to God’s judgment upon Babylon ([Jer 50:21](https://ref.ly/Jer50:21)). Though it means “double rebellion” or “twofold rebel,” it is a wordplay on the name for southern Babylonia, Marratu. Thus, God says, “Go up against the land, Two\-fold rebel . . . and utterly destroy it!”

* **Associated Passages:** JER 50:21
