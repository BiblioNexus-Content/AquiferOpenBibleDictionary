## Coriander (id: 4649)

CORIANDER
=========

An annual herb native to Palestine. The fragrant seeds of this plant are mentioned twice in the description of manna ([Exodus 16:31](https://ref.ly/Exod16:31); [Numbers 11:7](https://ref.ly/Num11:7)). The references in these verses clearly refer to the common coriander plant (*Coriandrum sativum*).

Coriander was commonly found growing alongside grain in cultivated fields throughout Israel and the surrounding areas. It also grows wild in Egypt. Ancient people used it both as a food flavoring and as medicine. The leaves have a strong, pleasant smell and are used in soups and for flavoring puddings, curries, and wines.

Arabs still use coriander as a spice today. In the Bible, it is mentioned only when describing manna, which was said to look like coriander seeds in size, shape, and color.
