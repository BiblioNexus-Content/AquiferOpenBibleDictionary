## Tongues of Fire (id: 8892)

TONGUES OF FIRE
===============

A phrase in [Acts 2:3](https://ref.ly/Acts2:3), describing the physical appearance of the Spirit. The tongues of fire seem to fulfill John the Baptist’s prediction that the Coming One would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire ([Matthew 3:11](https://ref.ly/Matt3:11); [Luke 3:16](https://ref.ly/Luke3:16)). The disciples are described as being filled with the Holy Spirit, fulfilling the Old Testament promise that John the Baptist and Jesus repeated about the baptism of the Spirit.
