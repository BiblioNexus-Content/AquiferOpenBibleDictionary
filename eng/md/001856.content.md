## Ephphatha (id: 5110)

EPHPHATHA
=========

An Aramaic word meaning "be opened." Mark writes it using Greek letters to show the sounds of the Aramaic word. Jesus said this when he healed a man who could not hear or speak ([Mark 7:34](https://ref.ly/Mark7:34)). Jesus was not trying to create a magical formula. Mark simply records the exact words Jesus used.
