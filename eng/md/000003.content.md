## Aaronites (id: 3261)

AARONITES
=========

The collective name for the priests who descended from Aaron through his sons Eleazar and Ithamar. Aaron was the brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel. 

The term is used twice in the King James Version to refer to the 3,700 men who supported David against Saul ([1 Chronicles 12:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:27)) and of whom Zadok later became leader ([1 Chronicles 27:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:17)). Both “house of Aaron” ([Psalms 115:10, 12](https://ref.ly/Ps115:10,Ps115:12); [118:3](https://ref.ly/Ps118:3); [135:19](https://ref.ly/Ps135:19)) and “Aaron” ([1 Chronicles 27:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:17)) are used to refer to the Aaronites.
