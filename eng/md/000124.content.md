## Admah (id: 3384)

ADMAH
=====

A city associated with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Zeboiim ([Genesis 10:19](https://ref.ly/Gen10:19); [14:2, 8](https://ref.ly/Gen14:2,Gen14:8)). It was probably destroyed in God’s judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah ([Deuteronomy 29:23](https://ref.ly/Deut29:23); it is not mentioned in [Genesis 19:28](https://ref.ly/Gen19:28-Gen19:29)–[29](https://ref.ly/Gen19:28-Gen19:29)). A recent survey of the area east and south of the Dead Sea has revealed five early Bronze Age (around 3300 to 2000 BC) cities that probably are the five “cities of the plain” mentioned in Genesis. Each city was located beside the valley of a river that flowed into the plain around the Dead Sea.
