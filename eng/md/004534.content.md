## Pottage (id: 7793)

POTTAGE\*
=========

Red\-colored vegetable stew commonly served in the OT ([Hg 2:12](https://ref.ly/Hag2:12)). Pottage was made of lentils, herbs, onions, and sometimes meat. Its aroma proved strong enough to shift a birthright from Esau to Jacob ([Gn 25:29–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:29-Gen25:34)). Elisha’s disciples relished its nourishment ([2 Kgs 4:38–41](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:38-2Kgs4:41)).
