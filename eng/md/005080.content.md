## Shelumiel (id: 8343)

SHELUMIEL
=========

Shelumiel was a Simeonite (a person from the tribe of Simeon). He was the son of Zurishaddai and one of the leaders who helped Moses count the people of Israel in the wilderness ([Numbers 1:6](https://ref.ly/Num1:6); [2:12](https://ref.ly/Num2:12); [7:36, 41](https://ref.ly/Num7:36,Num7:41); [10:19](https://ref.ly/Num10:19)). According to the book of Judith, which is not in the Hebrew Bible but is accepted by some Christian groups, Shelumiel is an ancestor of Judith ([Judith 8:1](https://ref.ly/Jdt8:1), where his name is spelled Salamiel and his father's name is spelled Sarasadai).
