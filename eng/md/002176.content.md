## Geruth-kimham (id: 5432)

GERUTH\-KIMHAM
==============

A piece of land near Bethlehem. It means “the lodging place of Kimham.” Geruth\-kimham was possibly given to Kimham because of the service that his father, Barzillai the Gileadite, had provided to King David ([2 Samuel 19:31–40](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:31-2Sam19:40); [1 Kings 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:7)). 

After Jerusalem fell in 586 BC, Geruth\-kimham became the camp where Johanan son of Kareah and his men stayed. This is where they prepared to escape to Egypt ([Jeremiah 41:17](https://ref.ly/Jer41:17)). 

*See* Kimham.
