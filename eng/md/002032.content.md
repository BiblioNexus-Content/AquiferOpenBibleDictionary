## Fords of the Jordan (id: 5288)

FORDS OF THE JORDAN
===================

The fords of Jordan were shallow places in the Jordan River where people and animals could walk across.

Many important people in the Old Testament crossed the Jordan River at one of its fords (shallow crossing places). These included:

* Jacob ([Genesis 32:10](https://ref.ly/Gen32:10)),
* Gideon ([Judges 8:4](https://ref.ly/Judg8:4)),
* King David ([2 Samuel 10:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:17); [17:22](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:22)),
* David's son Absalom ([2 Samuel 17:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:24)), and
* Abner and his men ([2 Samuel 2:29](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:29))

Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River on dry ground during the flood season. This was a miracle from God ([Joshua 3:15–16](https://ref.ly/Josh3:15-Josh3:16)). 

Jesus also crossed the Jordan River several times during his travels between Galilee and Jerusalem.

There were two main fords of the Jordan. The first was at Jericho ([Joshua 2:7](https://ref.ly/Josh2:7); [Judges 3:28](https://ref.ly/Judg3:28); [2 Samuel 19:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:15)). The second was at Bethabara, where John baptized ([John 1:28](https://ref.ly/John1:28)). 

At certain times and places, the Jordan was too deep to cross easily. This happened after snow melted in the Lebanon Mountains or near the Dead Sea. In these places, the river could be about 30\.5 meters (100 feet) wide and 1\.5 to 3 meters (5 to 10 feet) deep ([Joshua 3:15](https://ref.ly/Josh3:15)).
