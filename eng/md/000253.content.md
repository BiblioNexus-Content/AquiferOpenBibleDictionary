## Alliance (id: 3513)

ALLIANCE
========

An alliance is a close association of powerful individuals or nations for a common goal. Such alliances were confirmed in various ways:

* giving gifts
* making oaths
* paying money to the family when marrying (dowries)
* arranging marriages between important families
* making special agreements (covenants)

In the time of the patriarchs (when Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived), Israelites made alliances with foreign nations easily. Abraham made alliances with:

* three Amorites: Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner ([Genesis 14:13, 24](https://ref.ly/Gen14:13,Gen14:24))
* Abimelech, king of Gerar ([Genesis 21:22–34](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:34)).

Isaac, Abraham's son, also allied with Abimelech ([Genesis 26:26](https://ref.ly/Gen26:26-Gen26:31)–[31](https://ref.ly/Gen26:26-Gen26:31)). 

Later, Moses did not allow alliances with the Canaanites for religious reasons ([Exodus 23:31](https://ref.ly/Exod23:31-Exod23:33)–[33](https://ref.ly/Exod23:31-Exod23:33); [34:12](https://ref.ly/Exod34:12); [Deuteronomy 7:1](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4)–[4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4)). In the time of the judges, the Israelites were reminded of this command ([Judges 2:1](https://ref.ly/Judg2:1-Judg2:3)–[3](https://ref.ly/Judg2:1-Judg2:3)). But, [Joshua 9](https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:27) tells how Israel was tricked into an alliance with the Gibeonites.

During the monarchy, many kings made alliances and intermarried with foreigners: 

* David (before he was king of all Israel) agreed with Achish, king of Gath, to fight with the Philistines against Saul’s army ([1 Samuel 27:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:1); [28:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:2)).
* Solomon made trade alliances with Hiram of Tyre ([1 Kings 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs5:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs5:18); [9:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28)–[28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28)).
* Solomon also made trade alliances with the king of Egypt ([1 Kings 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:16)).
* Asa allied with Ben\-hadad, king of Syria ([1 Kings 15:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:18-1Kgs15:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:18-1Kgs15:20)).
* King Ahab allied with Jehoshaphat to fight Syria ([1 Kings 22:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:4)–[4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:4); [2 Chronicles 18:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:1-2Chr18:13)–[13](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:1-2Chr18:13)).
* King Pekah allied with Rezin, king of Syria, to fight Ahaz, king of Judah ([Isaiah 7:1](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:1-Isa7:9)).
* King Ahaz allied with Tiglath\-pileser, king of Assyria, to fight against Pekah and Rezin ([2 Kings 16:7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:7-2Kgs16:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:7-2Kgs16:9)).
* King Zedekiah allied with Egypt to fight against the Babylonians ([2 Kings 24:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:20); [Ezra 17:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek17:1-Ezek17:21)–[21](https://ref.ly/Ezek17:1-Ezek17:21)).

These alliances often brought foreign religions into Jerusalem ([2 Kings 16:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:10-2Kgs16:18)). This led the prophets to criticize them ([Hosea 8:8](https://ref.ly/Hos8:8-Hos8:10)–[10](https://ref.ly/Hos8:8-Hos8:10); [Isaiah 30:1](https://ref.ly/Isa30:1-Isa30:3,Isa30:15-Isa30:16)–[3, 15](https://ref.ly/Isa30:1-Isa30:3,Isa30:15-Isa30:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Isa30:1-Isa30:3,Isa30:15-Isa30:16); [Jeremiah 2:18](https://ref.ly/Jer2:18)).
