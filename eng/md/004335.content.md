## Partridge (id: 7593)

PARTRIDGE
=========

A partridge is the most common game bird in the Holy Land. It looks like a chicken but has a slimmer body and a longer tail.

Two kinds of partridge live in the Holy Land:

1. **Sand partridge** (*Ammoperdix heyi*) — Found near the Dead Sea, in the Jordan River valley, and in the Sinai Desert. It is medium\-sized with yellow feet. The male has sandy\-buff feathers with brown bars on the upper tail and a chestnut and white underside. The female is grayish buff.
2. **Chukar partridge** (*Alectoris graeca*) — Similar to the French partridge of Europe. It is about 40\.6 centimeters (16 inches) long and has bright, colorful feathers.

### Patridges in the Bible

The partridge was hunted for food. People caught it by chasing until it was too tired to run ([1 Samuel 26:20](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:20)). It could also be caught with snares ([Psalm 91:3](https://ref.ly/Ps91:3)) or by hunters hiding in a shelter. Although it can run quickly and jump up steep cliffs, it is still easy to catch when tired. Its brownish\-green feathers help it hide among bushes.

The bird lays many eggs, which keeps it from becoming extinct despite heavy hunting. Sometimes the female lays two groups of eggs: one for herself and one for the male to keep warm. This may explain the saying in [Jeremiah 17:11](https://ref.ly/Jer17:11) about a bird gathering eggs it did not hatch. This was used as a picture of someone taking credit for work they did not do.
