## Appeal (id: 3674)

APPEAL
======

A legal term for requesting a higher court to review a decision by a lower court. Old Testament law made no provision for appeals. In the New Testament, the apostle Paul appealed to Caesar for a hearing after his arrest in Jerusalem ([Acts 25:11](https://ref.ly/Acts25:11)). Because Paul was a Roman citizen, he could have his case removed from the Jewish courts. Paul feared an unfair trial in the Jewish courts.
