## Archaeology and the Bible (id: 3713)

ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE BIBLE
=========================

The study of ancient human history through the recovery and examination of physical remains. Biblical archaeology focuses on objects and structures found in the Near East (Middle East) which relate to the Bible. These remains include buried artifacts (ancient objects), ruins, and monuments. Some of these artifacts have inscriptions (writings) in ancient languages. Scholars need to carefully study these inscriptions to understand them. Other items include everyday objects like broken pottery, burnt wood, toys, and tools. All these pieces must be understood within the historical period from which they came.

**Discoveries in Archaeology**
------------------------------

Many significant archaeological finds have happened by accident. For example, a farmer in Syria uncovered the ancient city of Ugarit while plowing. A Bedouin searching for a lost goat discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls in a cave. In 1887, an Egyptian woman found the Amarna tablets while looking for bricks to use as fertilizer. In 1945, Egyptians hunting for bird manure near Nag Hammadi found important Gnostic manuscripts. However, accidental discoveries are no replacement for careful, systematic archaeological surveys.

Today, archaeologists carefully survey potential sites using aerial photography and electronic equipment. These methods are used to detect underground objects. Artifacts are dated based on the layer of earth they were found in and other methods, like radiocarbon dating. The goal is to create a timeline that accurately reflects the history of the artifacts and the site itself.

**The Role of Archaeology in Understanding the Bible**
------------------------------------------------------

Archaeologists and scholars treat these artifacts as real, factual evidence of past human life. Although there can be different opinions on how to interpret them, these objects are still direct witnesses to history. It is important to understand these objects from an earlier time as evidence and not manipulate them to fit personal theories about history, culture, or religion. Near Eastern archaeology helps us understand the Bible by providing objective background information. 

For example, if an artifact with writing is dated to around 3000 BC, it shows that writing existed at that time. This means early authors of the Old Testament could have written down the stories credited to them. Archaeological discoveries have shown that Moses, the traditional author of the first five books of the Bible, could have written in:

* Egyptian hieroglyphics,
* Babylonian cuneiform, and
* Canaanite dialects, including Hebrew.

Any theory about the Bible that ignores such evidence is likely to be incorrect.

Archaeology and Daily Life
--------------------------

Archaeology has revealed much about the daily life of ancient people. Excavations (digging sites) show that during the Neolithic period (late Stone Age), people lived in simple huts made of interwoven sticks. Some of these huts were decorated inside. Middle\-class homes in Ur during Abram's time were elegant, even by modern standards. The ruins of palaces in places like Knossos, Persepolis, Mari, and Qantir reveal their former magnificence. Weaving is one of the oldest human crafts and was practiced even in ancient times. The techniques used to weave oriental rugs originated in Mesopotamia. Pottery, both plain and decorated, was another ancient craft.

### Social Customs

Archaeology has also clarified social customs mentioned in the Bible. For example, Abram having a child with Hagar, his wife's servant, followed local customs at Nuzi and was not considered immoral. Adoption practices, like Abram’s adoption of Eliezer ([Genesis 15:2–4](https://ref.ly/Gen15:2-Gen15:4)), are better understood through texts from Nuzi. These texts describe childless couples adopting a servant who would inherit their estate. These adoptees would become the firstborn, though the birth of a natural child could remove those rights. Texts from Nuzi, Ugarit, and Alalakh also explain the rights of firstborn sons and how those rights could be traded, as seen in [Genesis](https://ref.ly/Gen48:13-Gen48:22) [25:31–34](https://ref.ly/Gen25:31-Gen25:34). 

### Trade

Work and trades in the biblical period have been illustrated through various archaeological finds. For example, a type of picture called a "tableau" from Beni Hasan (made around 1900 BC) shows Semites bringing goods to Egypt, possibly as metalworkers. Other sources depict activities like: 

* Hunting
* Fishing
* Brick making
* Agriculture
* Pottery making

These sources also provide information about how people dressed, with examples from Egyptian paintings from 500 years later with Semites giving gifts to the Pharaoh, showing clothing styles that remained unchanged for centuries. The Israelites, however, were forbidden from making representations of human beings or God.

### Potsherds

The most common daily artifacts are potsherds (broken pieces of pottery), which were often used as writing materials. For example, the “Lachish letters,” a series of military letters written from a northern outpost from 587 BC, were written on potsherds. Even in New Testament times, potsherds were still used for writing. This was because they were more durable than papyrus and more convenient than wax tablets. Pens, palettes, and ink have all been found in Egypt. The ink that was used to write the Dead Sea Scrolls has been recovered from Qumran.

### Games

Archaeological finds also include games and toys from ancient times. For instance, a painting from a tomb at Beni Hasan (around 2000 BC) shows Egyptian girls playing a ball game. A relief from a temple at Thebes shows Ramses III playing checkers. Egyptian children of a later period played a game using pebbles that was perhaps an early version of backgammon. In Megiddo, an ivory gaming board with holes, presumably for pegs, was found from around 1200 BC. Children’s toys from the Near East were not so different than modern ones. Toys have been found like: 

* Whistles
* Balls
* Model chariots
* Animals on wheels

Adult sports like wrestling, archery, and running were also depicted in Egyptian tomb paintings.

### Embalming

Embalming is a process that preserves dead bodies. The embalming of Jacob and Joseph, as described in [Genesis 50:2–3, 26](https://ref.ly/Gen50:2-Gen50:3), was a long\-standing Egyptian custom. Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah with his ancestors. Although the site is known, it cannot be excavated because it is a sacred place for Arabs. An inscription associated with an ancient Hebrew burial site was found in 1931 on the Mount of Olives. It reads, “Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah king of Judah—do not open.” This inscription dates from the time of Christ. It suggests that the tomb of King Uzziah was found during excavations in Jerusalem and that his remains were moved to another site.

Archaeologists have also shown that the stone door covering the entrance to Christ’s tomb was common from around 100 BC to AD 100, which matches the Gospel accounts.

Archaeology and Religion
------------------------

Archaeology has provided insights into the nature of biblical religion and worship. Long before Abram left Ur to follow the one true God, non\-Jewish Mesopotamians worshiped various gods. They recognized these gods as sky gods. This background makes the Hebrew patriarchs' relationship with their God more understandable. The worship of pagan gods in portable shrines is illustrated in a relief of Ramses II, showing a divine tent in the Egyptian camp. Phoenician writings from the seventh century BC also mention a portable shrine pulled by oxen. This background supports the idea that the Israelite wilderness tabernacle was not a later invention.

Archaeology has confirmed the tradition of singers participating in worship before the Babylonian exile. For centuries, Palestinians were known for their musical abilities. Tablets from Ras Shamra in Ugarit contain religious poetry similar to the Hebrew psalms. Solomon’s temple, built by Phoenician workmen, followed a plan (see [1 Kings 6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:1-1Kgs6:38)) similar to an eighth\-century BC chapel found at Tel Tainat in Syria. The Wailing Wall in Jerusalem is thought to include stones from Nehemiah’s time. But, no traces of Solomon’s foundations have been found in the city. Pieces of masonry from Herod’s temple, destroyed in AD 70, have been found. These pieces provide valuable information about the temple’s structure. Although many synagogues existed in Palestine during Christ’s time, few remains have been found.

Archaeology and Warfare
-----------------------

Archaeology has greatly enhanced our understanding of ancient warfare, a significant biblical theme. Ancient Near Eastern people viewed war as a conflict between the gods of opposing nations. Military service was considered sacred, and soldiers were highly respected. God, as the Lord of hosts, was seen as the commander of the Hebrew army. He could command the complete destruction of a city, called "the ban," as in the case of Jericho ([Joshua 6:17, 24](https://ref.ly/Josh6:17)). War followed understood rules. If a city was threatened, its inhabitants could surrender and have their lives spared, though their property would be taken. If they resisted, they risked total destruction. Warfare tactics included: 

* Frontal assaults (direct attacks)
* Spies
* Ambushes
* Patrols

Sometimes battles were decided by single combat, as in the story of David and Goliath ([1 Samuel 17:38–54](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:38-1Sam17:54)).

Ancient armor and weapons are widely depicted in reliefs and monuments. 

* A golden helmet from Ur is an outstanding example of Sumerian military gear. In contrast, smaller Hittite helmets are depicted on a tomb wall at Karnak. At first, only leaders in Israelite armies wore metal helmets (see [1 Samuel 17:38](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:38)). But, by the time of the Seleucid Empire, all Hebrew soldiers had bronze helmets ([1 Maccabees 6:35](https://ref.ly/1Macc6:35)). Roman soldiers commonly wore either leather or bronze helmets.
* The Hebrews used two types of shields: a large one for infantry and a smaller one for archers ([2 Chronicles 14:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr14:8)). These shields were generally made of wood and leather, though some were made of bronze.
* Coats of scale armor, such as in [Jeremiah 46:4](https://ref.ly/Jer46:4), were used in the Near East from at least the fifteenth century BC, as shown by discoveries at Alalakh and Ugarit.
* Swords and spears, essential parts of Hebrew weaponry, came in various shapes and sizes. Furnaces for making swords were found at Gerar, and Bronze Age daggers have been recovered from Lachish and Megiddo.
* The compound Asiatic bow was an improvement on the simpler bows depicted in earlier times. Arrowheads dating between 1300 and 900 BC, inscribed with names, suggest the existence of companies of archers (see [Isaiah 21:17](https://ref.ly/Isa21:17)).

Very little is said in the New Testament about military equipment.

Archaeology and Literature
--------------------------

Archaeological discoveries have provided parallels to many types of biblical literature. For example, excavators at Ras Shamra found poetic and prose tablets. These tablets had grammatical and literary forms similar to those in the Hebrew psalms. It is now clear that detailed law codes, like those in the Pentateuch, existed before Moses's time. 

Fragmentary Sumerian codes from around the nineteenth century BC, such as the Law Code of Hammurabi, are similar in form and style to the Mosaic Law. The Law Code of Hammurabi explained the principles of justice in 300 sections. The code was an attempt to control society through law and order. Its style is interesting; it begins with a prologue in the poem, followed by the legal section, and ends with an epilogue in non\-poetic language. This three\-part pattern also appears in the book of Job, as well as in more modern writings.

The covenant structure of [Exodus 20:1–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:17) and its fuller form in Deuteronomy is similar to the structure of second\-millennium BC Hittite vassal treaties from Boghazkôy. The treaties were written in a standard pattern, which can also be seen in various Old Testament passages like 

* [Exodus 20:1–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:17)
* [Leviticus 18:1–30](https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30)
* [Deuteronomy 1:1–31:30](https://ref.ly/Deut1:1-Deut31:30)
* [Jeremiah 31:31–37](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:37)

Genesis contains elements that are similar to Mesopotamian literary traditions. For example, the repeated phrase “these are the generations of.” This phrase and the surrounding text are used as "colophons" (publication information in modern books) on Mesopotamian tablets. This phrase, along with family lists from sites like Nuzi, suggests that the short style of early Genesis is similar to Sumerian historical writing.

Hebrew wisdom literature, like Proverbs, also finds parallels in other ancient texts. For instance, the "Instruction of Amenemope," an Egyptian text, shares similarities with [Proverbs 22:17–24:22](https://ref.ly/Prov22:17-Prov24:22), though scholars debate whether one text influenced the other or if they both derive from an earlier, lost source.

The form of letters from the ancient world is used often in the Bible (for example, [2 Samuel 11](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27); [1 Kings 21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29); [2 Kings 5:10, 20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:10); [Ezra 4:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:6-Ezra4:7); [Nehemiah 2:7](https://ref.ly/Neh2:7)). This form was used in Egyptian papyri, like the Zenon documents, and in Greek writings, such as Plato's letters. Plato's *Seventh Letter* from around 354 BC is similar to the letters of the apostle Paul. Plato's *Seventh Letter* also attempts to correct misunderstandings about his teaching. Paul's letters are also sometimes similar to the personal nature of some Egyptian letters, particularly Philemon.

Archaeology and Language
------------------------

The recovery of ancient languages through archaeology has helped us understand the Old Testament. Many expressions in the Old Testament have been found to be originally Sumerian or Akkadian. For example, the phrase "the heavens and the earth" in [Genesis 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1). In Sumerian, the expression is *an\-ki,* meaning "universe." This phrase uses two opposite terms to express totality, a literary device also seen in [Revelation 22:13](https://ref.ly/Rev22:13).

Ugaritic and Eblaic are both West Semitic dialects closely related to Hebrew. These dialects have provided insights into obscure Hebrew poetic language, revealing that it preserves ancient Canaanite expressions. Aramaic is another Northwest Semitic language. The study of Aramaic has also clarified the language used in certain parts of the Old Testament, such as the books of Ezra and Daniel. These were written in imperial Aramaic. The Elephantine papyri from the fifth and fourth centuries BC support the early dating of these texts.

The New Testament was written in koine, or "common" Greek, the common language of the Near East and the Roman Empire. New Testament Greek often contains underlying Semitic expressions, which, if unrecognized, can lead to mistranslations.

Significance for Biblical Studies
---------------------------------

Archaeological discoveries have significantly expanded our knowledge of the ancient world. The have allowed us to see the people of the Bible as real historical figures. These individuals lived in times of both stress and cultural achievement. They were not legendary figures. They struggled with life’s problems. They sometimes received visions of God as all\-powerful and all\-holy, guiding them and their nations and helping them to accomplish his purpose in history. 

Archaeology demonstrates that the Hebrews should be studied within the broader context of the ancient Near East as part of a large culture that included diverse peoples like the Sumerians and Aegeans. This study must be approached objectively. We must use evidence to understand biblical events and life. While there may be occasional conflicts between archaeological interpretations and biblical evidence, these are rare and tend to diminish as more information is uncovered.

Archaeology cannot prove or disprove the spiritual truths of Scripture. But, it does validate Hebrew history. It makes clear many previously uncertain terms and traditions in both the Old and New Testaments. In doing so, archaeology provides a solid historical background for the prophecies that lead to the life of Jesus Christ.
