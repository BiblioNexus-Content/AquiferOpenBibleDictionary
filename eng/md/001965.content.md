## Ezrahite (id: 5223)

EZRAHITE
========

Word occurring only three times in the OT. Twice it is used as a title for Ethan ([1 Kgs 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31); [Ps 89 title](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1)) and once as a name given to Heman ([Ps 88 title](https://ref.ly/Ps88:1)). It is no longer thought to be a family name, but instead signifies a member of a pre\-Israelite family.

* **Associated Passages:** 1KI 4:31; PSA 88:1; PSA 89:1
