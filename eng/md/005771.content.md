## Viper (id: 9016)

VIPER
=====

A viper is a poisonous snake with long, hollow fangs for injecting venom.

In the Bible, the word “viper” can refer to the same kinds of venomous snakes as the word “adder.” Different Bible translations sometimes use one term or the other for the same snake ([Matthew 3:7](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7); [Acts 28:3](https://ref.ly/Acts28:3)). These snakes can deliver a dangerous or deadly bite.

*See* Adder; *see also* Animals (Adder).
