## Boanerges (id: 4279)

BOANERGES
=========

A name meaning “sons of thunder.” Jesus gave this name to James and John, Zebedee’s sons ([Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17)). The reason for the name is unclear. The name may have referred to 

* the unpredictable personalities of the two brothers ([Luke 9:54](https://ref.ly/Luke9:54)),
* to their possible revolutionary past as Zealots (a violent group in Judea who opposed being ruled by the Roman Empire), or even
* to a style of speaking that was like thunder.

*See also* James (Person); John, The Apostle.
