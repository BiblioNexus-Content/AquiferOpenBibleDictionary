## Belmain (id: 4091)

BELMAIN
=======

A Samaritan city that was a camp for Nebuchadnezzar’s invading general, Holofernes, against the Jews ([Judith 4:1](https://ref.ly/Jdt4:1-Jdt4:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Jdt4:1-Jdt4:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Jdt4:1-Jdt4:4)). It was probably the same as Balbaim ([Judith 7:3](https://ref.ly/Jdt7:3)), Balamon ([8:3](https://ref.ly/Jdt8:3)), and perhaps Bebai ([15:4](https://ref.ly/Jdt15:4)).
