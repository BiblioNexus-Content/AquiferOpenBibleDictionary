## Lebaoth (id: 6707)

LEBAOTH
=======

Town in the Negev of Judah ([Jos 15:32](https://ref.ly/Josh15:32)) occupied by the tribe of Simeon under the name Beth\-lebaoth ([19:6](https://ref.ly/Josh19:6)). The parallel list of Simeonite towns has Beth\-biri in this place ([1 Chr 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:31)). The element beth*,* “house of,” is undoubtedly original, denoting a place of worship of the goddess of the lions *(*lebaoth*)*; Beth\-biri might be another place or just a textual variant typical of the list in 1 Chronicles.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 15:32; JOS 19:6; 1CH 4:31
