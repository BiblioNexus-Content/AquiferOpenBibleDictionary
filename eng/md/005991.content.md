## Ziph (Place) (id: 9240)

ZIPH (Place)
============

1\. One of the cities in the extreme south assigned to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 15:24](https://ref.ly/Josh15:24)).

2\. One of the cities in the hill country belonging to Judah’s tribe ([Jos 15:55](https://ref.ly/Josh15:55)), mentioned with Maon, Carmel, Jezreel, and most prominently with Hebron (cf. [1 Chr 2:42](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:42)). Ziph has been identified with a site three miles (4\.8 kilometers) south of Hebron. The surrounding wilderness region is probably the “wilderness of Ziph” where David hid from Saul ([1 Sm 23:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:14-1Sam23:15); [26:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:2)). The Ziphites who betrayed David to Saul were residents of this city and the surrounding region ([1 Sm 23:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam23:19); [26:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:1); [Ps 54 title](https://ref.ly/Ps54:1)). Ziph is later mentioned as one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam ([2 Chr 11:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:8)).
