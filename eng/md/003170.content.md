## Jonadab (id: 6427)

JONADAB
=======

1. A nephew of King David. He was the son of Shimeah, brother of King David. Jonadab was a friend of Amnon, the son of David. He created a plan that helped Amnon force himself on his half\-sister Tamar ([2 Samuel 13:3–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:3-2Sam13:5)). Later, Absalom, who was Tamar's brother, took revenge by killing Amnon.
2. A son of Recab. He was a descendant of the Kenites ([1 Chronicles 2:55](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:55)). He started a religious group called the Recabites, who chose to live as nomads (people who move from place to place rather than settling in one area). Jonadab supported Jehu when Jehu violently removed the family of King Ahab from power ([2 Kings 10:15, 23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:15,2Kgs10:23)).
