## Abron (id: 3323)

ABRON
=====

A stream or dry riverbed mentioned in the Book of Judith. It was located on the path that Nebuchadnezzar’s general, Holofernes, took during his attack ([Judith 2:24](https://ref.ly/Jdt2:24)). 

Some early scholars thought it with the biblical Jabbok ([Numbers 21:24](https://ref.ly/Num21:24)). Others called it the Cherbon, maybe because of a misreading of Habor ([2 Kings 17:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:6)).
