## Syrophoenicia (id: 8686)

SYROPHOENICIA
=============

The homeland of the Greek woman who pleaded with Jesus near Tyre and Sidon to cast a demon out of her daughter ([Mark 7:26](https://ref.ly/Mark7:26)). The region of Phoenicia was located in the Roman province of Syria. 

It is unclear why Mark specified Syrophoenicia as her homeland. Another North African province was called Libyaphoenicia. This could have been a potential cause of confusion. In a parallel passage, this woman is identified as a Canaanite. Phoenicians referred to themselves as Canaanites ([Matthew 15:22](https://ref.ly/Matt15:22)).
