## Bar-Jesus (id: 4006)

BAR\-JESUS
==========

A Jewish sorcerer and a “false prophet” (someone who falsely claimed to speak for God). He worked with the governor of Paphos on the island of Cyprus ([Acts 13:6](https://ref.ly/Acts13:6)). When the governor, Sergius Paulus, became interested in the message of Paul and Barnabas, Bar\-Jesus tried to turn him away from their teachings. Paul confronted Bar\-Jesus, calling him a "son of the devil" and predicting that he would be temporarily blinded as a punishment from God. Immediately, Bar\-Jesus was struck with blindness ([Acts 13:7](https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Acts13:7-Acts13:12)). The governor seems to have converted to Christianity.

At that time, many people who easily believed in supernatural events were influenced by those who claimed to have special powers like Bar\-Jesus (compare [Acts 8:9](https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Acts8:9-Acts8:11)). The term "sorcerer" used for him meant more than just magician; it often referred to a wise man whose knowledge was thought to be greater than that of most others in society.

Bar\-Jesus was also known by his Greek name, Elymas ([Acts 13:8](https://ref.ly/Acts13:8)). Jewish people with connections to Greek culture often adopted Greek names. Some believe that Elymas comes from an Aramaic word for "strong" and an Arabic word for "wise," which can also mean "magician."
