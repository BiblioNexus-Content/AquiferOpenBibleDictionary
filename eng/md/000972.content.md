## Bilhah (Person) (id: 4242)

BILHAH (Person)
===============

Servant given by Laban to his daughter Rachel when she married Jacob ([Gn 29:29](https://ref.ly/Gen29:29)). Realizing her own childlessness, Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband as a concubine and accepted their two sons as her own, naming them Dan and Naphtali ([30:3–8](https://ref.ly/Gen30:3-Gen30:8); [35:25](https://ref.ly/Gen35:25); [46:25](https://ref.ly/Gen46:25)). Archaeological investigation has confirmed the custom of a barren wife’s providing a concubine to guarantee children to her husband. Such an arrangement is mentioned in marriage contract documents dug up at Nuzi and dated from about the same time as the [Genesis 29](https://ref.ly/Gen29:1-Gen29:35) events. Jacob’s son Reuben was later guilty of incest with Bilhah ([35:22](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22)).
