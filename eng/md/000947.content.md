## Beulah (id: 4218)

BEULAH
======

A Hebrew word used once in the King James Version as a proper name for Jerusalem, suggesting a promise of blessing for the people of God ([Isaiah 62:4](https://ref.ly/Isa62:4)). The word means “married” and was used symbolically by the prophet Isaiah to describe what God’s special relationship would be to his restored people. The same theme recurs in New Testament references to the “Bride of Christ.”
