## Jairus (id: 6189)

JAIRUS
======

The leader of a synagogue, possibly at Capernaum. He found Jesus in the crowd and asked him to heal his dying daughter. While Jesus was delayed by another healing, Jairus learned that his daughter had died. Jesus encouraged him not to fear but to believe. Jesus then went to Jairus's house, sent the mourners away, and brought the girl back to life ([Mark 5:22, 35–42](https://ref.ly/Mark5:22,Mark5:35-Mark5:42); [Luke 8:41, 49–55](https://ref.ly/Luke8:41,Luke8:49-Luke8:55)).
