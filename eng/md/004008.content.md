## Naarah (Place) (id: 7265)

NAARAH (Place)
==============

City on the eastern border of Ephraim’s tribe, just north of Jericho ([Jos 16:7](https://ref.ly/Josh16:7)); alternately called Naaran in [1 Chronicles 7:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:28). Josephus locates it near Jericho and associates it with abundant water supply in Archelaus’s day (*Antiquities* 17\.13\.1\). Some locate Naarah at modern Tell el\-Gisr near ‘Ain Duq at the foot of the mountains northwest of Jericho. A synagogue dating to the fourth or fifth century AD has been excavated here; it contains a mosaic floor with a zodiac, an ark of the law, and other figures.
