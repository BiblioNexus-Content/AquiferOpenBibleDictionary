## Ir (id: 6057)

IR
==

Ir was a man from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the father of Shuppim and Huppim ([1 Chronicles 7:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:12)). Ir may be identical with Iri in verse [7](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:7). In [Numbers 24:19](https://ref.ly/Num24:19), the same Hebrew word is not used as a name. Instead, it is translated as "the city" in the King James Version and the New International Version.
