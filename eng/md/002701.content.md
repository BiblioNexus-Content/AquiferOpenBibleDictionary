## Hur (id: 5954)

HUR
===

1. Aaron’s assistant who helped lift Moses’s hands until the Amalekites were defeated at Rephidim ([Exodus 17:8–13](https://ref.ly/Exod17:8-Exod17:13)). He is mentioned again as helping Aaron Watch over Israel while Moses was on Mount Sinai ([24:14](https://ref.ly/Exod24:14)). According to Josephus, Hur was the husband of Miriam, the sister of Moses (*Antiquities* 3\.2\.4\).
2. The fourth of the five kings of Midian who was killed with Balaam by the Israelites under Moses ([Numbers 31:8](https://ref.ly/Num31:8)). He is also referred to as one of the “princes of Midian” and “Sihon” ([Joshua 13:21](https://ref.ly/Josh13:21)).
3. The father of one of the 12 officers that Solomon chose to provide food for the king’s household ([1 Kings 4:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:8), “Ben\-hur” in Berean Standard Bible).
4. The son of Caleb and Ephrath and the grandfather of Bezalel ([1 Chronicles 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:19-1Chr2:20); compare [Exodus 31:2](https://ref.ly/Exod31:2); [38:22](https://ref.ly/Exod38:22)). Some interpreters regard the Hur in \#1 as Bezalel's grandfather. Others think the Hur who assisted Moses was a different man.
5. The father (or perhaps family name) of Rephaiah, a leader after the exile in Babylon who helped Nehemiah rebuild the Jerusalem wall ([Nehemiah 3:9](https://ref.ly/Neh3:9)).
