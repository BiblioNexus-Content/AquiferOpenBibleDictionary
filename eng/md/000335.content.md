## Anath (id: 3600)

ANATH
=====

1. The parent of Shamgar, one of the judges of Israel ([Judges 3:31](https://ref.ly/Judg3:31); [5:6](https://ref.ly/Judg5:6)). Since the name Anath is feminine, it is likely that Anath was Shamgar’s mother.
2. Canaanite goddess of fertility. *See* Canaanite Deities and Religion.
