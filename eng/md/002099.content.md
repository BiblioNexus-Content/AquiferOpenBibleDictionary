1. A yellowish\-brown bitter substance made by the liver ([Job 16:13](https://ref.ly/Job16:13)) or the organ containing the gall ([20:25](https://ref.ly/Job20:25)).
2. A very bitter, poisonous herb. It might be the same as hemlock, colocynth, or poppy. The Hebrew word for "gall" also refers to:

    1. “Bitter fruit” ([Deuteronomy 29:18\)](https://ref.ly/Deut29:18)
        2. The “venom” of a venomous snake ([Job 20:14, 16\)](https://ref.ly/Job20:14,Job20:16)
        3. A poison given to a person for food ([Psalm 69:21\)](https://ref.ly/Ps69:21)
        4. A divine punishment as “poisoned water” ([Jeremiah 8:14](https://ref.ly/Jer8:14); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Jer9:15); [23:15](https://ref.ly/Jer23:15))
        5. Israel’s bitter experience of divine judgment ([Lamentations 3:5, 19](https://ref.ly/Lam3:5,Lam3:19))
        6. Divine judgment against Israel sprouting up like “poisonous weeds” in a field ([Hosea 10:4](https://ref.ly/Hos10:4))
        7. Israel’s perversion of justice by turning “justice into poison” ([Amos 6:12](https://ref.ly/Amos6:12)).
3. An unpleasant\-tasting substance in the New Testament. [Matthew 27:34](https://ref.ly/Matt27:34) mentions the gall mixed with wine that was offered to Christ on the cross. [Mark 15:23](https://ref.ly/Mark15:23) calls the substance “myrrh,” which might be the specific substance mixed with the wine. In [Acts 8:23,](https://ref.ly/Acts8:23) Peter described the spiritual state of Simon the magician as being “poisoned by bitterness.”
