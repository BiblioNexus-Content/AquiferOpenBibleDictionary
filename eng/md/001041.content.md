BOOK OF LIFE
============

A term used to refer to a record kept in heaven. 

The phrase appears seven times in the New Testament ([Philippians 4:3](https://ref.ly/Phil4:3); [Revelation 3:5](https://ref.ly/Rev3:5);[Revelation 13:8](https://ref.ly/Rev13:8); [Revelation 17:8](https://ref.ly/Rev17:8);[Revelation 20:12](https://ref.ly/Rev20:12,Rev20:15); [Revelation 20:15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:12,Rev20:15);[Revelation 21:27\).](https://ref.ly/Rev21:27)

The idea comes from the Old Testament, where several passages descrtibe God keeping a record of his people. Examples include [Exodus 32:32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:32); [Psalm 87:6](https://ref.ly/Ps87:6); [Daniel 7:10](https://ref.ly/Dan7:10); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1); and [Malachi 3:16](https://ref.ly/Mal3:16). These passages show that God records both the faithful actions and disobedience of his people. Some passages suggest God might also keep records of other nations (for example, [Psalm 87:6](https://ref.ly/Ps87:6)). In [Psalm 69:28](https://ref.ly/Ps69:28), we find the phrase “Book of Life,” and the surrounding poetic lines refer to physical life.

[Daniel 7:10](https://ref.ly/Dan7:10), [12:1](https://ref.ly/Dan12:1), and [Malachi 3:16](https://ref.ly/Mal3:16) connect divine records with final judgment and end\-time events. These passages describe names and deeds as evidence before a judge. [Luke 10:20](https://ref.ly/Luke10:20) and [Hebrews 12:23](https://ref.ly/Heb12:23) share this idea but do not mention a “book.” However, a heavenly record is assumed. In [Philippians 4:3](https://ref.ly/Phil4:3), Paul uses the term “Book of Life” to give them hope about their future with God.

In the book of Revelation, the "Book of Life" is a heavenly record that contains the names of people who stay faithful to God. It first appears in Revelation in the letter to the church in Sardis ([Revelation 3:5](https://ref.ly/Rev3:5)). Jesus, who is called "the Lamb," keeps this book ([Revelation 13:8](https://ref.ly/Rev13:8); [21:7](https://ref.ly/Rev21:7)). If a person’s name is found in the book, they are allowed to enter the new Jerusalem ([Revelation 20:15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:15); [21:27](https://ref.ly/Rev21:27)). If one’s name is not written there, their judgment is final destruction. Revelation tells us these names were “written from the foundation of the world” ([Revelation 13:8](https://ref.ly/Rev13:8); [17:8](https://ref.ly/Rev17:8)). This shows that God has always known and cared for his people.
