Author

Many people who doubt that Paul wrote the Pastoral Epistles agree that 2 Timothy includes some genuine parts from Paul, especially in the personal references. However, the evidence supporting Paul's authorship is stronger than the evidence against it. (See the discussion on the authorship of the Pastoral Letters under “Timothy, First Letter to.”)

Place and Date of Writing
-------------------------

Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter to Timothy. [Second Timothy 1:15–18](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:15-2Tim1:18) specifically mentions his time in Rome and how Onesiphorus remained loyal when others from Asia deserted him. [Second Timothy 2:9](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:9) also mentions his imprisonment for preaching the gospel. Toward the end of the letter, starting at [2 Timothy 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6), Paul shares his prison experience and his lack of hope for release. Second Timothy serves as a kind of last will and testament for the apostle. Early, reliable tradition states that Paul was martyred in Rome under Nero. Therefore, Rome was the place where 2 Timothy was written.

The letter was written to Timothy in Ephesus, as clearly stated throughout the letter.

Two possible years exist for when it was written. 

1. The year 64 AD marks the great fire in Rome. Nero tried to blame the Christians for the fire. Paul may have been martyred then.
2. Nero died in AD 67, so that is the latest possible date.

The letter was written between AD 64 and 67, with a preference for the earlier date.

Background
----------

After writing 1 Timothy, Paul traveled more and then reached Rome for his second imprisonment. See the section under “Timothy, First Letter to.”

### Greeting ([1:1–2](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:1-2Tim1:2))

In ancient letters, the writer typically starts with their name. The writer then identifies himself as an apostle, a follower of Jesus Christ, and someone tasked with sharing the message of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul uses this introduction to establish his authority and summarize the core of true Christian faith.

The letter is addressed to "Timothy, my beloved child." It includes a triple blessing: "Grace, mercy, and peace" from God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ. Paul, as in all his letters, replaces the plain Greek greeting, "greetings," with the profound theological term, "grace." He also adds the Greek translation of the common Hebrew greeting, "peace." Here, he includes the important word, "mercy," as he did in 1 Timothy.

### Exhortations to Timothy to Be a Good Minister ([1:3–2:13](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:3-2Tim2:13))

Paul starts this section by telling Timothy how often he prayed to God, thanking him for Timothy. Paul prayed to the God of his ancestors, whom he aimed to please. Paul really wanted to see Timothy, especially when he remembered their tearful goodbye.

Paul reminded Timothy of his strong faith in the Lord, a faith passed down by his mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois. [Acts 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1-Acts16:3) mentions that Timothy's mother was a Jewish believer, while his father was a Greek, or Gentile. His father did not have him circumcised as a baby. However, his mother shared her faith with him. When Paul chose Timothy to join him on his second missionary journey, he had Timothy circumcised to help him work better with the Jews. Timothy inherited a rich spiritual legacy from Lois, Eunice, and Paul.

"I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" ([2 Timothy 1:6](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:6)). [First Timothy 4:14](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:14) adds, "the laying on of the hands of the elders." This suggests a formal ordination service, where Timothy was set apart as a minister of the gospel through the laying on of hands and prayer. Timothy should always remember that solemn moment, which should fill his life with strength and courage. He was truly a man of God, filled with the spirit, and unafraid to do his Christian work. Timothy might suffer for his faith, but he could find encouragement in the sufferings and imprisonment of his spiritual father, Paul. God would give Timothy the strength to endure suffering, just as he did for Paul.

Paul reminded Timothy that God saved both of them and chose them long ago to share God's love through Jesus Christ. Jesus came to defeat death and show the path to eternal life. Paul knew what he believed, but more importantly, he knew whom he trusted—Jesus Christ. Despite many uncertainties, Paul was certain about Christ. Paul was also sure that Christ would protect what was entrusted to him until they met again. Paul wanted Timothy to have the same confidence.

Paul encouraged Timothy to firmly follow the teachings he had learned from Paul. These teachings focused on Jesus Christ and the faith and love in Christ. Timothy should protect this knowledge carefully, with help from the holy spirit.

Paul shared with Timothy his deep sorrow that all the Christians in the Roman province of Asia, where Ephesus was the main city, had abandoned him. Paul named two deserters, Phygelus and Hermogenes, whom Timothy evidently knew. In contrast, Paul praised Onesiphorus (also mentioned at [2 Timothy 4:19](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19)), who was a wonderful and faithful helper to Paul in both Ephesus and Rome.

Paul urged Timothy to be strong with the strength Christ gave him ([2 Timothy 2:1](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:1)). Timothy should teach Christian truths to others and train them to teach more people. Paul likely thought of the elders and deacons (compare 1 Timothy). Paul used three illustrations to motivate Timothy to excel in his Christian service. Timothy should: 

1. Fight and endure like a good soldier
2. Compete well like a good athlete
3. Work hard like a good farmer

If they do their tasks well, all three will receive rewards. Jesus and other New Testament writers also used these illustrations.

During his teachings, Paul gave a clear summary of true Christology in [2 Timothy 2:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:8-2Tim2:10). Jesus was fully human and fully God. It is wrong to deny either the complete humanity or the complete divinity of Christ, even though no human can fully understand the mystery of the Incarnation. This divine\-human being died and then rose from the dead.

### Warnings against Heresy ([2:14–4:5](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:14-2Tim4:5))

This section starts with the statement, “RRemind the believers of these things, charging them before God to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.” Some beliefs are wrong and should be condemned, but Christians are warned not to argue about unimportant matters. Christians may become angry with each other and waste time fighting among themselves instead of opposing Satan.

Timothy needed to work hard to become a good servant and earn his Master's approval by understanding his teachings. This way, he could fight against false teachings. Two heretics, Hymenaeus and Philetus, are mentioned. Philetus is only named here in the New Testament. Hymenaeus is also mentioned in [1 Timothy 1:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:20) with another heretic, Alexander. Paul had excommunicated them by handing them over to Satan. They falsely taught that the resurrection of believers had already occurred ([2 Timothy 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:18)). This false teaching weakened the Christian hope of the final resurrection, which brings all believers into eternity. The heretics denied this reality and claimed it had already happened.

Paul encouraged Timothy to show he was a true servant of God. He should be known by God and live by God's truths. Timothy should avoid the harmful thoughts common to young men and resist the urge to argue. Instead, he should be gentle, patient, and humble, helping his people avoid Satan's traps.

[Second Timothy 3:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim3:9) contains Paul's strongest criticism of the false teachers in the church. They attend church but do not believe in Christian truths. They do not live Christian lives and try to persuade others to follow their beliefs. Paul compared these false teachers to the Egyptian magicians in [Exodus 7](https://ref.ly/Exod7:1-Exod7:25) (Jewish tradition calls them Jannes and Jambres). The false teachers in Timothy's time would fail in their attacks on the truth, just as Jannes and Jambres failed in their attacks on God and Moses.

Paul compared his life and beliefs to those of the heretics. Heretics had persecuted him, even during his first missionary journey. Despite this, he continued to preach the truth and led many to accept Christ. Timothy should follow Paul's example.

The best way to overcome false beliefs is to carefully study the Word of God. “All Scripture is God\-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work” ([2 Timothy 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16-2Tim3:17)).

Paul instructed Timothy to preach the word faithfully and diligently. Many might not want to hear the Bible's truths, but Timothy should try to correct and rebuke them, even if it leads to persecution.

### Paul’s Faith and Hope ([4:6–18](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6-2Tim4:18))

Paul wrote these important instructions to Timothy because he knew he had little time left on earth: “For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand” ([2 Timothy 4:6](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:6)). He can look back with satisfaction on a life of true faith and service. He can confidently look forward to his crown of victory in eternity. This faith helped Paul face death bravely, and it will do the same for all Christians who see the second coming as a blessed hope.

Paul asked Timothy to come to Rome to be with him. Luke was the only friend still with Paul. Paul mentioned other friends who had left. Demas had disappointed him. Crescens, Titus, and Tychicus had gone to other places. Paul asked Timothy to bring his coat from Troas, where he left it with Carpus. He also wanted his books, especially those on parchment, likely copies of Scripture. Paul warned Timothy about Alexander the coppersmith, an evil man (see [1 Timothy 1:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:20)).

During Paul's first trial, all his friends abandoned him. However, God stayed with him and saved him. Paul even had the chance to share the gospel with the world.

### Final Greetings ([4:19–22](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:19-2Tim4:22))

Paul sent greetings to many of his friends in Ephesus. He also sent greetings to Timothy from some Roman Christians he knew. He urged Timothy to visit him before winter, when travel would be hard or impossible. He concluded with a short blessing: “The Lord be with your spirit.”
