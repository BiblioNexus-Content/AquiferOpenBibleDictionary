## Dill (id: 4844)

DILL
====

Dill (*Anethum graveolens*) is a weedy annual plant that looks similar to parsley and fennel. It grows 30\.5 to 50\.8 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) tall and has yellow flowers. People used dill as a general seasoning, especially for pickles. It also had some medical uses. This plant is grown in many places for its seeds. The seeds have a strong, pleasant smell and help with digestion.

The King James Version translates the Greek word *anēthon* in[Matthew 23:23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23) as "anise" instead of "dill." This is considered incorrect by most scholars.
