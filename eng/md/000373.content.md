## Antioch of Pisidia (id: 3636)

ANTIOCH OF PISIDIA
==================

A city in Asia Minor between the districts of Phrygia and Pisidia. The apostle Paul traveled there to introduce the gospel. Paul was invited by the elders of the synagogue in Antioch. They invited him to deliver any message of encouragement he might have at their Sabbath or Saturday meeting ([Acts 13:14–15](https://ref.ly/Acts13:14-Acts13:15)). 

According to the record in Acts, many begged to hear more ([13:42](https://ref.ly/Acts13:42)). Some of the Jewish leaders were jealous of Paul because he was popular. They began to say harmful things about him ([13:45](https://ref.ly/Acts13:45)). Paul then turned to gentile listeners ([13:46–48](https://ref.ly/Acts13:46-Acts13:48)). Some of the Jewish authorities forced him to leave the city ([13:50](https://ref.ly/Acts13:50)). The same Jews from Antioch continued to attack Paul as he traveled to Lystra ([Acts 14:19](https://ref.ly/Acts14:19)). Paul traveled through Antioch a second time while on his way to Perga and Attalia ([14:21](https://ref.ly/Acts14:21)).

The city of Antioch was built around 300 BC by Seleucus Nicator. He named the city for his son, Antiochus I. As a result of the Roman conquest in 188 BC, the area was declared free from the rule of the Seleucid kings. The Romans began immediately making it more like their cities. In about 36 BC, Antony made Antioch part of the territory of the Galatian king, Amyntas. Upon the death of Amyntas 11 years later, the city was given colony status and became Caesarea Antiochela. It was the capital of southern Galatia.
