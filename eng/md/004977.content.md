## Serpent’s Stone (id: 8240)

SERPENT’S STONE\*
=================

Place where Adonijah, the son of David, sacrificed sheep and oxen and attempted to secretly set himself up as king ([1 Kgs 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9), nlt mg). The serpent’s stone was located near En\-rogel, a spring in the Kidron Valley located just south of Jerusalem. Some suggest that this stone was named for the large stone conduits nearby that emptied into the pool of Siloam, for a steep rock formation, or perhaps for a cultic shrine with the serpent used as its emblem. The Stone of Zoheleth is the English equivalent for the Hebrew term.
