## Almug (id: 3524)

ALMUG
=====

The almug is a valuable wood that King Solomon imported to build pillars in the temple and to make harps for the temple musicians ([1 Kings 10:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:11-1Kgs10:12)). This wood was brought by ship from Ophir to Ezion\-geber, a port near Elath. Today, scholars think Ophir might have been in Arabia, India, or East Africa near Mozambique. The word "algum" in [2 Chronicles 2:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:8) probably refers to the same type of wood.  
  
The scientific name of the almug tree is *Pterocarpus santalinus.*

*See* Algum.
