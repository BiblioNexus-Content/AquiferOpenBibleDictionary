## Kir (id: 6618)

KIR
===

1\. Mesopotamian city from which the Syrians migrated to Damascus and back to which they were later exiled by the Assyrians ([Am 1:5](https://ref.ly/Amos1:5); [9:7](https://ref.ly/Amos9:7)). Escape from Kir to Aram paralleled the exodus of the Israelites. It must have been a terribly bitter experience to have been deported (by Tiglath\-pileser) back to Kir ([2 Kgs 16:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:9)). Whether the city actually existed or not is debatable. It could have become a metaphor for enslavement and exile.

2\. Fortress usually identified with the ancient capital of Moab. Soldiers from Kir were associated with those from Elam ([Is 22:6](https://ref.ly/Isa22:6)). Likewise, Kir was paralleled with Ar in Isaiah’s lament over Moab ([15:1](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1)). Kir of Moab, therefore, is probably the same as Kir\-hareseth ([2 Kgs 3:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:25); [Is 16:7](https://ref.ly/Isa16:7)), located at Kerak, 11 miles (17\.7 kilometers) east of the southern end of the Dead Sea.
