## Andronicus (id: 3605)

ANDRONICUS
==========

1. The second\-in\-command of the Seleucid king Antiochus Epiphanes. This Andronicus angered the Jews by murdering Onias, the high priest. Then Antiochus gave the order for Andronicus to be put to death ([2 Maccabees 4:31–38](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:31-2Macc4:38)).
2. The officer in charge of Gerizim after Antiochus Epiphanes destroyed Jerusalem ([2 Maccabees 5:21–23](https://ref.ly/2Macc5:21-2Macc5:23)).
3. A Christian greeted by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans ([16:7](https://ref.ly/Rom16:7)). He is not mentioned elsewhere. Paul called Andronicus his kinsman. The word could mean fellow countryman, fellow Jew, member of Paul’s own family, or other relative. Andronicus may also have been a fellow prisoner for the cause of Christ. He could have perhaps even been in the same prison with Paul ([2 Corinthians 6:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4-2Cor6:5); [11:23](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23)). Paul described him as important among the apostles and recognized him respectfully as an “older” Christian.
