## Black Cumin, Black Caraway, Nutmeg Flower (id: 718702)

BLACK CUMIN, BLACK CARAWAY, NUTMEG FLOWER
=========================================

The "caraway" mentioned in [Isaiah 28:25–27](https://ref.ly/Isa28:25-Isa28:27) ("fitches" in the King James Version) likely refer to *Nigella sativa*. This plant is sometimes called black cumin, black caraway, or nutmeg flower. This annual plant belongs to the buttercup family (*Ranunculaceae*). It grows wild in southern Europe, Syria, Egypt, North Africa, and other Mediterranean regions, and is cultivated for its flavorful seeds.

The black seeds have a spicy, pepper\-like taste and aroma. People in Eastern countries sprinkle them over breads and cakes, and use them to flavor curries and other dishes, both historically and today.

Farmers in Israel and the surrounding areas still harvest cumin and Nigella using the gentle methods that Isaiah described, showing how traditional agricultural practices have remained largely unchanged.
