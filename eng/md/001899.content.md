## Eshtemoa, Eshtemoh (Place) (id: 5154)

ESHTEMOA, ESHTEMOH (Place)
==========================

City south of Jerusalem allotted to Judah when Palestine was divided among the 12 tribes ([Jos 15:50](https://ref.ly/Josh15:50)). Eshtemoa was assigned to the Levites ([Jos 21:14](https://ref.ly/Josh21:14); [1 Chr 6:57](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:57)). After an Amalekite victory, David sent booty to his allies in Eshtemoa ([1 Sm 30:26–31](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:26-1Sam30:31)). The site may be modern al\-Samu’a, eight miles (13 kilometers) south of Hebron.
