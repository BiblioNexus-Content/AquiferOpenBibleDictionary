## Bread of the Presence (id: 4329)

BREAD OF THE PRESENCE
=====================

The loaves of bread that were placed on a special table in the sanctuary or Holy Place of the tabernacle, and later in the temple. 

What Was the Meaning of the Bread of the Presence?
--------------------------------------------------

"Showbread" is another term in the Old Testament used to describe the “bread of the Presence,” or bread that has been set before the Lord’s face ([Exodus 25:23, 30](https://ref.ly/Exod25:23,Exod25:30); [35:13](https://ref.ly/Exod35:13); [39:36](https://ref.ly/Exod39:36); [1 Kings 7:48](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:48); [2 Chronicles 4:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:19)). The term “showbread” refers to how the bread was arranged in rows on the table ([1 Chronicles 9:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:32); [23:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:29); [28:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:16); [2 Chronicles 2:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:4); [13:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:11); [29:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:18)).

The table of showbread, the altar of incense, and the golden lampstand were not in the Holy of Holies, but they were still believed to be in the presence of God. The loaves were offerings placed before the presence of God, so they were holy and could only be eaten by priests. Later in Israel’s history, a tax of one\-third shekel on all citizens funded the bread of the Presence and other temple services ([Nehemiah 10:32](https://ref.ly/Neh10:32-Neh10:33)–[33](https://ref.ly/Neh10:32-Neh10:33)).

What Was the Bread of the Presence? How Was It Prepared?
--------------------------------------------------------

The bread of the Presence was 12 very large loaves. Each loaf was made of one\-fifth ephah of fine flour, or 30\.3 liters of wheat for all 12 loaves. They were sprinkled with frankincense. The loaves were arranged in two rows, one leaning on the other, and placed on the table of showbread ([Leviticus 24:5–9](https://ref.ly/Lev24:5-Lev24:9)). Arranged this way, the bread was an “offering of food” to the Lord. The loaves were changed every Sabbath.

The Bread of the Presence in the New Testament
----------------------------------------------

The bread of the Presence is mentioned once in the New Testament. When David was fleeing from Saul, he went to Ahimelech, the priest at the tabernacle in Nob, in search of food ([1 Samuel 21:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:6)–[6](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:6)). The only food Ahimelech had was the showbread, and he agreed to share it with David’s men if they had been sexually pure for some time before eating. Jesus later referred to the incident, comparing it to his ministry and meeting the needs of his followers ([Matthew 12:1](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8)–[8](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8); [Mark 2:25](https://ref.ly/Mark2:25-Mark2:26)–[26](https://ref.ly/Mark2:25-Mark2:26); [Luke 6:1](https://ref.ly/Luke6:1-Luke6:5)–[5](https://ref.ly/Luke6:1-Luke6:5)). David and his men were God’s anointed and allowed to eat the holy bread. In this way, Jesus provided for others' needs despite Sabbath rules.
