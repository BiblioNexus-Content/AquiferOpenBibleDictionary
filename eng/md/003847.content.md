MICAH (Person)
==============

1\. Ephraimite judge who had idols made and then hired a Levite to become his priest ([Jgs 17–18](https://ref.ly/Judg17:1-Judg18:31)).

2\. Shimei’s descendant from Reuben’s tribe ([1 Chr 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:5)).

3\. Alternate spelling of Mica, Mephibosheth’s son and the great\-grandson of King Saul, in [1 Chronicles 8:34–35](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:34-1Chr8:35); [9:40–41](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:40-1Chr9:41). *See* Mica \#1.

4\. KJV spelling of Mica, Zicri’s son, in [1 Chronicles 9:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:15). *See* Mica \#2.

5\. Levite and Uzziel’s son from Kohath’s clan, whose temple responsibilities included care of the furniture and equipment ([1 Chr 23:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:20); [24:24–25](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:24-1Chr24:25)).

6\. Alternate spelling of Micaiah, Acbor’s father, in [2 Chronicles 34:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:20). *See* Micaiah \#2.

7\. Prophet and author of the OT book that bears his name ([Mi 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mic1:1)). A native of Moresheth, a town about 21 miles (33\.8 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem, Micah prophesied to both northern and southern kingdoms during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (750–686 BC). According to [Micah 1:9](https://ref.ly/Mic1:9), he was still prophesying in 701 BC when the Assyrian armies under Sennacherib (cf. [Is 36–37](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa37:38)) besieged Jerusalem. About 100 years later, Micah is used as an example of an early prophet who predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (cf. [Jer 26:16–19](https://ref.ly/Jer26:16-Jer26:19)).
