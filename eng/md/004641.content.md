## Rachel (id: 7905)

RACHEL
======

Beautiful younger daughter of Laban; she was the favorite wife of Jacob. He first met her as he arrived at Haran in Paddan\-aram. There, he helped her by tending to her father's sheep. He removed a stone from a well to water them ([Genesis 29:10](https://ref.ly/Gen29:10)). Jacob loved Rachel deeply. He agreed to work seven years for Laban for her hand in marriage. His seven years’ service seemed like only a few days because of his great love for her. Laban, deceitful, broke his bargain. He made Jacob marry Leah, his older, less attractive daughter, before giving him Rachel. Unlike Leah, Rachel was barren in the early years of her marriage to Jacob ([Genesis 30:1](https://ref.ly/Gen30:1)). So, she gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob to have children. Thus, through this commonly accepted ancient custom, Dan and Naphtali were born. In time, Rachel herself conceived and bore Joseph ([Genesis 30:22](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:25)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:25)[25](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:25)). After this, Jacob took his wives, children, and possessions away from Haran.

Somewhere between Bethel and Bethlehem, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin ([Genesis 35:16, 19](https://ref.ly/Gen35:16,Gen35:19)). Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb there, a landmark known even in the days of Saul ([1 Samuel 10:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:2)). Rachel and Leah are highly regarded as those who built up the house of Israel ([Ruth 4:11](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:11)). In [Jeremiah 31:15](https://ref.ly/Jer31:15), Rachel is pictured as crying for her children being carried off into captivity. Later, Matthew recalls Jeremiah’s words in Herod’s slaughter of the male infants ([Matthew 2:18](https://ref.ly/Matt2:18)).
