## Blood Avenger (id: 4272)

BLOOD AVENGER
=============

A person (also called an avenger of blood) who tried to bring justice by killing a murderer. This person was usually the closest family member of the one who had been killed.

The law of Moses gave rules for this kind of revenge killing. These rules helped prevent unfair deaths and protected those who killed by accident.
