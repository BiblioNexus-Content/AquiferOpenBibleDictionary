## King’s Garden (id: 6591)

KING’S GARDEN
=============

Probably an area of the royal estates, situated outside the walls of Jerusalem near the pool of Siloam ([2 Kgs 25:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:4); [Jer 39:4](https://ref.ly/Jer39:4); [52:7](https://ref.ly/Jer52:7)) in the Kidron Valley, near where the Kidron meets the valley of Hinnom. Upon the return from the exile, Nehemiah set the families to work, each building a part of the wall. Fountain Gate is recorded as being near the pool of Siloam by the king’s garden ([Neh 3:15](https://ref.ly/Neh3:15)). It is not certain whether the site now called the king’s garden outside the walls of modern Jerusalem is the original site.
