## Hazeroth (id: 5738)

HAZEROTH
========

Camp of the Israelites during their wanderings in the desert. It was the third camp from Mt Sinai ([Nm 11:35](https://ref.ly/Num11:35); [12:16](https://ref.ly/Num12:16); [33:17–18](https://ref.ly/Num33:17-Num33:18); [Dt 1:1](https://ref.ly/Deut1:1)). Here Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses for marrying a Cushite woman and questioned whether God spoke only through Moses ([Nm 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:2)). The site is probably modern ‘Ain Khadra, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Jebel Musa.
