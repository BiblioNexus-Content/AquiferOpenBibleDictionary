## Paraclete (id: 7575)

Paraclete\*
===========

Transliteration of a Greek word meaning “one who is called to someone’s aid” or “one who advocates for another.” Thus, the term may be used technically for a lawyer. More generally, the word denotes one who acts in another’s behalf as a mediator, an intercessor, or an encourager. In [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)Christ is called a paraclete because he represents people to God. This function is akin to his ministry as High Priest (cf. [Heb 7:25–28](https://ref.ly/Heb7:25-Heb7:28)).

The most numerous uses of “paraclete” come in John’s Gospel, all referring to the work of the Holy Spirit ([Jn 14:16, 26](https://ref.ly/John14:16,John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:13](https://ref.ly/John16:13)). In these passages Jesus declares that the Holy Spirit will come from the Father when he departs. The Paraclete, also called “the Spirit of truth,” will lead them into all truth and aid them in their ability to recall correctly Jesus’ message. He is to become their special replacement for the departed Lord.
