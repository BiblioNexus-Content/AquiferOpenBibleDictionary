## Chief Priest (id: 4520)

CHIEF PRIEST
============

The chief priest was the highest leader among the priests and Levites in ancient Israel.

Only the chief priest could enter the most holy place in the temple. He did this once a year to make atonement (a special sacrifice to cover sins) for the whole nation of Israel. This happened on the Day of Atonement.
