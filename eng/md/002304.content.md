HABAZZINIAH
===========

Jaazaniah’s grandfather. Jaazaniah was a leader of the Recabites, warriors tested by Jeremiah with regard to their forefather’s command not to drink wine ([Jer 35:3](https://ref.ly/Jer35:3)). They remained loyal to the command, and Jeremiah used their loyalty in an appeal to Judah to be faithful to God.

* **Associated Passages:** JER 35:3
