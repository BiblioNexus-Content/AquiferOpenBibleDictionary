## Animals (id: 3614)

ANIMALS
=======

In the Bible, "animals" refers to all living (and extinct) creatures except humans and plants. Animals are mentioned throughout the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. 

Animals are important in many Bible stories, including:

* When God created the world
* When Adam and Eve disobeyed God
* When Noah saved the animals from the great flood
* When God sent ten plagues to Egypt
* When the Hebrew people used animals in their worship
* During the life of Jesus

The people who lived in Bible times, both in the Old Testament and New Testament, spent much of their time around animals. They knew a lot about different kinds of animals. This is why Jesus and the people who wrote the Bible often used animals as examples to teach important ideas.

The Bible and modern science group animals in different ways.

Modern scientists group animals based on what they look like on the outside and inside. This way of grouping animals was started by Carolus Linnaeus, a plant expert who lived in Sweden during the 1700s.

The Bible groups animals based on where they live. In [Genesis 1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31), God created different types of animals:

* Animals that live in the sea ([Genesis 1:20](https://ref.ly/Gen1:20))
* Animals that live in the sky ([Genesis 1:21](https://ref.ly/Gen1:21))
* Animals that crawl on the ground ([Genesis 1:24](https://ref.ly/Gen1:24))
* Domesticated animals that live with humans ([Genesis 1:24](https://ref.ly/Gen1:24))
* Wild animals ([Genesis 1:24](https://ref.ly/Gen1:24))

This same way of grouping animals appears in other parts of the Bible, including [Leviticus 11](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev11:47). 

Because these two ways of grouping animals are different, we list the Bible's animals in order from A to Z. This list includes:

* Reptiles (cold\-blooded animals that usually have scaly skin, such as snakes)
* Fish (animals that live in water, such as sardines)
* Invertebrates (animals without backbones, such as insects, spiders, and worms)

Specific types of animals are listed below. Birds are discussed in a separate article (*see* Birds). Click on an animal listed below to access the full\-length article.
