## Peleg (id: 7632)

PELEG
=====

The son of Eber and father of Reu ([Genesis 10:25](https://ref.ly/Gen10:25); [11:16](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:19)[19](https://ref.ly/Gen11:16-Gen11:19); [1 Chronicles 1:19, 25](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:19,1Chr1:25); [Luke 3:35](https://ref.ly/Luke3:35)). During his lifetime, the earth was divided (*Peleg* means “division” or “watercourse”). It is unclear what this division refers to. Suggestions include: 

1. The spread of languages after the Tower of Babel ([Genesis 11:1](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Gen11:1-Gen11:9))
2. The spread of Noah’s descendants
3. The separation of the people of Arphaxad from Joktanide Arabs ([Genesis 10:24](https://ref.ly/Gen10:24-Gen10:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen10:24-Gen10:29)[29](https://ref.ly/Gen10:24-Gen10:29))
4. The division of land by canals (the term is used in this way in [Job 29:6](https://ref.ly/Job29:6); [38:25](https://ref.ly/Job38:25); [Isaiah 30:25](https://ref.ly/Isa30:25); [32:2](https://ref.ly/Isa32:2))

The name's origin is usually traced to the city of Phalga, north of the junction of the Euphrates and Khabur rivers.
