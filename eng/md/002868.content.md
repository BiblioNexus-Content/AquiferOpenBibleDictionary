IVVAH

City that had already fallen along with others to the Assyrians ([2 Kgs 18:34](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:34); [19:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:13); [Is 37:13](https://ref.ly/Isa37:13)). Sennacherib’s representative mocked Hezekiah’s belief that God would save Jerusalem. Ivvah was probably in Syria.
