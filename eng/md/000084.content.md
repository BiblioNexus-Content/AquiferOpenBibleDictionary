## Achor (id: 3343)

ACHOR
=====

A valley that was named after Achan, who brought trouble to Israel and was stoned and burned there ([Joshua 7:24](https://ref.ly/Josh7:24-Josh7:26)–[26](https://ref.ly/Josh7:24-Josh7:26); compare [1 Chronicles 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:7)). Achor was in the north of Judah ([Joshua 15:7](https://ref.ly/Josh15:7)). Later, the valley is mentioned in prophecies of Israel’s future blessings. A valley once known for Israel’s trouble would become “a gateway of hope,” and a place for joyful singing ([Hosea 2:15](https://ref.ly/Hos2:15)). A place of barrenness would become a place for herds to lie down ([Isaiah 65:10](https://ref.ly/Isa65:10)). The valley of Achor is identified as the Buqei‘ah.
