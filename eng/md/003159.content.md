JOIADA
======

1\. Paseah’s son who, with Meshullam, repaired the Old Gate in the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah ([Neh 3:6](https://ref.ly/Neh3:6)).

2\. Levite and high priest in Jerusalem during the postexilic era, the great\-grandson of Jeshua, son of Eliashib, and father of Jonathan (“Johanan” or “Jehohanan,” [Neh 12:10–11, 22](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10-Neh12:11,Neh12:22)).
