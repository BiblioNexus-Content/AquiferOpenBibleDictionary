## Bamah (id: 3986)

BAMAH
=====

The Hebrew word meaning height, ridge, or elevation in the landscape ([2 Samuel 1:19, 25](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:19,2Sam1:25); [22:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:34)). It is written in English once ([Ezra 20:29](https://ref.ly/Ezek20:29)). It refers to hills or mountains overlooking the Arnon River ([Numbers 21:28](https://ref.ly/Num21:28)). The plural form, Bamoth, is used for the name of towns in Moab ([Numbers 21:19](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Num21:19-Num21:20); [22:41](https://ref.ly/Num22:41); [Joshua 13:17](https://ref.ly/Josh13:17)).

Metaphorically, the word signifies: 

* A place of security ([Deuteronomy 32:13](https://ref.ly/Deut32:13); [Hebrews 3:19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:19))
* The high ground a military commander aims to control in battle.

Controlling an enemy’s "heights" meant subjugating that enemy ([Deuteronomy 33:29](https://ref.ly/Deut33:29); [Ezekiel 36:2](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:2)). The term often combines both literal and figurative meanings when referring to Jerusalem, a "high place" in ruin overgrown with plants ([Micah 3:12](https://ref.ly/Mic3:12); see also [Jeremiah 26:18](https://ref.ly/Jer26:18); [Ezekiel 36:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:1-Ezek36:2)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:1-Ezek36:2)[2](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:1-Ezek36:2)). 

In Canaanite religion, a "high place" was a local shrine on a hill near a town or village, unlike the larger temples spread throughout the land.
