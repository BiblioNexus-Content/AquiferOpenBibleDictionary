## Shelah (id: 8334)

SHELAH
======

1. Arphaxad’s son and the father of Eber ([Genesis 10:24](https://ref.ly/Gen10:24); [11:12](https://ref.ly/Gen11:12-Gen11:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen11:12-Gen11:15)[15](https://ref.ly/Gen11:12-Gen11:15); [1 Chronicles 1:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:18)). Shelah is listed in Luke’s list of Jesus's ancestors as the son of Cainan the son of Arphaxad ([Luke 3:35](https://ref.ly/Luke3:35)).

    *See* Ancestry of Jesus Christ.

2. Judah’s third son by Bathshua, a Canaanite woman. He was born at Kezib, a small town in Judah ([Genesis 38:5](https://ref.ly/Gen38:5); [1 Chronicles 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3)). Shelah founded the Shelanite family ([Numbers 26:20](https://ref.ly/Num26:20)). "Shelanite" should possibly be read instead of "Shilonite" in [Nehemiah 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5); [1 Chronicles 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:5).
