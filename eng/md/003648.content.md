## Mallow, Saltwort (id: 6906)

MALLOW, SALTWORT
================

A shrubby plant mentioned in [30:4](https://ref.ly/Job30:4). The Hebrew word used in this verse suggests saltiness. Because of this, plant experts believe it refers to one of the species of saltwort or orach.

Twenty\-one species of saltwort grow in Israel and the surrounding areas. Almost all of these are common plants that could match what the Bible describes. *Atriplex halimus* is the species most commonly suggested. It is a strong\-growing bushy shrub related to spinach.
