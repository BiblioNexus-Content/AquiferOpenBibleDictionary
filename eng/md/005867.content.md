## Zabad (id: 9112)

ZABAD
=====

1\. Son of Nathan ([1 Chr 2:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:36)) and a descendant of Ahlai the daughter of Sheshan (vv [30, 34–36](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:30,1Chr2:34-1Chr2:36)).

2\. Tahath’s son and the father of Shuthelah from Ephraim’s tribe ([1 Chr 7:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:21)).

3\. One of David’s mighty men, listed as a son of Ahlai ([1 Chr 11:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:41)); he is perhaps the same as \#1 above.

4\. One of the assassins of King Joash, listed as the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess ([2 Chr 24:26](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:26)). He is identical to Jozacar (alternately “Jozabad”) in [2 Kings 12:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:21). Zabad was a palace official who was likely the agent of a powerful conspiracy against Joash.

*See also* Jozacar, Jozachar.

5–7\. Three priests variously descended from Zattu, Hashum, and Nebo, who renounced their foreign wives at Ezra’s request during the postexilic period ([Ezr 10:27, 33, 43](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:27,Ezra10:33,Ezra10:43)).
