MEDAD
=====

An elder of Israel who prophesied during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness. God gave him and another leader named Eldad special messages to share with the people. Joshua was worried when he saw them speaking God's messages, but Moses told Joshua this was good and that they had the right to share what God told them ([Numbers 11:26–27](https://ref.ly/Num11:26-Num11:27)).
