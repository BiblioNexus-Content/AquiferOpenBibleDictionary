## Ovens, Tower of the (id: 7535)

OVENS, Tower of the
===================

Structure in the Jerusalem wall restored by Nehemiah and his workmen after the exile ([Neh 3:11](https://ref.ly/Neh3:11); [12:38](https://ref.ly/Neh12:38)). Malkijah, son of Harim, and Hasshub, son of Pahath\-moab, are named as its builders. The tower was likely a defensive work on the northwest section of the wall, named for its proximity to nearby baking ovens.
