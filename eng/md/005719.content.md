## Uphaz (id: 8969)

UPHAZ
=====

A region well known for its gold ([Jeremiah 10:9](https://ref.ly/Jer10:9); [Daniel 10:5](https://ref.ly/Dan10:5)). Some argue that Uphaz is a copying mistake for Ophir because only one letter is different in Hebrew. Ophir is another region famous for its fine gold.
