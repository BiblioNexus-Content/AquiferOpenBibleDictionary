## Pelonite (id: 7638)

PELONITE
========

A title given to two of David's mighty warriors: Helez and Ahijah ([1 Chronicles 11:27, 36](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27,1Chr11:36); [27:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:10)). No one knows for sure where this place ("Pelon") was located or what the name ("Pelonite") means. Because of this uncertainty, some Bible scholars think "Pelonite" might be a mistake in the copying of ancient texts.

In another list of David's warriors found in [2 Samuel 23:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:26), Helez is called a "Paltite" (someone from Palt). Also, Ahijah is probably the same person as "Eliam the Gilonite" mentioned in [2 Samuel 23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34). Many scholars believe these names (Paltite and Gilonite) are more accurate than "Pelonite." 

Others suggest that Pelonite comes from the town name “Beth\-pelet” (see [Joshua 15:27](https://ref.ly/Josh15:27); [Nehemiah 11:26](https://ref.ly/Neh11:26)).
