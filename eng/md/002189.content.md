## Gibbar (id: 5445)

GIBBAR
======

Forefather of a family that returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:20](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:20)). The parallel list in [Nehemiah 7:25](https://ref.ly/Neh7:25) reads “sons of Gibeon,” suggesting that “Gibbar” may be a textual corruption. Some support for this view lies in the fact that [Ezra 2:21](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:21) begins listing descendants by their home city rather than by family.
