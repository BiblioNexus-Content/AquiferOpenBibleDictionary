## Ophel (id: 7505)

OPHEL
=====

1\. Hill or mound in Samaria where Elisha’s house stood ([2 Kgs 5:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:24)).

2\. Fortification in the southeast portion of ancient Jerusalem high above the slopes of the Brook Kidron, strengthened by Jotham ([2 Chr 27:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3)) and Manasseh ([33:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:14)). Isaiah described the destruction of such a fortress when prophesying the judgment of God upon Jerusalem ([Is 32:14](https://ref.ly/Isa32:14)). After the exile, the temple servants lived there and repaired its walls ([Neh 3:26–27](https://ref.ly/Neh3:26-Neh3:27); [11:21](https://ref.ly/Neh11:21)). Josephus states that it was near the temple. Archaeological excavations at the traditional site in Jerusalem reveal fortifications dating from pre\-Israelite times to the Maccabean period.
