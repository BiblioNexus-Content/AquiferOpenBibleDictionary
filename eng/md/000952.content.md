## Bezer (Place) (id: 4223)

BEZER (Place)
=============

A city of refuge in Reuben’s land in the desert, east of the Jordan River ([Deuteronomy 4:43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:43); [Joshua 20:8](https://ref.ly/Josh20:8)). It was later given to the Merari family of Levites ([Joshua 21:36](https://ref.ly/Josh21:36); [1 Chronicles 6:78](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:78)). It is probably a different spelling of Bozrah in [Jeremiah 48:24](https://ref.ly/Jer48:24). According to the Moabite Stone, Bezer was among the cities rebuilt by King Mesha of Moab.
