## Oboth (id: 7457)

OBOTH
=====

Oboth was a temporary camping place of the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. It was located between Punon and Iye\-abarim ([Numbers 21:10–11](https://ref.ly/Num21:10-Num21:11); [33:43–44](https://ref.ly/Num33:43-Num33:44)). Its exact location is uncertain. Some scholars have attempted to identify Oboth with ‘Ain el\-Weiba, which is 53\.1 kilometers (33 miles) south of the Dead Sea in the Arabah Valley.
