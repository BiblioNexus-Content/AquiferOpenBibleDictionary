## Counsel, Counselor (id: 4668)

COUNSEL, COUNSELOR
==================

Counsel is advice. A counselor is someone who gives advice, especially on legal matters. Lawyers are often called counselors. In Bible times, a counselor in a king’s court was like a political cabinet member today. A counselor might sometimes have been in line to succeed the king. 

Counselors in the Bible
-----------------------

Ahithophel was a counselor to David and Absalom. He gave advice that was so trustworthy it was as if it came directly from God ([2 Samuel 16:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:23)). The elders of Israel counseled King Rehoboam ([1 Kings 12:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:6)). So did Rehoboam's childhood friends (verses [7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:7-1Kgs12:8)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21)[8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:7-1Kgs12:8)), although his friends gave poor advice. The Bible mentions official counselors in Egypt ([Isaiah 19:11](https://ref.ly/Isa19:11)) and Babylon ([Daniel 3:2](https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21)[3](https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3)).

A wise person seeks counsel when making plans: "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." ([Proverbs 15:22](https://ref.ly/Prov15:22)). Counselors may be:

* one’s parents ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Prov1:8))
* older people ([Ezekiel 7:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:26))
* prophets ([2 Chronicles 25:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:16))
* wise men ([Jeremiah 18:18](https://ref.ly/Jer18:18))
* friends ([Proverbs 27:9](https://ref.ly/Prov27:9))

Some counselors are evil and give advice meant to deceive people ([Proverbs 12:5](https://ref.ly/Prov12:5)).

God as a Counselor
------------------

According to the Bible, God also counsels. He frustrates the counsel of the nations who oppose him ([Psalms 33:10](https://ref.ly/Ps33:10)). But, God's own counsel endures for many generations (verse [11](https://ref.ly/Ps33:11)). No one may counsel the Lord ([Isaiah 40:13](https://ref.ly/Isa40:13)). His chosen leader, the Messiah, is called “Wonderful Counselor” ([9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6)).

According to the New Testament, the Holy Spirit counsels or comforts believers ([John 14:16–17](https://ref.ly/John14:16-John14:17)). Christ sends the Holy Spirit to his people ([16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7)). The Holy Spirit, also called the Spirit of truth, bears witness to Christ ([15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26)). Jesus Christ, after he rose to heaven, is seen as a counselor in God’s heavenly court (described as an "advocate" in [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)).
