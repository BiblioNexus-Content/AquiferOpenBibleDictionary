## Ahimelech (id: 3449)

AHIMELECH
=========

1. A priest at Nob who helped David when he was running from Saul ([1 Samuel 21:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:9)). When David asked for food, all he had was the holy bread from the tabernacle (Jesus spoke about this in [Matthew 12:1](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8)–[8](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:8)). Doeg the Edomite told Saul what he saw, who ordered Ahimelech to be killed. But Saul’s guards did not want to kill a priest. Doeg killed Ahimelech and 84 other priests, along with their families and animals ([1 Samuel 22:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:19)). Only Abiathar, Ahimelech’s son, escaped and went to David for protection ([1 Samuel 22:20](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:20-1Sam22:23)–[23](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:20-1Sam22:23)). David wrote [Psalm 52](https://ref.ly/Ps52:1-Ps52:9) about what Doeg had done.
2. A Hittite who joined David’s fighting men during his escape from Saul ([1 Samuel 26:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:6)).
3. The son of Abiathar and grandson of his father, Ahimelech. He helped his father in the priesthood under King David ([2 Samuel 8:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17); [1 Chronicles 24:3, 5, 31](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3,1Chr24:5,1Chr24:31); compare with [1 Chronicles 18:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:16), where some translations call him Abimelech).
