Name given to the temple of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes in 168 BC when he turned the holy place into a shrine for the chief of the pagan gods of Greece ([2 Macc 6:2](https://ref.ly/2Macc6:2)). Jews were forced to abandon ancestral customs and could no longer observe God’s law. The desecration included temple prostitution, forced cannibalism, and humiliation for the Jews.
