## Maadiah (id: 6812)

MAADIAH\*
=========

Head of a priestly family who returned to Jerusalem after the exile ([Neh 12:5](https://ref.ly/Neh12:5), nlt mg) and whose house was headed by Piltai in the next generation during the days of Joiakim the high priest. He is called Moadiah in v [17](https://ref.ly/Neh12:17). He is perhaps identifiable with the priest Maaziah, who set his seal on Ezra’s covenant ([10:8](https://ref.ly/Neh10:8)).
