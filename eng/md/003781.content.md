## Melzar (id: 7040)

MELZAR
======

The steward responsible for the food given to Daniel ([Daniel 1:11, 16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:11,Dan1:16)). The Berean Standard Bible translates the word as a title, but the King James Version translates the word as a proper name. Most likely, Melzar is a Hebrew translation of a Babylonian title.

* **Associated Passages:** DAN 1:11; DAN 1:16
