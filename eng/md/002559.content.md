HERES
=====

1\. Region from which the Amorites were not expelled by the Israelites, known as Mt Heres ([Jgs 1:34–35](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:35), rsv “Har\-heres”). In [Joshua 19:41–42](https://ref.ly/Josh19:41-Josh19:42), Mt Heres is synonymous with the town of Ir\-shemesh (Beth\-shemesh).

2\. Ascent of Heres ([Jgs 8:13](https://ref.ly/Judg8:13), rsv; nlt “Heres Pass”). Though the text and the exact nature of the terrain is unclear, it was the place on the Jordan River from which Gideon returned after his victory over Zebah and Zalmunna.
