## Hagri (id: 5595)

HAGRI
=====

The father of Mibhar, according to [1 Chronicles 11:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:38). However, in the similar list found in [2 Samuel 23:36](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:36), the text says "Bani, the Gadite" instead of "Mibhar, son of Hagri." Because of textual difficulties in the 1 Chronicles passage, scholars think the reading in 2 Samuel is probably more accurate.
