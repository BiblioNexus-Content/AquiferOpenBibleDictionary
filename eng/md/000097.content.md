ADADAH
======

One of 30 cities given to the tribe of Judah when the Israelites divided up the land of Canaan. It was in the Negev, which is the southern desert region ([Joshua 15:22](https://ref.ly/Josh15:22)). In the Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament), the name is sometimes written as Ararah*,* or “Aroer” in [1 Samuel 30:28](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:28). It may be modern\-day Khirbet Ar’arah, located 12 miles (19 kilometers) south of Beersheba.
