## Feast of Trumpets (id: 8933)

FEAST OF TRUMPETS
=================

A holy day for the Israelites that marked the beginning of the fall feasts. It was a day of rest when no regular work was done. During this festival, the Israelites sounded trumpets to call for a time of remembrance, reflection, and preparation for the upcoming Day of Atonement. The festival was a time to remember God’s covenant with them, particularly the agreement made at Mount Sinai ([Leviticus 23:23–25](https://ref.ly/Lev23:23-Lev23:25)).
