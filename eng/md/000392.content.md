## Aphek (id: 3655)

APHEK
=====

1. A Canaanite city west of the Jordan River. It was conquered by Israel and later included in Ephraim’s territory ([Joshua 12:18](https://ref.ly/Josh12:18)). It was located near the source of the Yarkon River in the plain of Sharon. Aphek was later captured by the Philistines ([1 Samuel 4:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1); [29:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1)). In Roman times, Herod the Great rebuilt the city and named it Antipatris. It is mentioned in [Acts 23:31](https://ref.ly/Acts23:31). Its modern name is Ras el\-‘Ain. *See also* Antipatris.
2. A place in Phoenicia (modern Lebanon). It remained unconquered after Joshua’s campaigns ([Joshua 13:4](https://ref.ly/Josh13:4)). This Aphek was probably located near the source of the river Ibrahim, east of Byblos.
3. A town given to Asher’s tribe in the distribution of conquered cities ([Joshua 19:30](https://ref.ly/Josh19:30)). Asher’s tribe failed to drive out the pagan inhabitants ([Judges 1:31\)](https://ref.ly/Judg1:31). Here it is spelled “Aphik”. Aphek was located on the plain of Acco. This is the present site of Tell Kurdaneh near the source of the river Na’main.
4. A city east of the Jordan River. It is on the main highway between Damascus and the valley of Jezreel. The Syrian king Ben\-hadad was defeated by King Ahab of Israel. Ben\-hadad retreated into Aphek. Here a falling wall demolished the rest of his army ([1 Kings 20:26, 30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:26,1Kgs20:30)). A century later Elisha prophesied to King Joash of Israel that he would defeat the Syrians in the same city ([2 Kings 13:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:17)).
