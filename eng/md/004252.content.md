## Oracle (id: 7511)

ORACLE
======

An oracle is a divine message from God given through a spokesperson (like a prophet, priest, or king). Oracles usually announce blessings, give instructions, or declare judgments.

When Balak asked Balaam to speak a curse against Israel, Balaam instead spoke an oracle of blessing ([Numbers 24:3–16](https://ref.ly/Num24:3-Num24:16)). God instructed Moses through “living words” ([Acts 7:38](https://ref.ly/Acts7:38)). God trusted the Jewish people with these messages ([Romans 3:2](https://ref.ly/Rom3:2)). 

The book of Proverbs contains two wisdom oracles: one from Agur, who was Jakeh's son ([Proverbs 30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1)), and another from King Lemuel ([31:1](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1)). 

The Bible lists oracles of judgment delivered against kings Joram of Israel ([2 Kings 9:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:25)) and Joash of Judah ([2 Chronicles 24:27](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:27)). The prophets often spoke oracles against nations that did evil:

* Isaiah spoke oracles against Babylon ([Isaiah 13:1](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1); [21:1](https://ref.ly/Isa21:1))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Damascus ([17:1](https://ref.ly/Isa17:1))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Egypt ([19:1](https://ref.ly/Isa19:1))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Jerusalem ([22:1](https://ref.ly/Isa22:1))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Moab ([15:1](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Philistia ([14:28](https://ref.ly/Isa14:28))
* Isaiah spoke oracles against Tyre ([23:1](https://ref.ly/Isa23:1))
* Nahum spoke oracles against Nineveh ([Nahum 1:1](https://ref.ly/Nah1:1))
* Habakkuk spoke oracles against Judah ([Habakkuk 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hab1:1))
* Malachi spoke oracles against Israel ([Malachi 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mal1:1))

Sometimes false prophets gave false and misleading oracles ([Lamentations 2:14](https://ref.ly/Lam2:14)).
