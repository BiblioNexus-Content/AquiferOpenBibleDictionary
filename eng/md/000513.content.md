## Asaph (id: 3779)

ASAPH
=====

1. Berechiah’s son, who was an important tabernacle musician during King David’s reign ([1 Chronicles 6:31–32, 39](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:32,1Chr6:39)). David appointed a lead singer, Heman, and Ethan. With them, he appointed Asaph to sound bronze cymbals during the ceremony when the ark was brought to the new tabernacle ([1 Chronicles 15:1–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:1-1Chr15:19)). David appointed Asaph to serve "by giving constant praise and thanks to the Lord God of Israel" ([1 Chronicles 16:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:4-1Chr16:5), The Living Bible). Asaph was to lead Israel in a special psalm of praise ([1 Chronicles 16:7–36](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:7-1Chr16:36)).

    Along with his relatives, Asaph ministered daily before the ark ([1 Chronicles 16:37](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:37); [25:6, 9](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:6,1Chr25:9); [1 Esdras 1:15](https://ref.ly/1Esd1:15); [5:27, 59](https://ref.ly/1Esd5:27,1Esd5:59)). He was also described as David’s private prophet ([1 Chronicles 25:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:2)). Asaph’s name appears in the superscriptions of [Psalms 50](https://ref.ly/Ps50:1-Ps50:23) and [73–83](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps83:18) and in the guild he established, called "the sons of Asaph" ([1 Chronicles 25:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1); [2 Chronicles 35:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:15); [Ezra 2:41](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:41); [Nehemiah 7:44](https://ref.ly/Neh7:44); [11:22](https://ref.ly/Neh11:22)).

2. Joah’s father. Joah was the recorder (court historian or royal scribe) in King Hezekiah’s administration ([2 Kings 18:18, 27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:18,2Kgs18:27); [Isaiah 36:22](https://ref.ly/Isa36:22)).
3. Temple guard or gatekeeper, seemingly the same person as Ebiasaph ([1 Chronicles 9:18](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:18)).
4. A keeper of the king’s forest in Palestine under Artaxerxes I Longimanus ([Nehemiah 2:8](https://ref.ly/Neh2:8)). Nehemiah asked this Asaph for timber to rebuild the wall, gates, and structures of Jerusalem.
