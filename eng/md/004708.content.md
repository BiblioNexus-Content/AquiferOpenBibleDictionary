## Red Sea (id: 7971)

RED SEA
=======

The Red Sea is a narrow stretch of water that connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. It is about 2,172 kilometers (1,350 miles) long and 290 kilometers (180 miles) wide. The Red Sea lies between Africa and Asia. On the east side is the Arabian Peninsula. On the west side are the countries of Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia.

At the northwest end, the Sinai Peninsula extends into the sea. This creates the Gulf of Suez to the west and the Gulf of Aqaba to the east. The city of Suez is at the Gulf of Suez's northwestern end. The Suez Canal connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. At the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba are the ports of Eilat (in Israel) and Aqaba (in Jordan). The Red Sea is full of fish and other sea creatures that could provide food for people living in this region. However, there are few cities, roads, or farmable land along its shores.

Biblical Names and References
-----------------------------

The Hebrew Old Testament refers to the Red Sea as the “Sea of Reeds” or “Sea of Rushes.” Most English translations use "Red Sea," following the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). The body of water referenced in the Bible might be different from what is known today as the Red Sea. The New Testament mentions the Red Sea only in Stephen's speech before the Jewish council ([Acts 7:36](https://ref.ly/Acts7:36)) and in the “heroes of faith” chapter ([Hebrews 11:29](https://ref.ly/Heb11:29)).

Crossing the Red Sea
--------------------

One of the most celebrated events in Jewish history is the crossing of the Red Sea during the exodus from Egypt. The Jewish people still remember it today. The exact location of the crossing is debated by scholars. What is clear is that the water was too deep to walk across and too wide to swim across. It was deep enough to cover and drown the entire Egyptian army.

When the Israelites reached the sea, they were trapped between the water and the pursuing Egyptian army, which was the most powerful military force of that time. God saved the Israelites by using a strong east wind to create a dry path through the sea ([Exodus 14:10–31](https://ref.ly/Exod14:10-Exod14:31)). The Egyptians had the best army in the world at that time.

When God caused the waters to close over the Egyptian forces, the Israelites were completely freed from Egyptian control. The Israelites celebrated this victory with songs ([Exodus 15:1–21](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:21)). This event was often remembered when telling about God's help for Israel (see [Joshua 4:23](https://ref.ly/Josh4:23); [24:6–7](https://ref.ly/Josh24:6-Josh24:7); [Psalms 106:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps106:7-Ps106:9); [136:13–15](https://ref.ly/Ps136:13-Ps136:15)). Even the people of Jericho heard what God did at the Red Sea and were afraid ([Joshua 2:9–10](https://ref.ly/Josh2:9-Josh2:10)).

Journey Through the Wilderness
------------------------------

After leaving Egypt, the Israelites traveled along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Suez for some distance. After they left Elim, they camped beside the sea ([Numbers 33:9–11](https://ref.ly/Num33:9-Num33:11)). Then they turned inland toward Mount Sinai.

From Sinai, they traveled northeast, following the Gulf of Aqaba as closely as possible. They likely reached the Red Sea at Ezion\-geber ([Numbers 33:35](https://ref.ly/Num33:35)). They failed to enter Canaan from Kadesh\-barnea and were defeated at Hormah. After that, they turned south to where Mount Seir comes close to the Gulf of Aqaba (compare [Deuteronomy 2:8](https://ref.ly/Deut2:8)).

**The Red Sea in Israel's Later History**
-----------------------------------------

The Red Sea is on the southern border of the promised land ([Exodus 23:31](https://ref.ly/Exod23:31)). Solomon’s kingdom extended to the Gulf of Aqaba, where he built a fleet of ships at Ezion\-geber near Eloth. These ships sailed to Ophir, bringing back gold and other treasures ([1 Kings 9:26–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28); compare [2 Chronicles 8:17–18](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:17-2Chr8:18)). Later, Jehoshaphat tried to do the same. But his ships were destroyed at Ezion\-geber ([1 Kings 22:48](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:48); [2 Chronicles 20:36–37](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:36-2Chr20:37)).
