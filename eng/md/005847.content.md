## Worm (id: 9093)

WORM
====

A worm is a small, soft\-bodied creature. In the Bible, the word usually means insect larvae, often maggots (the young of flies).

Maggots are mentioned in stories where they feed on:

* spoiled manna ([Exodus 16:19–20](https://ref.ly/Exod16:19-Exod16:20)),

* corpses ([Job 21:26](https://ref.ly/Job21:26); [Isaiah 14:11](https://ref.ly/Isa14:11)), or
* open wounds ([Job 7:5](https://ref.ly/Job7:5)).

[Mark 9:48](https://ref.ly/Mark9:48) refers to a maggot that eats dead flesh. In [Acts 12:23](https://ref.ly/Acts12:23), King Herod suffers a fatal disease caused by worms. Sometimes “worm” means the young of other insects ([Isaiah 51:8](https://ref.ly/Isa51:8)). 

In [Deuteronomy 28:39](https://ref.ly/Deut28:39) and [Jonah 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jonah4:7) the vine weevil *(Cochylis ambiguella)* is likely meant. This pest damages vines by boring into their stems. 

Calling a person a “worm” is a way of showing extreme humility or shame ([Job 25:6](https://ref.ly/Job25:6); [Psalm 22:6](https://ref.ly/Ps22:6)).
