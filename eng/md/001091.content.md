## Brook of Egypt (id: 4347)

BROOK OF EGYPT
==============

Natural border between the Negev Desert area of Israel and the Sinai Peninsula, about 50 miles (80\.5 kilometers) southwest of Gaza. The brook of Egypt, modern Wadi el\-Arish, flows only during the rainy season ([Nm 34:5](https://ref.ly/Num34:5); [Jos 15:4, 47](https://ref.ly/Josh15:4,Josh15:47); [1 Kgs 8:65](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:65); [2 Kgs 24:7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:7); [2 Chr 7:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:8); [Is 27:12](https://ref.ly/Isa27:12); [Ez 47:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:19); [48:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:28)). A different Hebrew word, signifying an ever\-flowing river, appears in [Genesis 15:18](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18), where God spelled out the boundaries of the Promised Land to the patriarch Abraham. That reference may be to the easternmost branch of the Nile (the Pelusiac), which flows into the Mediterranean Sea near modern Port Said, and to the line of ancient fortifications marking Egypt’s border.
