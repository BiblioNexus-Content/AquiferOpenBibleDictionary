## Guard, Gate of the (id: 5543)

GUARD, Gate of the
==================

Gate located in the north or northwest part of Jerusalem ([Neh 12:38–39](https://ref.ly/Neh12:38-Neh12:39), kjv “prison gate”), although unrelated to the courtyard of the guard ([3:25](https://ref.ly/Neh3:25)), which was connected to the palace. Perhaps it was the same as the Muster Gate. *See* Jerusalem.
