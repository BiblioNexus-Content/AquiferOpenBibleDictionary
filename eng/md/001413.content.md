## Corruption, Mount of (id: 4661)

CORRUPTION, Mount of
====================

Southern end of the Mt of Olives, called “corruption” because King Solomon built idols there for his foreign wives ([1 Kgs 11:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:7); [2 Kgs 23:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:13)). The term is possibly an ironic play on the Hebrew word for “anointing.” The site may have originally been called the “Mount of Anointing” because oil from the many olive groves on its slopes was used in consecration ceremonies. *See* Olives, Mount of.
