## Brother (id: 4353)

BROTHER
=======

The term "brother" can refer to:

* A man or boy in relation to his siblings
* A close male friend
* A fellow member of the same race, creed, profession, or organization.

**What Does "Brother" Mean in the Old Testament?**
--------------------------------------------------

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word for “brother” refers to male children who share at least one parent. Joseph and Benjamin were both children of Jacob and Rachel ([Genesis 35:24](https://ref.ly/Gen35:24)). Still, Jacob's other sons were also Joseph’s brothers ([Genesis 42:6](https://ref.ly/Gen42:6)). 

The love Joseph had for Benjamin was special and is not always shared between brothers. Cain killed his brother Abel ([Genesis 4:8](https://ref.ly/Gen4:8)). Esau hated his brother, Jacob ([27:41](https://ref.ly/Gen27:41)). A brother can be a bad influence ([Deuteronomy 13:6](https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:7)–[7](https://ref.ly/Deut13:6-Deut13:7)), but ideally he helps in times of need ([Proverbs 17:17](https://ref.ly/Prov17:17)). The law of levirate marriage meant that if a man died leaving a childless widow, his brother had to marry her and have children to continue his brother's family name ([Deuteronomy 25:5](https://ref.ly/Deut25:5)).

David called Jonathan his “brother” even though they were not related ([2 Samuel 1:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:26)). A fellow Israelite could be called brother. The relationship came with certain duties: no one could charge interest on their brother nor enslave him ([Leviticus 25:35](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:43)–[43](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35-Lev25:43)).

What Does "Brother" Mean in the New Testament?
----------------------------------------------

In the New Testament, the Greek word describes natural brothers, like Andrew and Peter ([John 1:41](https://ref.ly/John1:41)). Jesus had four brothers ([Mark 6:3](https://ref.ly/Mark6:3)). (Roman Catholics believe they were Jesus's cousins, but the Greek does not use the word for cousin.) Jesus’s brothers did not believe in him at first ([John 7:5](https://ref.ly/John7:5)). Still, after the resurrection, they joined the Christian community ([Acts 1:14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:14)). Jesus taught that his disciples had one Father (God) and were all brothers ([Matthew 23:8](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:9)). He also was their brother ([Matthew 28:10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:10)).

Early Christians called each other "brother" ([Acts 9:17](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17); [Colossians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Col1:1)). Twice, the Christian community is called “the brotherhood” ([1 Peter 2:17](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:17); [5:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:9)). Being a part of the Christian brotherhood comes with certain duties:

* Controlling sexual desires ([1 Thessalonians 4:6](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:6))
* Providing material help when needed ([James 2:15](https://ref.ly/Jas2:15-Jas2:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Jas2:15-Jas2:16))
* Avoiding cause for offence ([Romans 14:13](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13)).
* Christians should not “go to law” or sue their brothers ([1 Corinthians 6:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:5-1Cor6:6)–[6](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:5-1Cor6:6))
* They must resolve their problems either personally in the church ([Matthew 18:15](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:17)–[17](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15-Matt18:17))

A Christian's relationship with their brother is significant because they cannot worship God if he is not in harmony with his brother ([Matthew 5:23](https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24)–[24](https://ref.ly/Matt5:23-Matt5:24)).
