## Adida (id: 3377)

ADIDA
=====

A town strengthened by Simon Maccabeus ([1 Maccabees 12:38](https://ref.ly/1Macc12:38); [13:13](https://ref.ly/1Macc13:13)). Adida was in the foothills of southern Judea four miles (6\.4 kilometers) east of Lydda between the coastal plains of the Mediterranean and the central highlands. Adida is likely the same place as Hadid ([Nehemiah 11:34](https://ref.ly/Neh11:34)).
