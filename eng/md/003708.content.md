## Mason, Masonry (id: 6967)

MASON, MASONRY
==============

A worker in the craft of brick and stonework. The mason prepared stone from the quarry for use in building. In the early days of Israel, they hired masons from Phoenicia ([2 Samuel 5:11](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:11); [1 Kings 5:17–18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:17-1Kgs5:18); [1 Chronicles 14:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:1)). But later, Israelite masons did their own work ([2 Kings 12:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:12); [22:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:6); [2 Chronicles 24:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:12); [Ezra 3:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:7)).
