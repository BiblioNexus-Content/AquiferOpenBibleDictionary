## Bathe, Bathing (id: 4029)

BATHE, BATHING
==============

To cleanse as with water or to wash oneself. In the Bible the terms “bathing” and “washing” translate, often interchangeably, several different words. One Old Testament passage uses one Hebrew word for cleaning clothes, and another for washing other objects, including the body ([Leviticus 15:8–12](https://ref.ly/Lev15:8-Lev15:12)).

Israel’s dry climate and scarcity of water discouraged bathing except where a stream or pool was available ([2 Kings 5:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:10); [John 9:7](https://ref.ly/John9:7)). Yet people still washed babies at birth ([Ezekiel 16:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:4)), dead bodies in preparation for burial ([Acts 9:37](https://ref.ly/Acts9:37)), and sheep for their shearing ([Song of Solomon 6:6](https://ref.ly/Song6:6)). Frequent bathing of the whole body was probably reserved for the rich ([Exodus 2:5](https://ref.ly/Exod2:5)). But the prevalence of dust made frequent washing of the face, hands, and feet necessary ([Genesis 18:4](https://ref.ly/Gen18:4); [19:2](https://ref.ly/Gen19:2); [24:32](https://ref.ly/Gen24:32); [43:24](https://ref.ly/Gen43:24); [Judges 19:21](https://ref.ly/Judg19:21); [Song of Solomon 5:3](https://ref.ly/Song5:3)). Good grooming for the privileged demanded washing of one’s body before anointing with oil ([Ruth 3:3](https://ref.ly/Ruth3:3); [2 Samuel 12:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:20); [Ezekiel 23:41](https://ref.ly/Ezek23:41)). A good host provided water for a guest’s feet ([Genesis 18:4](https://ref.ly/Gen18:4); [Judges 19:21](https://ref.ly/Judg19:21); [Luke 7:44](https://ref.ly/Luke7:44); [John 13:4–5](https://ref.ly/John13:4-John13:5)). To wash someone’s feet was the task of a servant. For anyone else to do so was a sign of humility ([1 Samuel 25:41](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:41); [Luke 7:44–47](https://ref.ly/Luke7:44-Luke7:47); [John 13:3–16](https://ref.ly/John13:3-John13:16); [1 Timothy 5:10](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:10)).

Most biblical references to washing or bathing deal with ritual cleansing. Priests and Levites were required to wash their clothes and faces, and sometimes bodies, before approaching the altar and on ceremonial occasions ([Exodus 29:4](https://ref.ly/Exod29:4); [30:19–21](https://ref.ly/Exod30:19-Exod30:21); [40:7, 12, 30–32](https://ref.ly/Exod40:7,Exod40:12,Exod40:30-Exod40:32); [Numbers 8:21](https://ref.ly/Num8:21)). Before a slain animal was sacrificed, its legs and intestines were washed ([Leviticus 1:9, 13](https://ref.ly/Lev1:9,Lev1:13); [8:21](https://ref.ly/Lev8:21); [9:14](https://ref.ly/Lev9:14)). Anyone who was once unclean had to wash his or her clothes and bathe to be ritually pure ([Leviticus 14:8–10](https://ref.ly/Lev14:8-Lev14:10); [15:5–11, 21–27](https://ref.ly/Lev15:5-Lev15:11,Lev15:21-Lev15:27)). For example, a leper who was healed or someone who had experienced a genital discharge would be considered unclean and need to wash and bathe. Any garment that became polluted had to be ceremonially cleansed ([Leviticus 6:27](https://ref.ly/Lev6:27); [13:54](https://ref.ly/Lev13:54)).

“Washing” is also used figuratively for a cleansing from sin ([Psalm 51:2](https://ref.ly/Ps51:2); [Isaiah 1:16](https://ref.ly/Isa1:16); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4); [Jeremiah 2:22](https://ref.ly/Jer2:22); [4:14](https://ref.ly/Jer4:14); [1 Corinthians 6:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:11); [Hebrews 10:22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22)).
