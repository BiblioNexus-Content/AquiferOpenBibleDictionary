## Nobah (Place) (id: 7416)

NOBAH (Place)
=============

1. A town east of the Jordan river. It was previously called Kenath. The town was given to Nobah the Manassite as his inheritance, and he renamed it after himself ([Numbers 32:42](https://ref.ly/Num32:42)). Nobah might be the same place as Kanatha, which was the easternmost city of the Decapolis during the time when the Romans ruled the area.

    *See also* Decapolis; Kanatha.

2. A place near the Gadite town of Jogbehah east of the Jordan River. It was near the place the judge Gideon ambushed the Midianites ([Judges 8:11](https://ref.ly/Judg8:11)).
