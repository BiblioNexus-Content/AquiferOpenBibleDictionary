## Zipporah (id: 9242)

ZIPPORAH
========

The wife of Moses and mother of his sons, Gershom and Eliezer ([Exodus 2:21](https://ref.ly/Exod2:21)). Zipporah is listed as the daughter of Reuel ([Exodus 2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18)). But, Reuel was probably the father of Hobab, who was the father of Zipporah ([Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29); called Jethro in [Exodus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1); [4:18](https://ref.ly/Exod4:18)). So, Reuel would have been Zipporah's grandfather. 

Zipporah circumcised Gershom to prevent Moses’ death before his return to Egypt ([Exodus 4:25](https://ref.ly/Exod4:25)). Apparently at that point Zipporah and the children left Moses and went back to live with her father, returning later during the time Israel wandered in the wilderness ([Exodus 18:2](https://ref.ly/Exod18:2)).
