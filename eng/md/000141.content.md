## Adriel (id: 3401)

ADRIEL
======

Barzillai's son, to whom Saul gave Adriel his daughter Merab in marriage. Saul did this even though she had been promised to David ([1 Samuel 18:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19)). Later, King David gave Adriel's five sons to the Gibeonites. The Gibeonites killed these sons as punishment against Saul's family ([2 Samuel 21:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:9)).
