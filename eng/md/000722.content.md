## Banquet (id: 3991)

BANQUET
=======

A grand ceremonial meal held to celebrate an important event or person. It also symbolizes the future feast that Christ will host in the kingdom of God. 

In biblical times, banqueting and feasting were central to social and religious life. Alongside the religious feasts set by Mosaic law, people celebrated with banquets on various joyful or significant occasions, such as: 

* make formal agreements ([Genesis 26:30](https://ref.ly/Gen26:30); [31:54](https://ref.ly/Gen31:54); [Exodus 24:11](https://ref.ly/Exod24:11))
* weddings ([Genesis 29:22](https://ref.ly/Gen29:22); [Judges 14:10](https://ref.ly/Judg14:10))
* harvest ([Judges 9:27](https://ref.ly/Judg9:27); [Ruth 3:1](https://ref.ly/Ruth3:1-Ruth3:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Ruth3:1-Ruth3:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Ruth3:1-Ruth3:3))
* shearing sheep ([1 Samuel 25:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:11); [2 Samuel 13:23](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23-2Sam13:29)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23-2Sam13:29)[29](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23-2Sam13:29))
* welcoming guests ([Genesis 19:3](https://ref.ly/Gen19:3))
* weaning a child ([Genesis 21:8](https://ref.ly/Gen21:8))
* ceremonies to make someone king or queen ([1 Kings 1:9, 19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9,1Kgs1:19-1Kgs1:25)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9)[25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:9,1Kgs1:19-1Kgs1:25))
* state events ([Esther 1:3](https://ref.ly/Esth1:3-Esth1:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Esth1:3-Esth1:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Esth1:3-Esth1:9); [2:18](https://ref.ly/Esth2:18); [5:4](https://ref.ly/Esth5:4-Esth5:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Esth5:4-Esth5:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Esth5:4-Esth5:8))
* as well as for many other reasons

Banquet customs from ancient Middle Eastern cultures are depicted in the Bible and other ancient texts. Objects found by people who study ancient cultures often show scenes of banquets. The process of hosting a banquet in biblical texts, such as [Proverbs 9:2](https://ref.ly/Prov9:2-Prov9:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Prov9:2-Prov9:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Prov9:2-Prov9:5), [Matthew 22:1](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14), and [Luke 14:15](https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24)[24,](https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24) is also known from the legend of King Keret in Ugaritic literature: 

1. preparation of the foods
2. sending messengers with the invitation and announcement that all is ready
3. presentation of food and wine in order

The prophet Amos portrays grand feasts and shows the main eating customs ([Amos 6:4](https://ref.ly/Amos6:4-Amos6:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Amos6:4-Amos6:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Amos6:4-Amos6:6)). Meals were typically enjoyed while reclining on a couch before a table ([Esther 1:6](https://ref.ly/Esth1:6); [Ezekiel 23:41](https://ref.ly/Ezek23:41); [Amos 6:4](https://ref.ly/Amos6:4); [Matthew 9:10](https://ref.ly/Matt9:10); [Luke 7:49](https://ref.ly/Luke7:49); [14:10, 15](https://ref.ly/Luke14:10,Luke14:15)).

Banquet imagery is significant in both the Old and New Testaments as a symbol of the kingdom of God. Isaiah predicts a grand banquet following the judgment of nations and the deliverance of Israel, where the Lord reigns over his people ([Isaiah 24:23](https://ref.ly/Isa24:23)). The beginning of that reign is celebrated by a huge banquet with all people ([Isaiah 25:6](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6-Isa25:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6-Isa25:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6-Isa25:8); compare [Luke 13:29](https://ref.ly/Luke13:29)). The Old Testament’s animal sacrifice meals point to this great feast where there will be no more death or sorrow for God’s people ([Isaiah 25:7](https://ref.ly/Isa25:7); compare [Revelation 21:4](https://ref.ly/Rev21:4)). The new covenant banquet points to the future when the redeemed will share fine wine ([Isaiah 25:6](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6)) with Christ in God's kingdom ([Luke 22:14](https://ref.ly/Luke22:14-Luke22:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke22:14-Luke22:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:14-Luke22:20)). Participating in the Lord’s Supper (Communion) is a way for Christians to anticipate this future feast.

This final banquet in God's kingdom is also described as a wedding feast. While everything is prepared and many are invited, only a few are chosen ([Matthew 22:1](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)). The church eagerly awaits the marriage feast of the Lamb ([Revelation 19:7](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7-Rev19:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7-Rev19:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7-Rev19:9)).
