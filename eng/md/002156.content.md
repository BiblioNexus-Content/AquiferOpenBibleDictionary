## Genealogy (id: 5413)

GENEALOGY
=========

Genealogy is the study of family history, tracing ancestry backward or forward for a nation, tribe, family, or individual. The Hebrews were not the only ancient people interested in keeping genealogical records. The Sumerian king list from the third millennium BC records early Mesopotamian rulers. In Babylonian records, the word “son” often meant “descendant of.” King Tirhakah of Egypt called Sesostris III his “father” around 685 BC, even though Sesostris III lived 1,200 years earlier. Greeks and Romans also kept genealogical records. However, biblical genealogies, especially those in Genesis and [1 Chronicles 1–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1-1Chr9:44), are unique in ancient Near Eastern literature. Only at the start of the Islamic age do we find such extensive genealogical records. Even today, among tribal Semites like Arab nomads, there is a strong interest in genealogy. It is common for an Arab to accurately recite the names of ancestors going back ten or 15 generations, covering several hundred years.

Terms Used
----------

The word "genealogy" appears only once as a noun in the Hebrew Old Testament ([Nehemiah 7:5](https://ref.ly/Neh7:5)). It refers to a list of those who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile. The verb form of the word appears 20 times in 1—2 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. The terms "generations" and "book of the generations," used in Genesis and other parts of the Old Testament, express the same idea. The New Testament uses similar terms in [1 Timothy 1:4](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:4) and [Titus 3:9](https://ref.ly/Titus3:9) ("genealogies") and [Matthew 1:1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1), which refers to the "book of the genealogy" of Jesus Christ.

Purpose of Genealogical Records
-------------------------------

Keeping genealogical records in ancient Israel was important for several reasons. God's promise of land to Abraham and his descendants required these records to establish and preserve land ownership. A genealogical record proved a legitimate claim to ancestral property. Genealogies were also crucial for maintaining the exclusive priesthood established by Mosaic law. During Josephus's time, every priest had to prove his lineage.

People kept genealogical records to ensure the right of royal succession in Judah through David's family. The belief that the Messiah would come from David's lineage made these records even more important.

These family records also served other purposes, such as assigning military duty based on families ([Numbers 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Num1:2-Num1:3)). Tribes and families determined positions in camp and during the march from Egypt ([Numbers 2:2, 17](https://ref.ly/Num2:2,Num2:17); [10:11–28](https://ref.ly/Num10:11-Num10:28)). God's blessings were passed from one family member to their descendants ([Genesis 27](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:46)). The focus on keeping the congregation pure ([Deuteronomy 7:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1-Deut7:4); [23:1–8](https://ref.ly/Deut23:1-Deut23:8)) required complete family records, especially after the exile. Ezra and Nehemiah emphasized racial purity and removed foreign elements from the people ([Ezra 2:59–63](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:59-Ezra2:63); [10:9–44](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:9-Ezra10:44); [Nehemiah 13:23–28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:28)). Written proof of pure descent became crucial, and interest in compiling genealogies grew after the exile.

Lineage was usually traced through the male family members. Females were rarely mentioned, such as Sarah and Milcah in [Genesis 11:29](https://ref.ly/Gen11:29), Rebekah in [Genesis 22:23](https://ref.ly/Gen22:23), and the daughters of Zelophehad in [Numbers 26:33–27:11](https://ref.ly/Num26:33-Num27:11) regarding property inheritance. Matthew mentions three women: 

* Tamar
* Rahab
* Ruth

He also refers to Bathsheba in the second group (see discussion below).

Principal Genealogical Lists in the Bible
-----------------------------------------

The main sources of genealogical information in the Old Testament are: 

* Genesis
* Numbers
* 2 Samuel
* 1 Kings
* 1–2 Chronicles

These books have the most genealogical content in the Bible, Ezra, and Nehemiah. The genealogies of Jesus Christ in [Matthew 1](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:25) and [Luke 3](https://ref.ly/Luke3:1-Luke3:38) are the only New Testament records. Together, they provide a genealogical record from Adam to Christ.

The main genealogical lists in the Bible are grouped by historical periods:

### Before the Flood

There are three lists from this period: 

1. The first, found in [Genesis 4:17–22](https://ref.ly/Gen4:17-Gen4:22), traces Cain's descendants through seven generations. It explains the hereditary origin of certain jobs and crafts.
2. The second, [Genesis 4:25–26](https://ref.ly/Gen4:25-Gen4:26), begins the account of Seth's descendants. Seth is Adam's faithful son, in contrast to Cain's ungodly line.
3. The third list, [Genesis 5:1–32](https://ref.ly/Gen5:1-Gen5:32) (see [1 Chronicles 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1-1Chr1:4)), traces Adam's descendants through Seth down to Noah and his sons during the Flood.

### From Noah to Abraham

[Genesis 10:1–32](https://ref.ly/Gen10:1-Gen10:32) (see also [1 Chronicles 1:4–23](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:4-1Chr1:23)) is often called the "table of nations." It lists the nations that came from Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. [Genesis 11:10–26](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:26) (see also [1 Chronicles 1:24–27](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:24-1Chr1:27)) follows Shem's descendants up to Abraham's time. [Genesis 11:27–30](https://ref.ly/Gen11:27-Gen11:30) (see also [Genesis 22:20–24](https://ref.ly/Gen22:20-Gen22:24)) lists the descendants of Nahor, Abraham's brother.

### From Abraham to the Descent into Egypt

The descendants of Abraham through Hagar, Sarah, and Keturah are listed in [Genesis 16:15](https://ref.ly/Gen16:15), [21:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen21:1-Gen21:3), and [25:1–4](https://ref.ly/Gen25:1-Gen25:4). These passages introduce the Arabs as Abraham's descendants (see [1 Chronicles 1:28–34](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:28-1Chr1:34)). [Genesis 19:37–38](https://ref.ly/Gen19:37-Gen19:38) connects the Moabites and Ammonites to Abraham through his nephew Lot. 

An important genealogical list from this period details the descendants of Jacob. It includes the parentage, birth, and naming of the founders of the 12 tribes of Israel ([Genesis 29:31–30:24](https://ref.ly/Gen29:31-Gen30:24); [35:16–26](https://ref.ly/Gen35:16-Gen35:26)). Esau is recognized as the ancestor of the Edomites, with his Edomite descendants traced through his three wives ([Genesis 26:34](https://ref.ly/Gen26:34); [36:1–43](https://ref.ly/Gen36:1-Gen36:43); [1 Chronicles 1:35–54](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:35-1Chr1:54)). The list of Jacob’s family when he entered Egypt, totaling 70 members, is found in [Genesis 46:1–27](https://ref.ly/Gen46:1-Gen46:27) (see [Exodus 6:14–16](https://ref.ly/Exod6:14-Exod6:16); [Numbers 26:1–51](https://ref.ly/Num26:1-Num26:51); [1 Chronicles 2–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr8:40)). A partial list of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi is in [Exodus 6:14–25](https://ref.ly/Exod6:14-Exod6:25). The main purpose of this genealogy is to establish Aaron and Moses as members of Levi’s tribe.

### From the Exodus to the Conquest of Canaan

While the tribes were still in the desert after leaving Egypt, a census counted the total number of Israelites ([Numbers 1:4–54](https://ref.ly/Num1:4-Num1:54); [2:2–33](https://ref.ly/Num2:2-Num2:33)). During this time, a genealogy of Aaron's family was compiled, and a separate census counted the Levites ([Numbers 3:1–39](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num3:39)). A list of the 12 spies who explored the land and the tribes they represented is in [Numbers 13:4–16](https://ref.ly/Num13:4-Num13:16); the most important names are Caleb and Joshua. Near the end of the wilderness journey, another census was ordered; the total number was about the same as the first census almost 40 years earlier ([Numbers 26:4–51, 57–62](https://ref.ly/Num26:4-Num26:51,Num26:57-Num26:62)). As the tribes neared the promised land, a list was prepared of the tribal representatives who would help divide the land ([Numbers 34:16–29](https://ref.ly/Num34:16-Num34:29)).

### Period of the Kings

During the monarchy, which lasted over 400 years, the only important genealogical records are about David. His descendants include 20 rulers who reigned over Judah until the Babylonians conquered the nation in 586 BC (1—2 Kings; see also [1 Chronicles 11:1—2 Chronicles 36:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:1-2Chr36:21)). A list of David’s children is in [2 Samuel 3:2–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:2-2Sam3:5) and [5:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:14-2Sam5:16) (see also [1 Chronicles 3:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:1-1Chr3:9); [14:4–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:4-1Chr14:7)). 

David's elite soldiers, known as mighty men, are named in [2 Samuel 23:8–39](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8-2Sam23:39) (see also [1 Chronicles 11:10–47](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:10-1Chr11:47)). The recruits who joined him at Ziklag are listed in [1 Chronicles 12:1–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:1-1Chr12:22). The musicians and doorkeepers who served when the ark was brought to Jerusalem are named in [1 Chronicles 15:1–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:1-1Chr15:24) (see also [1 Chronicles 16:5–6, 37–43](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5-1Chr16:6,1Chr16:37-1Chr16:43)). David’s organization of the kingdom, including the Levites, priests, singers, porters, other officials, and military officers, is detailed in [1 Chronicles 23–27](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:1-1Chr27:34). Despite the literary activity during Solomon's reign, the only preserved genealogical record from that time is of Solomon’s princes and 12 officers ([1 Kings 4:1–19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:1-1Kgs4:19)). The genealogy of one prophet goes back four generations ([Zephaniah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:1)).

### The Postexilic Period

During the period after the exile in Babylon, keeping genealogical records became very important. This was mainly due to Ezra and Nehemiah, who wanted to maintain racial purity and remove foreign influences from the community. A list of exiles who returned with Zerubbabel is in [Ezra 2:1–70](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:1-Ezra2:70) (see also [Nehemiah 7:6–73](https://ref.ly/Neh7:6-Neh7:73) for the same list). A list of those who returned with Ezra is in [Ezra 8:1–20](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:1-Ezra8:20). Ezra's own family history is recorded in [Ezra 7:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:5). 

There is a list of Jews who married foreign women, including priests, Levites, singers, porters, and other Israelites ([Ezra 10:18–44](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:18-Ezra10:44)). [Nehemiah 8:4–7](https://ref.ly/Neh8:4-Neh8:7) names the Levites and others who helped Ezra when he read the law to the public. Nehemiah also lists those who took part in sealing the covenant ([Nehemiah 10:1–27](https://ref.ly/Neh10:1-Neh10:27)) and those who lived in Jerusalem and other cities ([11:3–36](https://ref.ly/Neh11:3-Neh11:36)). His interest in the priesthood is shown in: 

* The list of priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel ([Nehemiah 12:1–9](https://ref.ly/Neh12:1-Neh12:9))
* The high priests from Jeshua to Jaddua ([Nehemiah 12:10–11](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10-Neh12:11))
* The heads of priestly families ([Nehemiah 12:12–21](https://ref.ly/Neh12:12-Neh12:21))
* The Levites and porters who served under the high priest ([Nehemiah 12:22–26](https://ref.ly/Neh12:22-Neh12:26))
* The princes and priests present at the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 12:31–42](https://ref.ly/Neh12:31-Neh12:42))

The last genealogical record to mention is the genealogy from Adam to Saul ([1 Chronicles 1–8](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:1-1Chr8:40)), the longest genealogical section in the Bible. It belongs with the genealogies compiled during the period after the exile in Babylon. An unknown chronicler, possibly Ezra, prepared this list around 400 BC using available records and documents. His goal was to preserve the nation's pure lineage and emphasize that the nation's well\-being depended on following God's law.

### The New Testament Period

The only important genealogies in the New Testament are about Jesus Christ in [Matthew 1:1–17](https://ref.ly/Matt1:1-Matt1:17) and [Luke 3:23–38](https://ref.ly/Luke3:23-Luke3:38).
