## Ijon (id: 5995)

IJON
====

Town assigned to Naphtali’s tribe in the extreme north of Palestine. Some identify it with Tell ed\-Dibbon between the Litani River and Mt Hermon, but this is disputed. Ijon was one of the towns taken by Ben\-hadad of Damascus during Baasha’s reign (c. 900 BC; [1 Kgs 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:20); [2 Chr 16:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:4)). Tiglath\-pileser III of Assyria captured the town and deported its people during Pekah’s reign (c. 733 BC; [2 Kgs 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)).
