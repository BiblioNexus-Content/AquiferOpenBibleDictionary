## Zelophehad (id: 9174)

ZELOPHEHAD
==========

Zelophehad was the son of Hepher from the tribe of Manasseh. Zelophehad had five daughters but no sons ([Numbers 26:33](https://ref.ly/Num26:33)). Because Zelophehad had no sons, his daughters asked Moses to give them the inheritance of their father ([27:1](https://ref.ly/Num27:1)). Moses made a ruling that daughters should receive the inheritance in such cases. But, the daughters must marry men from within their own tribe so that the tribal allotments would remain unchanged ([Numbers 27:7](https://ref.ly/Num27:7); [36:2](https://ref.ly/Num36:2); [Joshua 17:3](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3)).
