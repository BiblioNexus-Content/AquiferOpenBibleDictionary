## Agag (id: 3417)

AGAG
====

1. The name of an Amalekite king. It may be a general title for an Amalekite king, much like the Egyptian "pharaoh." Balaam prophesied that Israel’s king would be greater than Agag ([Numbers 24:7](https://ref.ly/Num24:7)).
2. The name of another Amalekite king. God told Samuel to send King Saul to destroy all the Amalekites, down to the last sheep. Saul defeated them but saved Agag, as well as the Amalekites' best sheep and oxen. Samuel then killed Agag and told Saul that his disobedience meant he could no longer be Israel's king ([1 Samuel 15](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam15:35)).
