## Moladah (id: 7187)

MOLADAH
=======

One of the cities belonging to Judah’s tribe ([Jos 15:26](https://ref.ly/Josh15:26)), later assigned to Simeon ([Jos 19:2](https://ref.ly/Josh19:2); [1 Chr 4:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:28)). The people of Judah resettled that area after the exile ([Neh 11:26](https://ref.ly/Neh11:26)).

Some consider Moladah identical to Malatha, which became an Idumean fortress occupied by the Edomites (Josephus’s *Antiquities* 18\.6\.2\). Others place it by Jattir, at modern Khureibet el\-Waten, as do Jerome and Eusebius. The evidence is, however, too obscure to make certain identification.
