## Naioth (id: 7296)

NAIOTH
======

Naioth was a place where David found safety when King Saul was trying to kill him ([1 Samuel 19:18–20:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:18-1Sam20:1)).The prophet Samuel gave David a place to stay there. Samuel also led a group of prophets in Naioth. These prophets lived and worked together in the town of Ramah, where Samuel was from ([1 Samuel 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:19), [23](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:23)).

The name “Naioth” is hard to explain. It only appears in this story, and the Hebrew word is not clear. Some people think it comes from a Hebrew word that means “dwelling place” (a place where people live). In [2 Samuel 15:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:25), a similar word is used for the place where God lives. This has led some to think that Naioth might have been a kind of sanctuary (a special place for worship or prayer) in Ramah (see also [1 Samuel 10:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:5)). 

Others think Naioth was a place where prophets lived and learned together, like a school or a small community. Samuel was the leader of this group.
