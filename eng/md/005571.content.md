## Thorn (id: 8822)

THORN
=====

A thorn is a sharp point that grows from the stem or branch of a plant. Thorns can hurt people or animals that touch them. Some plants grow thorns to protect themselves.

The Bible often mentions thorns. They can be part of the land’s natural plants, or they can be a symbol of pain, trouble, or punishment. For example, after Adam and Eve sinned, God said the ground would grow thorns and thistles ([Genesis 3:18](https://ref.ly/Gen3:18)).

People also used thorns to make a crown and put it on Jesus’s head to mock him before his death ([Matthew 27:29](https://ref.ly/Matt27:29)).
