## Strangling (id: 8635)

STRANGLING
==========

Strangling is the act of choking or suffocating a person or animal by squeezing the throat, cutting off air and blood flow. In the Bible, the term refers to animals that were killed without their blood being drained, such as by suffocation. It was one of four practices that the early gentile Christians were asked to avoid out of respect for their Jewish Christian brothers and sisters.

Jewish law did not allow eating meat from animals whose blood was not fully drained when they were killed. The Jerusalem Council asked the early church to follow this practice to keep peace between Jewish and gentile Christians ([Acts 15:20, 29](https://ref.ly/Acts15:20,Acts15:29); [21:25](https://ref.ly/Acts21:25)).

Strangling was also one of four ways that Jewish law courts carried out the death penalty. Even though the Bible does not mention it as a punishment method, strangling was later used by rabbinic Judaism as a way to execute people.
