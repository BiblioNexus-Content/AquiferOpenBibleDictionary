## Sackcloth (id: 8089)

SACKCLOTH
=========

Sackcloth was a rough material, often made from goat hair, used primarily as a symbol of mourning. Some prophets and captives also wore it.

Sackcloth was usually dark and coarse ([Isaiah 50:3](https://ref.ly/Isa50:3); [Revelation 6:12](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12)). There are two main views about its shape. 

1. Sackcloth was a rectangular garment, sewn on the sides and one end, with openings for the head and arms. This shape is similar to the grain sacks used by Joseph's brothers ([Genesis 42:25–27, 35](https://ref.ly/Gen42:25-Gen42:27,Gen42:35)) and the sacks used by the Gibeonites ([Joshua 9:4](https://ref.ly/Josh9:4); compare [Leviticus 11:32](https://ref.ly/Lev11:32)).
2. Sackcloth was more like a small loincloth. Hebrew practices support this. They include girding the loins with sackcloth ([2 Samuel 3:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:31); [Isaiah 15:3](https://ref.ly/Isa15:3); [22:12](https://ref.ly/Isa22:12); [Jeremiah 4:8](https://ref.ly/Jer4:8)) and the placing of sackcloth on the loins ([Genesis 37:34](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34); [1 Kings 20:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:31); [Jeremiah 48:37](https://ref.ly/Jer48:37)), though more than one type of garment could have been made from sackcloth.

Sackcloth was mainly associated with mourning ([Genesis 37:34](https://ref.ly/Gen37:34); [1 Kings 21:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:27); [Lamentations 2:10](https://ref.ly/Lam2:10)). It was worn during national ([2 Kings 6:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:30); [Nehemiah 9:1](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1); [Isaiah 37:1](https://ref.ly/Isa37:1); [Jonah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:8)) as well as personal crises constituted times for the wearing of sackcloth. It was worn by:

* Kings ([1 Kings 21:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:27); [2 Kings 6:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:30))
* Priests ([Joel 1:13](https://ref.ly/Joel1:13))
* Elders ([Lamentations 2:10](https://ref.ly/Lam2:10))
* Prophets ([Isaiah 20:2](https://ref.ly/Isa20:2); [Zechariah 13:4](https://ref.ly/Zech13:4))
* Cattle ([Jonah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:8))

It was worn by those who were repenting ([Nehemiah 9:1](https://ref.ly/Neh9:1); [Jeremiah 6:26](https://ref.ly/Jer6:26); compare [Matthew 11:21](https://ref.ly/Matt11:21)). This practice was not limited to Israel ([Isaiah 15:3](https://ref.ly/Isa15:3); [Jeremiah 49:3](https://ref.ly/Jer49:3); [Ezekiel 27:31](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:31); [Jonah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:5)). 

It has been suggested that the rough texture of sackcloth was uncomfortable and used to punish the wearer. However, there is no evidence to support this idea.
