============

Ethiopian eunuch in King Zedekiah’s court. He secured the king’s permission to rescue the prophet Jeremiah out of a cistern where he had been thrown to die ([Jer 38:6–13](https://ref.ly/Jer38:6-Jer38:13)). For this righteous act, Ebed\-melech was promised God’s safety at the fall of Jerusalem ([39:16](https://ref.ly/Jer39:16)).
