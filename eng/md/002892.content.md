## Jaaziel (id: 6144)

JAAZIEL
=======

Jaaziel was one of eight men chosen to play harps or lyres when King David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem([1 Chronicles 15:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:18-1Chr15:20)). He is probably also the person called Jeiel in [1 Chronicles 16:5a](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5). That name may be a copyist’s mistake. In [1 Chronicles 16:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:20), he is called Aziel.
