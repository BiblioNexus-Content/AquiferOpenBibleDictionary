## Girgashites (id: 5476)

GIRGASHITES
===========

A Canaanite tribe ([Genesis 10:16](https://ref.ly/Gen10:16); [1 Chronicles 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:14)) whose land was promised to Abraham ([Genesis 15:21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:21); [Deuteronomy 7:1](https://ref.ly/Deut7:1); [Joshua 3:10](https://ref.ly/Josh3:10)). The land was ultimately acquired ([Joshua 24:11](https://ref.ly/Josh24:11); [Nehemiah 9:8](https://ref.ly/Neh9:8)). The tribe’s location is unknown. They may have lived in Karkisha, a city mentioned in Hittite texts, or in Kirkishati, an area east of the Tigris. The name *Gresh* appeared in 13th century BC Ugaritic texts and might indicate a tribe. In [Matthew 8:28](https://ref.ly/Matt8:28); [Mark 5:1](https://ref.ly/Mark5:1); and [Luke 8:26](https://ref.ly/Luke8:26), a name variously translated as “Gergesenes” (King James Version), “Gerasenes,” and “Gadarenes” may preserve the tradition that the Girgashites once lived in Palestine.
