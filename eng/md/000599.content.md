## Atroth-Beth-Joab (id: 3868)

ATROTH\-BETH\-JOAB
==================

A town in Judah near Bethlehem ([1 Chronicles 2:54](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:54)). 

The Hebrew word *‘ataroth* means “crowns.” So, some scholars think that the phrase may refer to Salma’s descendants as chiefs of Joab’s clan.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:54
