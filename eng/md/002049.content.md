## Frankincense (id: 5304)

FRANKINCENSE
============

Frankincense is a sweet\-smelling gum resin (a thick, sticky liquid) that comes from trees. People can grind it into a powder and burn it to release a pleasant aroma. 

Frankincense is mentioned 21 times in the Bible. It is often mentioned together with myrrh ([Song of Solomon 3:6](https://ref.ly/Song3:6); [4:6](https://ref.ly/Song4:6); [Matthew 2:11](https://ref.ly/Matt2:11)). The Hebrew people probably used it almost exclusively in sacrificial services of the tabernacle and temple until the time of King Solomon. Throughout history, frankincense has been the most important incense resin in the world. 

Frankincense comes from balsam trees of the genus Boswellia. The main species that produce frankincense are *Boswellia carterii*, *Boswellia papyrifera*, and *Boswellia thurifera*. These trees are related to turpentine trees and have star\-shaped flowers that are white or green with pink tips. To collect the resin, people make a deep cut in the tree trunk, which releases an amber\-colored gum.

These trees grew naturally only in Saba (Sheba) in Arabia and Somaliland ([Isaiah 60:6](https://ref.ly/Isa60:6); [Jeremiah 6:20](https://ref.ly/Jer6:20)). Because frankincense had to be brought from far away, it was expensive. It was transported to Palestine by caravans (groups of travelers with camels and other animals). The tree called the "frankincense tree" in Palestine ([Sirach 50:8](https://ref.ly/Sir50:8)) was probably a different tree called *Commiphora opobalsamum*. The resin from this tree was used to make perfume.

People used frankincense by itself or mixed it with other substances to make incense. It was one of the ingredients in the holy incense used for worship in the tabernacle ([Exodus 30:34](https://ref.ly/Exod30:34)). People placed frankincense on the bread of the Presence ([Leviticus 24:7](https://ref.ly/Lev24:7)). They also mixed it with oil on the grain offerings ([Leviticus 2:1](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:2,Lev2:14-Lev2:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:2)[2, 14](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:2,Lev2:14-Lev2:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:2)[16](https://ref.ly/Lev2:1-Lev2:2,Lev2:14-Lev2:16); [6:15](https://ref.ly/Lev6:15)). However, it was not included in sin offerings ([Leviticus 5:11](https://ref.ly/Lev5:11)). The temple in Jerusalem kept a supply of frankincense ([Nehemiah 13:5, 9](https://ref.ly/Neh13:5,Neh13:9)). Later, people also used frankincense in cosmetics and perfumes ([Song of Solomon 3:6](https://ref.ly/Song3:6)).

Because frankincense was valuable and used in worship, giving it as a gift to the infant Jesus was considered very appropriate ([Matthew 2:11](https://ref.ly/Matt2:11)).
