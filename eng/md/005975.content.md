## Ziha (id: 9220)

ZIHA
====

1\. Ancestor of a family of temple servants who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile ([Ezr 2:43](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:43); [Neh 7:46](https://ref.ly/Neh7:46)).

2\. Overseer of the temple servants living at Ophel during the postexilic era ([Neh 11:21](https://ref.ly/Neh11:21)). If Ziha is simply a family name, then this person is likely the same as \#1 above.
