## Geshem (id: 5434)

GESHEM
======

An Arab opponent of Nehemiah who mocked those working to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 2:19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:19); [6:1–6](https://ref.ly/Neh6:1-Neh6:6)). It is probable he lived in the north Arabian Desert. A Dedanite Arabian inscription has identified him as “Gashmu,” son of Shahr. Like Sanballat and Tobiah, the rebuilding of Jerusalem threatened his economic interests.
