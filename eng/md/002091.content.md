## Gaius (id: 5347)

GAIUS
=====

1. A man from Macedonia who traveled with the apostle Paul during the apostle's third missionary journey. Rioters seized Gaius and Aristarchus at Ephesus. Demetrius the silversmith started the riot ([Acts 19:29](https://ref.ly/Acts19:29)).
2. A man from Derbe in Lycaonia (a region in what is now Turkey). He traveled with the apostle Paul from Ephesus to Macedonia ([Acts 20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). Some have identified him with \#1 above.
3. An important Christian in Corinth. He hosted Paul and the whole church there ([Romans 16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23)). Paul wrote the letter of Romans at Corinth. So, the Gaius mentioned in [1 Corinthians 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:14) is probably the same person. If so, Paul baptized him.
4. A man to whom the apostle John addressed his third letter ([3 John 1:1](https://ref.ly/3John1:1)).
