CHIDON
======

The threshing floor where God struck down Huzzah as he attempted to steady the ark of the covenant ([1 Chronicles 13:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:9)). The parallel passage in [2 Samuel 6:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6) refers to this place as “the threshing floor of Nacon.” Following the death of Uzzah, King David renamed the place, "Perez\-uzzah." This means either “the breach of Uzzah” or “the outbreak against Uzzah” ([2 Samuel 6:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:8); [1 Chronicles 13:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:11)).
