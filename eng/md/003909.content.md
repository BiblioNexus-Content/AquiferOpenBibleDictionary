## Misrephoth-Maim (id: 7168)

MISREPHOTH\-MAIM
================

One of the northernmost places to which the Israelites pursued the fleeing Canaanite armies defeated at the waters of Merom ([Jos 11:8](https://ref.ly/Josh11:8)). Misrephoth\-maim, meaning “burning of water,” defined part of the boundary of land remaining yet to be possessed by Israel during the days of Joshua ([13:6](https://ref.ly/Josh13:6)). In all probability, Misrephoth\-maim is identical with the cluster of springs at Khirbet el\-Musheirifeh near the Mediterranean Sea, 20 miles (32\.2 kilometers) south of Sidon and 6 miles (9\.7 kilometers) north of Tyre, at the base of Ras en\-Nakurah.
