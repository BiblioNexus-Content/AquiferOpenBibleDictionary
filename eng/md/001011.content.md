## Boat (id: 4282)

BOAT
====

A boat is a small vehicle used to travel on water.

In the Bible, people used boats for fishing, travel, or as small rescue boats on larger ships. Boats were moved with oars (long sticks used to row) or sails (cloth that catches the wind).

Many of Jesus’s followers were fishermen, so boats are mentioned often in the Gospels.
