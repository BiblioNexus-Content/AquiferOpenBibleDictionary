## Heshbon (id: 5827)

HESHBON
=======

An important city across the Jordan River (Trans\-jordan). It was about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Jerusalem. At first, it belonged to the Moabites. Later, the Amorite king Sihon conquered Heshbon. Then it became the capital of his kingdom ([Numbers 21:25–30](https://ref.ly/Num21:25-Num21:30)). Israel captured the city when they advanced into Canaan. The tribe of Reuben took control of this portion of the Amorite territory ([Numbers 32:37](https://ref.ly/Num32:37); [Joshua 13:17](https://ref.ly/Josh13:17)). Yet, it was on the boundary between Reuben and Gad ([Joshua 13:26](https://ref.ly/Josh13:26)). This resulted in the tribe of Gad occupying it. After this, the Moabites fought with Israel over who would control this land.

During the time when judges led Israel, different groups controlled the land at different times. ([Judges 3:12](https://ref.ly/Judg3:12); [1 Samuel 12:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:9-1Sam12:11)). Israel controlled Heshbon until around 853 BC. Then Mesha, king of Moab occupied it. The Scriptures mention Heshbon in prophecies before the Israelite exile to Babylon (compare [Isaiah 15:4](https://ref.ly/Isa15:4); [16:8–9](https://ref.ly/Isa16:8-Isa16:9); [Jeremiah 48:2, 33–34](https://ref.ly/Jer48:2,Jer48:33-Jer48:34)). [Jeremiah 49:3](https://ref.ly/Jer49:3)seems to indicate the Ammonites later took control of Heshbon.

It was an important Nabatean city in the Greek period. The Jews conquered it during the campaigns of Alexander Janneus. He was a Hasmonean king and high priest who ruled Judea from 103 to 76 BC. In the Roman period, Heshbon became part of the province of Syria.
