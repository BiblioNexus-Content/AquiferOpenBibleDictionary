## Arkite (id: 3743)

ARKITE
======

Name of a clan descended from Ham’s son Canaan ([Genesis 10:17](https://ref.ly/Gen10:17); [1 Chronicles 1:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:15)). The Arkites were probably residents of Arqa, a Phoenician town north of Tripolis in Syria. 

According to an early inscription, Arqa was captured by the Assyrian Tiglath\-pileser III in 738 BC. Another branch of the tribe may have settled near Ataroth, a town on the border between Ephraim and Benjamin ([Joshua 16:2](https://ref.ly/Josh16:2)).
