## Feast of Ingathering (id: 6021)

FEAST OF INGATHERING
====================

The Feast of Ingathering was one of the three major festivals celebrated by the people of Israel. It was also called the Feast of Booths or the Feast of Tabernacles. This festival celebrated the end of the farming year when all crops had been harvested ([Leviticus 23:39–43](https://ref.ly/Lev23:39-Lev23:43)). 

During this celebration, the Israelites lived in temporary shelters made of tree branches for seven days. This reminded them of the time when their ancestors lived in similar shelters in the wilderness.
