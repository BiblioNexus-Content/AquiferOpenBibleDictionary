## Ahitub (id: 3460)

AHITUB
======

1. A member of the priestly line of Aaron’s youngest son, Ithamar. Ahitub was a descendant of Eli through Eli’s son Phinehas and father of Ahijah and Ahimelech, who were priests during Saul’s reign ([1 Samuel 14:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:3); [22:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:12,1Sam22:20)–[12, 20](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:12,1Sam22:20)).
2. A member of the priestly line of Aaron’s third son, Eleazar. Ahitub was Meraioth’s grandson, Amariah’s son, and father of Zadok ([1 Chronicles 6:4–7](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:4-1Chr6:7)). Zadok was a chief priest during David’s reign ([2 Samuel 8:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:17)).
3. Possibly the same as \#2 above (scribes sometimes copy names twice), but probably another member of the priestly line of Eleazar, seven generations after \#2 ([1 Chronicles 6:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:11-1Chr6:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:11-1Chr6:12)). Ahitub’s father was also named Amariah, and his son or grandson was Zadok ([1 Chronicles 9:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:11); [Nehemiah 11:11](https://ref.ly/Neh11:11)). His grandfather was Azariah. Ahitub is listed as an ancestor of Ezra ([Ezra 7:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:2); [1 Esdras 8:2](https://ref.ly/1Esd8:2); [2 Esdras 1:1](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:1)).
