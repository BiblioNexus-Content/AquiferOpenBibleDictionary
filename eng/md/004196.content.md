## Obedience (id: 7453)

OBEDIENCE
=========

The act or instance of submitting to the restraint or command of an authority. It is compliance with the demands or requests of someone over us. The general words for obedience in both Hebrew and Greek refer to hearing or listening to a superior authority. Another important Greek word includes the idea of submission to authority in the sense of arranging or ordering oneself under someone in a place of command. A third Greek word suggests obedience that is a result more of persuasion than of submission.

Obedience to God and human authorities is an obligation stressed in both the Old Testament and New Testament. Abraham was additionally blessed on one occasion because he obeyed God in offering Isaac on the altar ([Genesis 22:18](https://ref.ly/Gen22:18); compare [26:5](https://ref.ly/Gen26:5)). God would continue to bless Israel because of the covenant made at Mount Sinai, but this was dependent upon their obeying his voice and keeping his covenant ([Exodus 19:5](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5)). As they were about to enter Canaan, Moses placed before the Israelites a blessing and a curse—a blessing if they listened to and obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and a curse if they did not ([Deuteronomy 11:22–28](https://ref.ly/Deut11:22-Deut11:28)).

Deuteronomy warns that the penalty for stubborn and rebellious children is, first of all, punishment, and then death by stoning if they persistently refuse to listen ([Deuteronomy 21:18–21](https://ref.ly/Deut21:18-Deut21:21)).

One sign that a person is a child of God is continued obedience to the commandments of God ([1 John 2:3–5](https://ref.ly/1John2:3-1John2:5)). Jesus said that those who love him would keep his commandments ([John 14:15](https://ref.ly/John14:15)). And Peter, speaking of Christians, calls them “obedient children” ([1 Peter 1:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:14); see also [Hebrews 5:9](https://ref.ly/Heb5:9); [11:8](https://ref.ly/Heb11:8)).

Christians are to obey a variety of people: 

* Believers are to obey the Lord ([John 14:21–24](https://ref.ly/John14:21-John14:24); [15:10](https://ref.ly/John15:10)).
* Wives are to obey their husbands ([Ephesians 5:22–24](https://ref.ly/Eph5:22-Eph5:24); [Colossians 3:18](https://ref.ly/Col3:18); [Titus 2:5](https://ref.ly/Titus2:5); [1 Peter 3:1, 5](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:1,1Pet3:5)).
* Children are to obey their parents ([Ephesians 6:1](https://ref.ly/Eph6:1); [Colossians 3:20](https://ref.ly/Col3:20)).
* Citizens are to obey their government officials ([Romans 13:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7); [Titus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Titus3:1); [1 Peter 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:13-1Pet2:14))
* Servants are to obey their masters ([Ephesians 6:5](https://ref.ly/Eph6:5); [Colossians 3:22](https://ref.ly/Col3:22); [Titus 2:9](https://ref.ly/Titus2:9); [1 Peter 2:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:18)).

However, despite the strong emphasis on obedience in the Bible, such obedience is never made the grounds for justification before God. Paul declares that salvation is a gift of God that will produce good works ([Ephesians 2:8–10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:10)). So, too, James speaks of works of obedience as coming from faith ([James 2:14–26](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26)).

Jesus himself, on the night of his betrayal, emphasized by repetition that love for him is measured by obedience to his commandments ([John 14:15, 21, 23–24](https://ref.ly/John14:15,John14:21,John14:23-John14:24); [15:10](https://ref.ly/John15:10)). He emphasized this by declaring that his own love for God the Father was evidenced by his obeying the Father’s commands ([14:31](https://ref.ly/John14:31)). The Bible mentions many people whose obedience to God comes from their faith and love for him ([Hebrews 11](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:40)). For example, Abel believed God and offered a more excellent sacrifice (verse [4](https://ref.ly/Heb11:4)). Noah put his faith in God’s word and prepared a very large boat (or ark; see verse [7](https://ref.ly/Heb11:7)). By faith Abraham left his home in Ur at God’s direction, not knowing his destination (verse [8](https://ref.ly/Heb11:8)). Moses put his faith in God and refused the privileges of being called Pharaoh’s son, choosing rather to identify with Israel, God’s people (verses [24–25](https://ref.ly/Heb11:24-Heb11:25)). The greatest example of obedience based on trust in God is Jesus Christ himself. He emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant. He humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross ([Philippians 2:7–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:7-Phil2:8)).
