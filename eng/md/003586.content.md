## Madmen (id: 6845)

MADMEN
======

Town in Moab, according to Jeremiah’s oracle ([Jer 48:2](https://ref.ly/Jer48:2)). It may be a form created by dittography from an original Dimon, as in the oracle against Moab by Isaiah ([Is 15:9](https://ref.ly/Isa15:9)). If so, Khirbet Dimneh, seven and a half miles (12\.1 kilometers) northwest of Kerak at the head of Wadi Beni Hammad, would be a possible site. In any case, there is a word play in the Jeremiah passage between the place\-name and the Hebrew word “be silent.”

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 15:9; JER 48:2
