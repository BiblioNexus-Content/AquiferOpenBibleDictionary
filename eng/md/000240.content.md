## Alexander (Balas) Epiphanes (id: 3499)

ALEXANDER (BALAS) EPIPHANES
===========================

A man who falsely claimed to be the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Syrian king. He arrived at the city of Ptolemais in 152 BC. From 150 BC, he began saying he was the rightful king. 

Alexander asked Jonathan Maccabeus for help. In return, he made Jonathan the high priest. Alexander then fought and beat the Syrian King Demetrius I.

To strengthen his position, Alexander married the daughter of Ptolemy VI, king of Egypt. However, in 147 BC, Demetrius II challenged Alexander, and Alexander was defeated in 145 BC ([1 Maccabees 10–11](https://ref.ly/1Macc10:1-1Macc11:74)).
