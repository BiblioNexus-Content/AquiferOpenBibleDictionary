## Jesse (Person) (id: 6349)

JESSE (Person)
==============

Son of Obed and grandson of Ruth and Boaz ([Ru 4:17, 22](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:17,Ruth4:22)). Jesse was a shepherd from Bethlehem. He had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest. He had at least two daughters, Zeruiah and Abigail, who became mothers of famous warriors.

When Samuel went to Jesse’s home to search for and anoint a king, Jesse did not at first feel it worthwhile to call David for examination ([1 Sm 16:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:11)). Later he sent David to play the lyre for Saul (vv [19–21](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:19-1Sam16:21)). After David became a fugitive from Saul, Jesse and others of the family came to David in the cave of Adullam. David then brought his father and mother to Mizpah in Moab ([22:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:3)). Nothing further is heard of Jesse.

After Saul broke with David, he commonly spoke of David derisively as a “son of Jesse” to underscore his humble origins ([1 Sm 20:31](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:31); [22:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:7)). This same emphasis on Jesse’s modest station in life is found in such messianic references as [Isaiah 11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1) and [10](https://ref.ly/Isa10:1-Isa10:34), which speak of the “shoot from the stump of Jesse” and “the root of Jesse” (rsv).
