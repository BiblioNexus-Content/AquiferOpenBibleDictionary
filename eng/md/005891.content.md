## Zanoah (Place) (id: 9136)

ZANOAH (Place)
==============

1\. One of the cities “in the lowland” that was part of Judah’s inheritance ([Jos 15:34](https://ref.ly/Josh15:34)). The inhabitants of Zanoah worked with Hanun to rebuild the Valley Gate as well as about 1,500 feet (457\.2 meters) of the city wall during the restoration of Jerusalem ([Neh 3:13](https://ref.ly/Neh3:13); [11:30](https://ref.ly/Neh11:30)). The city is probably identifiable with Zanu’a, which is located approximately 10 miles (16\.1 kilometers) west of Jerusalem.

2\. One of the cities in the Judean highlands south of Hebron that was part of Judah’s inheritance ([Jos 15:56](https://ref.ly/Josh15:56)). It was probably inhabited by the descendants of Zanoah, Jekuthiel’s son.
