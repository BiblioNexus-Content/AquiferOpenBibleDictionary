## Kenaz (id: 6548)

KENAZ
=====

The singular form of the name of the Kenizzite tribe. God promised their land to the descendants of Abraham ([Genesis 15:19](https://ref.ly/Gen15:19)). The Old Testament mentions three different men with this name. This might be because the Kenizzites had moved into both Edom (a land to the south) and southern Judah (part of what would become Israel). This happened before the Israelites conquered the land.

1. A grandson of Esau and a clan leader of Edom ([Genesis 36:11, 15, 42](https://ref.ly/Gen36:11,Gen36:15,Gen36:42); [1 Chronicles 1:36, 53](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:36,1Chr1:53)).
2. The father of Othniel and Seraiah ([Joshua 15:17](https://ref.ly/Josh15:17); [Judges 1:13](https://ref.ly/Judg1:13); [3:9–11](https://ref.ly/Judg3:9-Judg3:11); [1 Chronicles 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:13)).
3. A descendant of Caleb ([1 Chronicles 4:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:15)). *See* Kenizzites.
