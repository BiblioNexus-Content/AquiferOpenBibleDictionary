## Blood, Field of (id: 4273)

BLOOD, Field of
===============

The name given to the field that was purchased with the “blood money” Judas accepted to betray Jesus ([Matthew 27:8](https://ref.ly/Matt27:8); [Acts 1:19](https://ref.ly/Acts1:19)). The chief priests purchased the field as a burial ground for strangers (formerly, it was named the potter’s field). Judas hanged himself, and his intestines spilled out there. This account uses the Aramaic expression *Akeldama* (in the King James Version it is “Aceldama”), translated “field of blood.” The Akeldama is on the southern slope of the valley of Hinnom near the Kidron Valley.
