## Massah and Meribah (id: 6971)

MASSAH AND MERIBAH
==================

Massah and Meribah were two places where the Israelites complained about not having water during their journey through the desert. In Hebrew, *massah* means “to put to the test” and *meribah* means “to find fault, quarrel” ([Exodus 17:7](https://ref.ly/Exod17:7)). At Rephidim, the Israelites had no water to drink. God told Moses to strike a rock, and water came out of it. Moses gave this place two names (Massah and Meribah) because the people tested God by doubting he would provide for them

The Bible mentions Massah four times when talking about how the Israelites rebelled against God ([Deuteronomy 6:16](https://ref.ly/Deut6:16); [9:22](https://ref.ly/Deut9:22); [33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8); [Psalm 95:8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8)). 

In contrast, [Numbers 20:13, 24](https://ref.ly/Num20:13,Num20:24); [27:14](https://ref.ly/Num27:14); and [Deuteronomy 32:51](https://ref.ly/Deut32:51) place Meribah near Kadesh in the Zin wilderness. There, Moses struck the rock twice to produce water. [Psalm 81:7](https://ref.ly/Ps81:7) and [Deuteronomy 33:8](https://ref.ly/Deut33:8) suggest that God was testing the Israelites during these events.
