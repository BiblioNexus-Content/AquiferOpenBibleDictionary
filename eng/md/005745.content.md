## Valley Gate (id: 8995)

VALLEY GATE
===========

The gate Nehemiah used to exit and reenter when he inspected the walls of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Neh2:13-Neh2:14)). It was on the west side of the city facing the Tyropeon Valley. King Uzziah is said to have built and strengthened a tower at this gate ([2 Chronicles 26:9](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:9)).
