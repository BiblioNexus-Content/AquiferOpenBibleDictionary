## Yoke (id: 9106)

YOKE
====

The wooden bar that linked two (or more) draft animals so they could work together ([Numbers 19:2](https://ref.ly/Num19:2); [1 Kings 19:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:19); [Job 1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3)). Besides its literal use, the Bible often uses the term metaphorically. It refers to work or bondage ([Leviticus 26:13](https://ref.ly/Lev26:13)). Israel's own kings, not just foreign oppressors, applied the yoke of bondage ([1 Kings 12:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14)[14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4-1Kgs12:14); [2 Chronicles 10:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)[14](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:4-2Chr10:14)). In prophetic writings, the yoke of bondage was linked to divine judgment ([Lamentations 1:14](https://ref.ly/Lam1:14)). So, deliverance was seen as God breaking the yoke that had enslaved Israel ([Isaiah 9:4](https://ref.ly/Isa9:4); [10:27](https://ref.ly/Isa10:27); [14:25](https://ref.ly/Isa14:25); [58:6](https://ref.ly/Isa58:6); [Jeremiah 2:20](https://ref.ly/Jer2:20); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Jer5:5)). Jeremiah's dispute with Hananiah's prophecy was about the yoke of bondage. Hananiah claimed that Judah would soon be freed from Babylonian captivity ([Jeremiah 27:8](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Jer27:8-Jer27:11); [28:1](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17)). 

In the New Testament, Jesus makes "yoke" a positive term. He asks people to take up his yoke, which is not burdensome. He will give them rest for their souls ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)[30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29-Matt11:30)).
