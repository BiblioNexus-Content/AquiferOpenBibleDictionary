## Jethro (id: 6360)

JETHRO
======

The father\-in\-law of Moses. Jethro's daughter, Zipporah, became Moses's wife while Moses was hiding as a fugutive in the wilderness ([Exodus 2:21](https://ref.ly/Exod2:21)). When Moses left for Egypt, he took Zipporah and his sons with him, but later sent them back ([4:20](https://ref.ly/Exod4:20)). Jethro brought them to Moses after the Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai ([Exodus 18:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1-Exod18:7)). Through this family connection with Moses, Jethro became involved with the Israelite people.

What Was Jethro's Relationship with Israel?
-------------------------------------------

Scholars have understood Jethro's relationship with Israel in different ways. Jethro was a priest of Midian ([Exodus 2:16](https://ref.ly/Exod2:16); [3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1)). We do not know for certain what religion the Midianites followed. The Kenites were a tribe within the Midianite nation ([Judges 1:16](https://ref.ly/Judg1:16)). Some scholars have suggested that the Kenites had a tribal god named Yahweh whom Jethro served as priest. Scholars who have suggested that Moses introduced Jethro's tribal god, Yahweh, to Israel have not been able to prove this idea. The evidence in the Bible does not support this view.

It is clear that Jethro was a man who feared and served God. The Bible could be understood to teach that Jethro knew about Israel's God because he was a descendant of Abraham ([Genesis 25:2](https://ref.ly/Gen25:2)). After hearing how God rescued Israel from Egypt, Jethro acknowledged Yahweh as God, the greatest of all gods. He also brought a burnt offering and sacrifices, worshiping Yahweh and identifying with Israel ([Exodus 18:11](https://ref.ly/Exod18:11)). Some scholars have interpreted this action as Jethro accepting a covenant with Israel. But this interpretation is based on a misunderstanding of what Jethro actually did and the meaning of sacrifice and a shared meal.

After receiving Jethro's good advice about how to handle disputes among the people, Moses appointed capable men as leaders and judges over the people ([Exodus 18:13–27](https://ref.ly/Exod18:13-Exod18:27)). Jethro then returned to his own land and seems to have had no further contact with Israel. But his son and other descendants later became part of Israel ([Numbers 10:29–33](https://ref.ly/Num10:29-Num10:33); [Judges 1:16](https://ref.ly/Judg1:16); [4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)).

Jethro's Other Names
--------------------

Jethro is known by other names in the Bible and later writings. The Talmud (a collection of Jewish teachings and explanations of the Torah, including laws, traditions, and discussions by rabbis) records that his name was originally Jether. But after his conversion, his name was Jethro (there is no clear evidence to support this). He is also called Reuel. He is the father of seven daughters who met Moses at a well ([Exodus 2:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:16-Exod2:18); [Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29)). He is also referred to by the name Hobab ([Judges 4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)). And Hobab is said to be the son of Reuel ([Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29)). 

The Bible does not explain why different names are used. Some possible explanations include:

1. Each Midianite tribe he served as priest knew him by a different name.
2. Reuel was a tribal name, not a personal name.
3. Hobab, the son’s name, was sometimes used to refer to the father.
4. A gloss appears in the text at [Exodus 2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18) and [Judges 4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)

Despite the confusion about names, we can clearly establish that Jethro had a son named Hobab.
