## Me-Jarkon (id: 7024)

ME\-JARKON
==========

Topographical designation in the description of Dan’s inheritance ([Jos 19:46](https://ref.ly/Josh19:46)). It is probably not a settlement; Jarkon seems to be the name of the river (el\-’Awjah) flowing across the coastal plain from the springs at Aphek to the coast four miles (6\.4 kilometers) north of Joppa. It was a formidable obstacle to north–south travel, but the numerous ancient sites along its banks testify to its importance as an entryway from the sea to the interior of the country.
