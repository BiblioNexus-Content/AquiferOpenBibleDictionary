## Bronze Sea (id: 4343)

BRONZE SEA
==========

Large tank of water in Solomon’s temple yard for the priests’ washing ([1 Kgs 7:23–44](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:23-1Kgs7:44); [2 Kgs 16:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:17); [25:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:13); [1 Chr 18:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:8); [2 Chr 4:2–6, 15](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:2-2Chr4:6,2Chr4:15); [Jer 52:17](https://ref.ly/Jer52:17)). Cast from bronze and about three inches (7\.6 centimeters) thick (a handbreadth), it was mounted on 12 bronze oxen (three facing in each compass direction) in the courtyard at the southeast corner of the sanctuary. It was five cubits (about 7\.5 feet, or over 2 meters) high and ten cubits (15 feet, or 4\.6 meters) in diameter, with a capacity of either 2,000 baths ([1 Kgs 7:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:26)) or 3,000 ([2 Chr 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:5)). The discrepancy possibly comes from a scribal error. The bath (originally a vessel large enough to hold a person) was a liquid measure of about 6 gallons (23 liters), so the tank held perhaps 18,000 gallons (68,136 liters) of water.
