## Beth-pelet (id: 4195)

BETH\-PELET
===========

A city given to the tribe of Judah when Joshua divided up the promised land among the tribes of Israel ([Joshua 15:27](https://ref.ly/Josh15:27)). The people of Judah returned to the city after they returned from exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 11:26](https://ref.ly/Neh11:26)). Beth\-pelet was possibly the hometown of David’s warrior Helez the Paltite ([2 Samuel 23:26](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:26); [1 Chronicles 11:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27), also called “Pelonite”).
