## Koheleth (id: 6638)

KOHELETH
========

Another spelling for Qoheleth. This is an alternative way to write the Hebrew title of the book of Ecclesiastes. The spelling difference comes from different ways of translating Hebrew letters into English. Both Koheleth and Qoheleth refer to the same person who wrote Ecclesiastes and called himself "the Teacher" or "the Preacher."
