## Antipatris (id: 3643)

ANTIPATRIS
==========

A city about 41\.8 kilometers (26 miles) south of Caesarea. It was rebuilt by Herod the Great in 9 BC in honor of his father, Antipater. Before Herod rebuilt it, the city was known as Aphek. When Paul was a Roman Prisoner, he traveled through Antipatris on his way from Jerusalem to Caesarea ([Acts 23:31](https://ref.ly/Acts23:31)). Antipatris was a Roman military relay station. It also marked the border between Judea and Samaria.
