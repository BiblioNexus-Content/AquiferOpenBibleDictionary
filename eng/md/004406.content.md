## Perfumer (id: 7665)

PERFUMER
========

A perfumer was a person who prepared oils, powders, and mixtures for three uses: 

1. Medicine
2. Perfumes
3. Incense used in religious ceremonies

Many plants, when crushed, provided oils or powders that smelled unique.

A perfumer is also known as an “apothecary” ([Exodus 30:25](https://ref.ly/Exod30:25), in the King James Version) or a “confectionary” ([1 Samuel 8:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:13), in the King James Version).
