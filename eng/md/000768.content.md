## Bavvai (id: 4038)

BAVVAI
======

An individual who managed the repair of a section of the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah’s supervision ([Nehemiah 3:18](https://ref.ly/Neh3:18)). Bavvai was Henadad’s son and the leader of half the district of Keilah, a town 17 miles, or 27\.4 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem. Binnui ([Nehemiah 3:24](https://ref.ly/Neh3:24)), who is also mentioned as Henadad’s son (compare [Ezra 3:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:9)), might be a mistaken spelling of Bavvai, or the two may have been brothers. 

*See* Binnui \#4.
