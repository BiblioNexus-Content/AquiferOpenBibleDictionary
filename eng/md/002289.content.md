## Guardian (id: 5545)

GUARDIAN
========

A servant who was responsible to accompany, protect, and sometimes discipline his master’s son until the boy reached maturity. Guardians supervised their charges’ moral conduct and general behavior. Their methods of persuasion varied from physical punishment to shaming. Paul regarded the law of Moses as a "schoolmaster" (King James Version), "custodian" (Revised Standard Version), or "tutor" (New American Standard Bible) to lead us to Christ ([Galatians 3:24–25](https://ref.ly/Gal3:24-Gal3:25)). To return to the law represented a return to childhood.
