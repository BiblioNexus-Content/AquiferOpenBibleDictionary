## Derbe (id: 4813)

DERBE
=====

A city of the Roman province of Asia. It was located in the district of Lycaonia in the province of Galatia ([Acts 14:6](https://ref.ly/Acts14:6)). Derbe was the last city visited by Paul during his first missionary journey (verse [20](https://ref.ly/Acts14:20)). It was also the first city Paul visited while on his second journey ([16:1](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1)). And it is likely one city he revisited on his third journey ([18:23](https://ref.ly/Acts18:23)). 

Gaius was from Derbe ([20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). He was one of the missionary companions of Paul on his third journey.
