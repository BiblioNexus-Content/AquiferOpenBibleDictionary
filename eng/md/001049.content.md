## Book of the Wars of the Lord (id: 9032)

BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD
============================

A document mentioned once in the Old Testament. [Numbers 21:14](https://ref.ly/Num21:14) mentions it in a description of the border of Moab at the Arnon River. Although we no longer have this book today, ancient writers used it as a source of information. The book probably contained records of how Israel conquered the land east of the Jordan River (called Transjordan). 

It may be the same as “the Book of Jashar” ([Joshua 10:13](https://ref.ly/Josh10:13); [2 Samuel 1:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam1:18)). The passage in [Numbers 21](https://ref.ly/Num21:1-Num21:35) is written like poetry and talks about Israel's battles and victories. Scholars disagree about which verses come from the Book of the Wars of the Lord. Some think it is only verse [14](https://ref.ly/Num21:14), while others include verse [15](https://ref.ly/Num21:15), and still others include verses [27–30](https://ref.ly/Num21:27-Num21:30).
