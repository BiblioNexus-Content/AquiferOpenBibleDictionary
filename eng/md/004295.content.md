## Palace (id: 7554)

PALACE
======

A palace is a house for a king or queen.

In the ancient world, cities with royal support often had a palace. These cities sometimes had a second wall around the palace and nearby buildings. This wall helped protect the area where the king or ruler lived. This part of the city was called the acropolis (the high part of the city).

Jerusalem had a similar area. It was called the City of David. Before that, it was known as the Citadel of Zion ([2 Samuel 5:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:7-2Sam5:9)).

Palaces in the Old Testament
----------------------------

The Old Testament does not give clear details about palaces in the land of Israel. For example, there was the palace of King David ([2 Samuel 11:2, 9](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2,2Sam11:9)), the palace of Tirzah ([1 Kings 16:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:18)) and the palace of Ahab in Jezreel ([21:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1)). 

Even the description of Solomon’s palace in Jerusalem is not very clear. In [1 Kings 7:1–12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:1-1Kgs7:12), the construction of public and private buildings close to the temple went on for 13 years. Solomon used the best materials. But the Bible does not give enough details to fully describe these buildings.

The buildings included the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Porch of Pillars, the Porch of the Throne, Solomon’s palace for his Egyptian wife, and the royal palace. We do not know exactly how these buildings were arranged. All of them were surrounded by a large courtyard made of cut stones and cedar wood.

### Forced Labor in Palace Building

Forced labor was common in the ancient Near East. The prophet Samuel warned that Israel’s king would use this system ([1 Samuel 8:12–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:12-1Sam8:17)). This happened during Solomon’s rule. Solomon used forced labor for his large building projects, including his palace.

Solomon took workers from all over Israel. This system made many people unhappy. It caused Jeroboam to lead a revolt ([1 Kings 12:4, 16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:4,1Kgs12:16)). 

Later kings also used forced labor. King Asa used it ([15:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:22)). It was still happening in the time of the prophet Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 22:13](https://ref.ly/Jer22:13)). n contrast, the builders who worked with Nehemiah were volunteers (see [Nehemiah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Neh3:5)).

### The Temple

One of Solomon’s most important buildings was the temple. It stood inside a courtyard called the inner court ([1 Kings 6:36](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:36)). A larger courtyard, called the great court, surrounded both the temple and the palace ([7:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:12). The palace itself had its own inner court (verse [8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:8)). The northern wall of the palace’s inner court was next to the inner court of the temple. This means the king’s palace was very close to the temple. The king could easily move from his court to the Lord’s court.

### **The King’s Throne and Royal Power**

The enthronement (when he became king) happened in the palace, in a place called the Porch of the Throne ([1 Kings 1:46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:46); [2 Kings 11:19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:19)). Sitting on the throne showed that the king now had royal power ([1 Kings 16:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:11); [2 Kings 13:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:13)). Solomon’s throne in the palace became a symbol of this power. But people still called it the throne of David ([1 Kings 2:24, 45](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:24,1Kgs2:45); [Isaiah 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7)). This was to show the connection to his father. 

Solomon’s throne was famous. It was known as one of the wonders of the world ([1 Kings 10:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:18-1Kgs10:20)). Important leaders came and showed him honor while standing around his throne ([1:47](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:47)).

### Life in the Royal Palace

The daughters of the king lived in the palace under the care of women until they were married ([2 Samuel 13:7](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:7)). They wore a distinctive dress (verses [18–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:18-2Sam13:19)). 

The king’s sons also lived in the palace. Nurses cared for them when they were young ([2 Kings 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2)). Important men of the city taught them ([10:1, 6–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1,2Kgs10:6-2Kgs10:7)). When the sons were older, they served in the royal court ([2 Samuel 8:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:18); [1 Chronicles 18:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:17)). Later, they lived on their own and the king gave them what they needed ([2 Chronicles 21:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:3)). 

Some sons, like Amnon and Absalom, lived outside the palace. Amnon had his own house ([2 Samuel 13:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:5)). Absalom had a house, land, and animals ([13:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:20), [23](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:23); [14:24](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:24), [30](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:30)). 

The royal family was surrounded by palace officials ([1 Kings 10:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:4-1Kgs10:5)). These officials were called the king’s servants. Some were allowed to “see the king’s face,” which meant they could enter his presence ([2 Samuel 14:24, 28, 32](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:24,2Sam14:28,2Sam14:32)). Others stood before the king ([1 Samuel 16:21–22](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:21-1Sam16:22); [Jeremiah 52:12](https://ref.ly/Jer52:12)). Being invited to eat at the king’s table was a great honor ([2 Samuel 9:7, 13](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:7,2Sam9:13)).
