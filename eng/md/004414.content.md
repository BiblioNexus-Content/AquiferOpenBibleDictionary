## Perseverance (id: 7673)

PERSEVERANCE
============

Perseverance means continuing to do something even when it is difficult. 

Perseverance in the Old Testament
---------------------------------

In the Old Testament, the people of Israel waited for many years to see God's promises come true. Many believers died before seeing these promises fulfilled ([Hebrews 11:1, 13, 21](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1,Heb11:13,Heb11:21-Heb11:22,Heb11:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1)[22, 39](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1,Heb11:13,Heb11:21-Heb11:22,Heb11:39)). The promise God made to Abraham gave people hope for hundreds of years before they finally lived in the land of Canaan. The Israelites learned an important lesson during their journey through the wilderness. They lost their early excitement, and this kept them from entering the promised land. The people of Israel never forgot this lesson ([Hebrews 3:16](https://ref.ly/Heb3:16-Heb3:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb3:16-Heb3:19)[19](https://ref.ly/Heb3:16-Heb3:19)). Prophets (people who spoke for God) always looked beyond failure and hard times. They saw hope for the future, and they helped people keep their faith strong ([Jeremiah 32:1](https://ref.ly/Jer32:1-Jer32:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer32:1-Jer32:15)[15](https://ref.ly/Jer32:1-Jer32:15); [Hosea 3:4](https://ref.ly/Hos3:4-Hos3:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Hos3:4-Hos3:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Hos3:4-Hos3:5); [Joel 2:28](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)[29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29); [Hebrews 2:1](https://ref.ly/Hab2:1-Hab2:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Hab2:1-Hab2:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Hab2:1-Hab2:3); [Daniel 12:11](https://ref.ly/Dan12:11-Dan12:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan12:11-Dan12:13)[13](https://ref.ly/Dan12:11-Dan12:13)).

Perseverance in the New Testament
---------------------------------

The New Testament also encourages believers to keep persevering. The Greek word often used is *proskartereo*, which means "to attend continually or adhere steadfastly" ([Mark 3:9](https://ref.ly/Mark3:9); [Acts 8:13](https://ref.ly/Acts8:13); [10:7](https://ref.ly/Acts10:7); [Romans 13:6](https://ref.ly/Rom13:6)). This word is translated as "devoted," "continued," "constant," and "steadfast."

Perseverance in Faith
---------------------

The Bible teaches that we should keep going and not give up in many areas of our faith:

* In prayer ([Luke 18:1](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8); [Colossians 4:2](https://ref.ly/Col4:2))
* In doing good things ([Romans 2:7](https://ref.ly/Rom2:7); [Galatians 6:9](https://ref.ly/Gal6:9))
* In learning about Christianity ([Acts 2:42](https://ref.ly/Acts2:42); [2 Timothy 3:14](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:14))
* In difficult times ([2 Thessalonians 1:4](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:4))
* In grace ([Acts 13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43); [2 Corinthians 6:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:1))
* In faith ([Acts 14:22](https://ref.ly/Acts14:22); [Colossians 1:23](https://ref.ly/Col1:23))
* In divine love ([John 15:9](https://ref.ly/John15:9); [Jude 1:21](https://ref.ly/Jude1:21))
* In standing firm ([1 Corinthians 16:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:13); [2 Thessalonians 2:15](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:15))
* In abiding in Christ ([John 15:4](https://ref.ly/John15:4-John15:10)[–](https://ref.ly/John15:4-John15:10)[10](https://ref.ly/John15:4-John15:10); [1 John 2:28](https://ref.ly/1John2:28))
* In running with patience ([Hebrews 6:12](https://ref.ly/Heb6:12); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1))
* In not falling away ([Hebrews 3:12](https://ref.ly/Heb3:12); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:10)[10](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:10))
* In being zealous to confirm our call and election ([2 Peter 1:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:10))

Examples of Failing to Persevere
--------------------------------

Some people failed to persevere, such as:

* Judas ([John 6:71](https://ref.ly/John6:71))

* Demas ([2 Timothy 4:10](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:10))
* Hymenaeus ([2 Timothy 2:17](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:17))

Warnings About Lack of Perseverance
-----------------------------------

We should not ignore the possibility of:

* "neglecting so great a salvation" ([Hebrews 2:3](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3))
* being "disqualified" ([1 Corinthians 9:27](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:27))
* "falling" while we think we are "standing" ([1 Corinthians 10:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:12)).
* committing apostasy by turning away from God completely ([Hebrews 6:1](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8))

Importance of Perseverance
--------------------------

For, as Jesus said, “The one who perseveres to the end will be saved” ([Matthew 10:22](https://ref.ly/Matt10:22); [24:13](https://ref.ly/Matt24:13)). This emphasis is not accidental. It reflects the pressures of pagan society, the danger of persecution, emotional reactions after initial spiritual experiences, and the misunderstanding of "instant salvation." Christians must understand that endurance is key to inheriting eternal salvation ([Luke 21:19](https://ref.ly/Luke21:19); [Romans 5:3](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3); [Colossians 1:11](https://ref.ly/Col1:11)).

God's Role in Perseverance
--------------------------

However, perseverance is not solely dependent on human effort. In the Old Testament, God's redeeming purpose is unwavering, and His covenant stands firm, though it needs renewal ([Jeremiah 31:31](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)[34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)). Divine love (*hesed* in Hebrew) means changeless loyalty. God will never fail or forsake His people for His own name’s sake. 

The New Testament promises that Christ will raise his followers on the last day, and no one can take them from his or the Father’s hand. Christ will keep us from falling, and God is faithful, working in us for his good purpose. He will not let us be tempted beyond what we can handle. Nothing in heaven or on earth can separate us from God’s love. We are already sealed by the Holy Spirit as a promise of eternal salvation and are protected by God's power for a future salvation that will be revealed.

The Bible teaches that believers should keep going in their faith but also assures them of their salvation. This can seem like a contradiction and has led to many debates. However, this tension is often understood better through personal spiritual experience rather than just by thinking about it.
