## Tirzah (Person) (id: 8865)

TIRZAH (Person)
===============

Tirzah was one of the daughters of Zelophehad from the tribe of Manasseh ([Numbers 26:33](https://ref.ly/Num26:33)). Since her father had no sons, she and her sisters asked for and received the inheritance of their father ([Numbers 27:1](https://ref.ly/Num27:1); [Joshua 17:3](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3)). This situation led to the creation of a new law about inheritance rights. The law stated that daughters who received their families' inheritance must marry someone from within their own tribe ([Numbers 36:11](https://ref.ly/Num36:11)).
