## Nebaioth (id: 7324)

NEBAIOTH
========

The firstborn of Ishmael's 12 sons ([Genesis 25:13](https://ref.ly/Gen25:13); [1 Chronicles 1:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:29)). His sister was Mahalath, who was also called “Basemath” (compare [Genesis 36:3](https://ref.ly/Gen36:3)). She later married Esau ([Genesis 28:9](https://ref.ly/Gen28:9)). 

The identity of Nebaioth's descendants is uncertain. They might be the ancestors of the Nabatean Arabian tribe who owned the land of Edom and parts of the area east of the Jordan River (Transjordan) as far north as Palmyra (ancient Tadmor). The descendants of both Nebaioth and Kedar are known for their excellent flocks of sheep ([Isaiah 60:7](https://ref.ly/Isa60:7)). They are also mentioned in the writings of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, who lived in the seventh century BC.
