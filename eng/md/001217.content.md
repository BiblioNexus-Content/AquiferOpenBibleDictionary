## Chalphi (id: 4470)

CHALPHI
=======

Chalphi was the father of Judas. This Judas was one of two captains in Jonathan Maccabeus’s army. 

During the battle of Gennesaret, the army was ambushed. Many soldiers ran away, but Judas and the other captain, Mattathias, stayed and fought bravely ([1 Maccabees 11:67–74](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:67-1Macc11:74)). Jonathan, Judas, and Mattathias encouraged the troops. Together, they drove back the enemy.
