## Hacmonite (id: 5565)

HACMONITE
=========

A title for Jashobeam. [2 Samuel 23:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8) calls him "Josheb\-basshebeth." He was one of the personal guards of King David ([1 Chronicles 11:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:11)). He is also called Tahchemonite in [2 Samuel 23:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:8), but this probably a textual error.

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 23:8; 1CH 11:11
