## Great Owl (id: 5534)

GREAT OWL
=========

The great owl (*Asio otus*) is a large owl that stands about 61 centimeters tall (nearly two feet). Its feathers are gray with brown spots and black stripes. It has two tufts on its head that look like ears. Because of these, it is also called the great horned owl.

This owl mostly eats rodents like rats and mice. In winter, it is often found in Israel, living in old ruins or among trees.

The great owl may be one of the birds Isaiah described as living in destroyed places, like Edom ([Isaiah 34:11](https://ref.ly/Isa34:11)). It is also listed as an unclean bird in Jewish law in some Bible translations ([Leviticus 11:17](https://ref.ly/Lev11:17); [Deuteronomy 14:16](https://ref.ly/Deut14:16)).
