## Ben-Ammi (id: 4099)

BEN\-AMMI
=========

The son of Lot and his younger daughter. A similar incestuous relationship between Lot and his older daughter produced a son named Moab. The two sons are both considered the ancestors of the Ammonite and Moabite peoples ([Genesis 19:38](https://ref.ly/Gen19:38)).

Although Lot could have shared in the promise made to Abraham ([Genesis 11:31](https://ref.ly/Gen11:31); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:4)), he chose to go his own way ([13:2](https://ref.ly/Gen13:2-Gen13:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen13:2-Gen13:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Gen13:2-Gen13:12)) and failed to trust the Lord ([19:15](https://ref.ly/Gen19:15-Gen19:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen19:15-Gen19:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Gen19:15-Gen19:23)). However, because of his relationship with Abraham, the Israelites treated Lot’s descendants with respect, despite the Ammonites and Moabites sometimes being strong enemies of Israel ([2 Chronicles 20:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:1-2Chr20:12)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:1-2Chr20:12)[12](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:1-2Chr20:12)).
