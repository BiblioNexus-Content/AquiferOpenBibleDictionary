## Ospray, Osprey (id: 7526)

OSPRAY, OSPREY
==============

A large bird of prey (*Pandion haliaetus*) that eats fish. It has brown feathers on its back and white feathers on its head and underside. Ospreys catch fish by diving into the water with their sharp talons.

In [Leviticus 11:13](https://ref.ly/Lev11:13) and [Deuteronomy 14:12](https://ref.ly/Deut14:12), some older Bible translations use the word *osprey*, but the Hebrew word probably refers to the black vulture. In modern bird science, the osprey is different from the black vulture (*Aegypius monachus*).

*See also* Birds; Vulture.
