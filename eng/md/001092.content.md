## Brook of the Arabah (id: 4348)

BROOK OF THE ARABAH
===================

A brook (flowing stream) that flows into the Arabah ([Amos 6:14](https://ref.ly/Amos6:14)). The exact location of this brook is not known.

The Arabah is a long valley of desert land that stretches from the Sea of Galilee to East Africa. There is a wadi (dry riverbed that fills with water during rains) named Arabah south of the Dead Sea. 

In the Bible, the word Arabah means “desert” or “wilderness.” In can refer to parts of the Jordan Valley ([Deuteronomy 4:48–49](https://ref.ly/Deut4:48-Deut4:49); [Joshua 8:14](https://ref.ly/Josh8:14); [2 Kings 25:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:4)). It can also refer to parts of the Salt Sea ([Deuteronomy 3:17](https://ref.ly/Deut3:17)). 

In the Wadi Arabah, water flows into the Salt Sea from several springs and streams that form when it rains.
