## Adam, the Second (id: 3365)

ADAM, The Second
================

An analogy that compares the first man, Adam, with the Lord Jesus Christ.

Two important biblical passages explain this idea. Where Adam’s sin brought terrible results for humanity, the perfect work of Jesus Christ was the cure for humanity's problem ([Romans 5:12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21)–[21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21); [1 Corinthians 15:22, 45](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22,1Cor15:45-1Cor15:49)–[49](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22,1Cor15:45-1Cor15:49)).
