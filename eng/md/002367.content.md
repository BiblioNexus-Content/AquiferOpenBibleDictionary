HAMMATH (Place)
===============

Fortified outpost identified with the modern Hamman Tabariyeh ([Jos 19:35](https://ref.ly/Josh19:35)). This place is located among hot springs on the western shore of Galilee and is probably identifiable with Hammon ([1 Chr 6:76](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:76)), Hammoth\-dor ([Jos 21:32](https://ref.ly/Josh21:32)), and perhaps the Emmaus of Josephus (*Antiquities* 18\.2\.3\).
