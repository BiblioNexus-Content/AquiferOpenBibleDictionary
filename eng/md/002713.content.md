## Huzzab (id: 5961)

HUZZAB\*
========

Obscure Hebrew word found only in [Nahum 2:7](https://ref.ly/Nah2:7) (kjv). Scholars are uncertain whether the word is a verb meaning “it is decreed,” a noun personifying Nineveh, or a reference to an Assyrian queen. The problem is perhaps due to textual error, but thus far neither textual scholarship nor archaeology has been able to resolve the question.

* **Associated Passages:** NAM 2:7
