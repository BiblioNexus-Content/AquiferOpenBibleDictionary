## Metheg-ammah (id: 7093)

METHEG\-AMMAH
=============

A place was a place conquered by King David ([2 Samuel 8:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:1)). The name means "Bridle of the Mother City." This place was most likely the Philistine capital city called Gath ([1 Chronicles 18:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:1)). In ancient times, people often called a capital city a "mother" city and the smaller surrounding cities were called "daughters." The word "bridle" in the name shows control or authority, meaning that whoever controlled this city had power over the whole region.
