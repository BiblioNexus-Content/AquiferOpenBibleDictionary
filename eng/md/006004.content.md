## Zoar (id: 9250)

ZOAR
====

One of the “cities of the plain” confederate with Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim ([Gn 14:2, 8](https://ref.ly/Gen14:2,Gen14:8)). Zoar, also known by its earlier name Bela, is best known as the town that served as a temporary refuge for Lot and his daughters during the destruction of Sodom and the other cities of the plain ([19:22–23, 30](https://ref.ly/Gen19:22-Gen19:23,Gen19:30)). Despite the fact that Zoar was evidently a small town (v [22](https://ref.ly/Gen19:22); Zoar means “little”), this place was evidently considered a significant geographical landmark in ancient times. When Abraham and Lot divided the land, Lot selected the land close to Zoar ([13:10](https://ref.ly/Gen13:10)). When Moses surveyed the Promised Land from Mt Pisgah, Zoar was reckoned as the southern terminus of the plain of the valley of Jericho ([Dt 34:3](https://ref.ly/Deut34:3)). During the prophetic period, Zoar was evidently considered to be on the southern boundary of Moab ([Is 15:5](https://ref.ly/Isa15:5); [Jer 48:4, 34](https://ref.ly/Jer48:4,Jer48:34)).
