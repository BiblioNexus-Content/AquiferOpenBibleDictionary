## Salim (id: 8105)

SALIM
=====

Location near Aenon on the west side of the Jordan River. Aenon was known for its many springs and was used by John as a place for baptism ([Jn 3:23](https://ref.ly/John3:23)). Its location is not certain. Some scholars agree with Eusebius (an early church father) that its location was about seven miles (11\.3 kilometers) south of Scythopolis (Beth\-shan) in the Decapolis region. Others suggest it was the Salim east of Nablus near Shechem in Samaria, or perhaps the Wadi Saleim, six miles (9\.7 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem.
