## Queen (id: 7885)

QUEEN
=====

A word used to describe a reigning monarch, a queen consort, or a queen mother. 

The queen of Sheba was the world's richest woman. She became so after visiting King Solomon's luxurious court ([1 Kings 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:1); [Matthew 12:42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:42); [Luke 11:31](https://ref.ly/Luke11:31)). She arrived with a large retinue and camels bearing gold, jewels, and spices. Candace, queen of Ethiopia, is mentioned in [Acts 8:27](https://ref.ly/Acts8:27). A eunuch, a senior minister in her court, was converted by Philip while visiting Jerusalem.

In Jewish history, Athaliah reigned for six years. She thought she had killed all rival claimants to the throne in the royal family ([2 Kings 11:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:3)). Also, Salome Alexandra succeeded her husband, Alexander Janneus, as ruler from 76 to 67 BC. A queen consort usually played a minor role. Two exceptions are Bathsheba ([1 Kings 1:15–31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:15-1Kgs1:31)) and Jezebel ([1 Kings 21:1–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:29)). Bathsheba wanted her son to succeed to the throne. Jezebel plotted a false accusation that led to Naboth's death. 

The queen mother played a powerful role. She not only ruled over the royal household but also was held in respect both by the court and by the monarch (compare [Exodus 20:12](https://ref.ly/Exod20:12)). Her requests were unlikely to be denied ([1 Kings 2:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:20)). As the king's mother, she was unique. His wives shared their position with others. Maacah, queen mother of Abijam, even retained her authority during much of her grandson’s reign ([1 Kings 15:2, 10, 13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:2); [2 Chronicles 15:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr15:16)). The queen mother was crowned ([Jeremiah 13:18](https://ref.ly/Jer13:18)). Bathsheba, now queen, was powerful enough to sit at King Solomon's right hand ([1 Kings 2:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:19)).
