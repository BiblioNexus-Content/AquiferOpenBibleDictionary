## Mount Pisgah (id: 7745)

MOUNT PISGAH
============

A mountain located at the northeast end of the Dead Sea near the ancient city of Jericho. King Balak took the fortuneteller Balaam to the top of Pisgah ([Numbers 23:14](https://ref.ly/Num23:14)). God told Moses to go to its summit to view the promised land ([Deuteronomy 3:27](https://ref.ly/Deut3:27)). Later, Moses returned to the top of Pisgah to die ([34:1](https://ref.ly/Deut34:1)). 

The slopes of Pisgah border the Dead Sea, also known as the Sea of the Arabah ([Deuteronomy](https://ref.ly/Deut3:27) [3:17](https://ref.ly/Deut3:17); [4:49](https://ref.ly/Deut4:49); [Joshua 12:3](https://ref.ly/Josh12:3); [13:20](https://ref.ly/Josh13:20)). The King James Version sometimes refers to these slopes as “Ashdoth\-pisgah.” Many scholars identify Mount Pisgah with modern, Ras es\-Siyaghah, north of Mount Nebo.
