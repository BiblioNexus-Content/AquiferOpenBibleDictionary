A shrine to the Philistine and Canaanite god Dagon. It is mentioned in several texts other than the Bible. A fortress called Dagon near Jericho was mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus, for example. Many Canaanite areas had shrines to Dagon:

A temple in Ashdod ([1 Samuel 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:2)[–](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:2)[2](https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam5:2); called Azotus in [1 Maccabees 10:83](https://ref.ly/1Macc10:83-1Macc10:84)[–](https://ref.ly/1Macc10:83-1Macc10:84)[84](https://ref.ly/1Macc10:83-1Macc10:84)).
