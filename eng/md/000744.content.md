## Barnabas (id: 4012)

BARNABAS
========

Barnabas was an early Christian convert in Jerusalem. He was originally named Joseph. Barnabas earned his new name through his influential preaching and teaching.

Background and Early Life
-------------------------

We learn most about Barnabas from the book of Acts and Paul's letters in the Bible. The "Epistle of Barnabas," written in the mid\-second century, is not from him. Likewise, the "Acts of Barnabas," a fifth\-century text, does not provide reliable information about him. Tertullian mistakenly claimed Hebrews was written by Barnabas, but this claim lacks supporting evidence.

Barnabas was a Jew from Cyprus. He came from a family of priests, which likely influenced his interest in Jerusalem. He probably moved to Jerusalem and may have met Jesus, but his conversion to Christianity was likely through the apostles' teaching after Christ’s resurrection.

Missionary Journeys with Paul
-----------------------------

Barnabas first appears in Acts as Joseph, who sold a field and donated the money to the Christian community ([Acts 4:36](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36-Acts4:37)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36-Acts4:37)[37](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36-Acts4:37)). When persecution hit Jerusalem and people were attacked for their beliefs, Barnabas stayed in the city, unlike others who fled ([Acts 8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:8); [11:19](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:22)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:22)[22](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:22)). His good reputation may have led the apostles to choose him as a companion for Paul’s missionary work (to spread the gospel).

As Christians fled to Antioch in Syria, the Jerusalem church sent Barnabas there to assist with the growing Christian community ([Acts 11:19](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:26)[26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:26)). The writer of Acts said that Barnabas “was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith” ([Acts 11:24](https://ref.ly/Acts11:24)). Barnabas recruited Paul to help in Antioch. They worked together for a year, teaching many Christians ([Acts 11:26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:26)). During a famine in Jerusalem, Barnabas and Paul took relief funds back to the city, and John Mark joined them on their return to Antioch ([Acts 12:25](https://ref.ly/Acts12:25)).

Barnabas and Paul were later sent to spread the Christian message beyond Antioch ([Acts 13:2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2-Acts13:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2-Acts13:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2-Acts13:3)). At this point, Barnabas's name is listed first, possibly indicating his leading role. They traveled to Cyprus and several key locations in Asia Minor. In Lystra, the people mistook Barnabas for the god Zeus and Paul for Hermes ([Acts 14:8](https://ref.ly/Acts14:8-Acts14:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts14:8-Acts14:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Acts14:8-Acts14:12)). This shows how impressive they seemed to the people there.

Barnabas and Paul Separate
--------------------------

At a Jerusalem council, Barnabas and Paul reported on their mission to the gentiles ([Acts 15](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1-Acts15:41)). Following that council, as the two men planned another mission, a serious disagreement arose that led to their separation ([Acts 15:36](https://ref.ly/Acts15:36-Acts15:41)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts15:36-Acts15:41)[41](https://ref.ly/Acts15:36-Acts15:41)). Barnabas wanted to take his cousin John Mark ([Colossians 4:10](https://ref.ly/Col4:10)), but Paul refused because Mark had deserted them on the earlier mission ([Acts 13:13](https://ref.ly/Acts13:13)). Barnabas and John Mark went to Cyprus, while Paul traveled with Silas to Syria and Cilicia. After this split, the focus of the narrative shifts from Barnabas to Paul.
