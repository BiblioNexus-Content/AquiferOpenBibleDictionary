## The Book of Elchasai (id: 4972)

THE BOOK OF ELCHASAI
====================

A lost Jewish work written in Aramaic. It was written by Elchasai during the reign of Emperor Trajan. Trajan was emperor of Rome from AD 98 to 117\. The book of Elchasai was meant for his followers, the Elchasaites (or Sabai), but was read by both Jews and Jewish\-Christian groups. Portions of the book are quoted by early church fathers Hippolytus, Epiphanius, and Origen (quoted in Eusebius).

The book mixes Jewish, Christian, gnostic, and pagan ideas. Baptism is linked to forgiveness of sins and is a way a person can be healed. It requires a form of Jewish legalism but rejects the need for sacrifices and a priesthood.
