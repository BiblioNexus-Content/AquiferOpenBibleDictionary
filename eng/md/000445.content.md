ARBATTA
=======

A region south of the Esdraelon Valley in the southwest corner of Galilee. The residents were threatened by non\-Jewish forces of Ptolemais, Tyre, and Sidon ([1 Maccabees 5:15](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:15)). They sent for help by letter from Judas Maccabeus, and Judas sent his brother Simon with 3,000 men. They rescued the Galileans and "led them into Judea with great rejoicing" ([1 Maccabees 5:23](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:23)).
