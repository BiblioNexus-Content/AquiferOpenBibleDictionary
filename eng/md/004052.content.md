## Nard, Spikenard (id: 7310)

NARD, SPIKENARD
===============

A perennial herb with strong, fragrant roots. It grows naturally at high elevations in the Himalaya mountains and extends into western Asia. People dry the roots and the fuzzy, spike\-shaped young stems before the leaves open. These dried parts are used to make perfume.

In India, people still use nard as a perfume for hair. There is good evidence that the spikenard mentioned in the Bible originally came from India ([Song of Solomon 1:12](https://ref.ly/Song1:12); [4:13–14](https://ref.ly/Song4:13-Song4:14); [Mark 14:3](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3); [John 12:3](https://ref.ly/John12:3)).
