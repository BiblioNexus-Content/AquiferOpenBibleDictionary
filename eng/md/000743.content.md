## Barn Owl, White Owl (id: 787492)

BARN OWL, WHITE OWL
===================

The barn owl (*Tyto alba*) is a large owl known for its heart\-shaped face. Some people call it the “snoring owl” because of the sound it makes when breathing in its nest. Others call it the “screech owl” because of its loud, frightening cry when it flies.

Its big head and wide eyes have made some people think it looks scary or even evil. Because of its face, others call it the “monkey\-faced owl.”

Even though some people think this owl looks strange, it is a helpful bird. It hunts and eats rodents (like rats and mice) that ruin crops and eat stored food. This makes the barn owl good for farmers.

Like other owls, the barn owl sleeps during the day and hunts at night. It has very good hearing and eyesight, which help it catch prey in the dark.

The barn owl has light brownish\-yellow feathers. Its face is white, and there is a white “mask” around its eyes and cheeks. Its legs are fully covered in feathers. These feathers help protect the owl from bites when it catches prey with its sharp claws (called talons).

Barn Owls in the Bible
----------------------

Some modern Bible translations mention the barn or white owl by name ([Leviticus 11:17–18](https://ref.ly/Lev11:17-Lev11:18); [Deuteronomy 14:16](https://ref.ly/Deut14:16)). These owls are listed as unclean birds in Jewish law, meaning they were not allowed to be eaten.
