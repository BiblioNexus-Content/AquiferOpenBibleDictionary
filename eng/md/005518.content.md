## Teman (Place) (id: 8777)

TEMAN (Place)
=============

In the prophetic writings, Teman seems to have been considered the principal city of Edom and is often used as a poetic parallel for the entire land of Edom ([Jer 49:7, 20](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7,Jer49:20); [Am 1:12](https://ref.ly/Amos1:12); [Ob 1:9](https://ref.ly/Obad1:9)). Since Teman means “south,” it is likely that Teman was located in the far south of Edom; however, its precise location remains unknown. The residents of Teman were evidently well known for their wisdom ([Jer 49:7](https://ref.ly/Jer49:7); [Ob 1:9](https://ref.ly/Obad1:9)). This reputation may well derive from Eliphaz the Temanite, who was one of Job’s counselors ([Jb 2:11, 4:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:11,Job2:4); [15:1](https://ref.ly/Job15:1); [22:1](https://ref.ly/Job22:1); [42:7–9](https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:9)).
