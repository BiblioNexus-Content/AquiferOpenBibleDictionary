## God-Fearer (id: 5498)

GOD\-FEARER
===========

Someone who has a deep respect, reverence, or fear of God. This fear can be: 

* A term of respect
* An emotional reaction of terror
* A fear of God’s punishment

In the Old Testament, phrases describing a God\-fearer are often paired with terms like “stood in awe” or “held in awe." Reverence for the Lord is less common but is used when Obadiah hid the prophets to save them from Jezebel ([1 Kings 18:3–4, 12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:3-1Kgs18:4)). A God\-fearing ruler was expected to provide justice ([2 Samuel 23:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:3); [2 Chronicles 19:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr19:7)). Long life was promised to those who feared the Lord ([Proverbs 10:27](https://ref.ly/Prov10:27); [14:27](https://ref.ly/Prov14:27); [19:23](https://ref.ly/Prov19:23)). A God\-fearing family would rely on the Lord for help during trouble ([2 Kings 4:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:1); [Proverbs 14:26](https://ref.ly/Prov14:26)). The fear of the Lord was powerful in driving away sin and was the beginning of wisdom ([Wisdom of Solomon 10:13](https://ref.ly/Wis10:13)).

In the New Testament, fear of God often accompanies instructions to love and serve the Lord ([Colossians 3:22](https://ref.ly/Col3:22); [1 Peter 2:17](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:17)). In [Luke 1:50](https://ref.ly/Luke1:50), Mary’s statement “His mercy extends to those who fear Him” means to revere and obey. In Acts, the term “God\-fearer” refers to gentiles who attended the synagogue. Paul addresses them separately: “Men of Israel and you gentiles who fear God” ([Acts 13:16](https://ref.ly/Acts13:16)). Cornelius was a God\-fearing Roman centurion, recognized as leading a life acceptable to the Lord, even though he was not a Jew ([Acts 10:2, 35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:2)).

The fear of God also represents dread or terror of God’s power and judgment, as seen in both the Old and New Testaments ([Genesis 3:10](https://ref.ly/Gen3:10); [Deuteronomy 9:19](https://ref.ly/Deut9:19); [Job 6:4](https://ref.ly/Job6:4); [9:28–29](https://ref.ly/Job9:28-Job9:29); [Psalm 76:8](https://ref.ly/Ps76:8); [Matthew 17:7](https://ref.ly/Matt17:7); [28:10](https://ref.ly/Matt28:10); [Luke 5:10](https://ref.ly/Luke5:10); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Luke12:5); [Acts 5:5, 11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:5); [1 Timothy 5:20](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:20)).
