## Sea of Glass (id: 8186)

SEA OF GLASS
============

A body of water in the vision of heaven described by John in the book of Revelation ([Rv 4:6](https://ref.ly/Rev4:6)). It appears again later, in a different vision ([15:2](https://ref.ly/Rev15:2)), and is perhaps connected with other “sea” references in the same book ([13:1](https://ref.ly/Rev13:1); [21:1](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1)). It probably depicts the vast expanse before God’s throne. The crystal clearness of this sea may symbolize that everything is translucent and revealed in the presence of God.
