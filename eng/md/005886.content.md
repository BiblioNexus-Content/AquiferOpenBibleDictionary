## Zalmon (Place) (id: 9132)

ZALMON (Place)
==============

Mountain from which Abimelech took brush to burn down the tower of Shechem ([Jgs 9:48](https://ref.ly/Judg9:48)). Since the mountain obviously was close to Shechem, it tentatively has been identified with es\-Sulemiyeh (the modern name for the southeastern portion of Mt Ebal) or one of its surrounding hills. Zalmon is also mentioned in connection with the defeat of Israel’s enemies in [Psalm 68:14](https://ref.ly/Ps68:14). Because of the mention of snowfall and the “mighty mountain of Bashan” in the following verse, the Septuagint and some commentators consider this Zalmon to be Mt Hermon in Lebanon. However, seasonal snowfalls also occur in the region of Mt Ebal.
