## Nurse (id: 7436)

NURSE
=====

A nurse was a woman who took care of an infant that was not her own, or a man who took care of young children. The work focused on feeding and caring for an infant. Most women took care of their own children, like Sarah and Hannah ([Genesis 21:7](https://ref.ly/Gen21:7); [1 Samuel 1:23](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:23)). 

A wet nurse (a woman who breastfeeds another woman's child) often became part of the family and had a special position. Rebekah had a nurse, and when this woman died, she was even mentioned in the Bible: “Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon\-bachuth” ([Genesis 35:8](https://ref.ly/Gen35:8)). 

Moses's mother became his nurse when Pharaoh's daughter paid her to care for him ([Exodus 2:7](https://ref.ly/Exod2:7)). Royal sons were cared for by nurses, as in the case of Joash. His aunt Jehosheba hid him with his nurse ([2 Kings 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2)). Since Joash was hidden for six years and was seven when he became king, he was about one year old when he was hidden. His nurse must have been a wet nurse.

Royal sons received special care and were supervised by a nurse after they finished breastfeeding. Children were nursed until about three years old, and when they were weaned (stopped breastfeeding), there was a feast ([Genesis 21:8](https://ref.ly/Gen21:8); [1 Samuel 1:23–24](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:23-1Sam1:24)). After weaning, a nurse\-teacher took charge of the child. Mephibosheth was five years old when his nurse fell while carrying him. This caused him to be unable to walk properly ([2 Samuel 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:4)). Naomi took care of her grandson as a nurse ([Ruth 4:16](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:16)). 

It is likely that male nurses worked as teachers for young nobles. For example, [2 Kings 10:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:1) says that Ahab’s children had tutors (compare [2 Kings 10:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:5)). In this way, we should understand Moses's reference to himself as a “nurse”: “Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers?” ([Numbers 11:12](https://ref.ly/Num11:12)). Paul also saw himself as a “nurse” to the church ([1 Thessalonians 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:7)).
