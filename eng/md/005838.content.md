WIZARD
======

A wizard is a man who claims to have special knowledge or power through magic or contact with spirits. Wizards in the Bible were often linked with fortune\-telling or calling on the dead. These practices were forbidden in Israel ([Deuteronomy 18:10–12](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10-Deut18:12)).
