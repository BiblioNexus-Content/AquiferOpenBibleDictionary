## Brook of the Willows (id: 9068)

BROOK OF THE WILLOWS
====================

A stream or small valley mentioned in [Isaiah 15:7](https://ref.ly/Isa15:7). It is also called the "Ravine of the Willows." It was probably on the southern border of Moab. The verse says that Moab’s wealth would be carried away along this brook. 

Some Bible translations call it the “Ravine of the Poplars” because the exact tree meant is uncertain.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 15:7
