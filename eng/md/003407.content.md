## Lahmi (id: 6664)

LAHMI
=====

A brother of Goliath the Gittite. According to [1 Chronicles 20:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5), Elhanan killed Lahmi. But [2 Samuel 21:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19) says that Elhanan killed Goliath rather than his brother Lahmi. Most interpreters accept the 1 Chronicles passage as the correct reading. They consider the 2 Samuel text to be a textual corruption.
