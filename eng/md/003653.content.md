## Mamre (Place) (id: 6912)

MAMRE (Place)
=============

Important oak grove near which Abraham lived, and named for an Amorite who helped him defeat Chedorlaomer and rescue Lot ([Gn 14:13, 24](https://ref.ly/Gen14:13,Gen14:24)). Abraham erected an altar under the oak of Mamre ([13:18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:18)). Abraham was sitting by the sacred tree when he welcomed three mysterious guests (ch [18](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:33)). Mamre is also a possible site for the scene of Abrahamic covenant ceremonies (ch [15](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21)). Isaac and Jacob also lived there ([35:27](https://ref.ly/Gen35:27)).
