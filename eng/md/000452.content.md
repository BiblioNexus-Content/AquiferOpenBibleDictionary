## Archer, Archery (id: 3716)

ARCHER, ARCHERY
===============

Archers used bows and arrows in both peace and war. Nomads, hunters, attackers who stole from others, and warriors ([Genesis 21:20](https://ref.ly/Gen21:20); [27:3](https://ref.ly/Gen27:3); [48:22](https://ref.ly/Gen48:22);[Joshua 24:12](https://ref.ly/Josh24:12); [Isaiah 7:24](https://ref.ly/Isa7:24); [Ezekiel 39:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:9); [Hosea 1:7](https://ref.ly/Hos1:7)) used archery for hunting and fighting throughout the Bible. 

Over centuries of use, people improved how well a bow and arrow worked. The finest bow was the “composite bow.” Makers glued strips of animal sinew to the ends of the bow, and animal horn to the inner surface. The best of these bows could fire arrows from 274 to 366 meters 9 (300 to 400 yards). An archer needed to be a strong person to string and operate it.

While archers used bows for hunting, the weapon was most useful in war. Saul and Jonathan fought with sword and bow, and David’s army included skilled bowmen (([1 Samuel 18:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:4); [1 Chronicles 12:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:2)). The kings of Israel provided troops with bows ([2 Chronicles 17:17](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:17)). Israel’s enemies, including Egyptians, Syrians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, all indicate archers among their armies. Excellent images of historical archers still exist in sculpture.

Job described his physical sufferings metaphorically as God’s archers surrounding him ([Job 16:13](https://ref.ly/Job16:13)). Some Psalms refer to an archer’s bow as a metaphor for violence ([Psalms 11:2](https://ref.ly/Ps11:2); [57:4](https://ref.ly/Ps57:4)). Others refer to an archer's bow as a metaphor for divine judgment ([Psalms 7:13](https://ref.ly/Ps7:13); [38:2](https://ref.ly/Ps38:2); [64:7](https://ref.ly/Ps64:7)).
