## Aijalon (id: 3475)

AIJALON
=======

1. A city located in a valley 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem (modern\-day Yalo).

    It was originally given to the tribe of Dan ([Joshua 19:42](https://ref.ly/Josh19:42)). Aijalon was made as one of four cities in Dan for Levites ([Joshua 21:24](https://ref.ly/Josh21:24)). Later, it became a city of refuge in the tribe of Ephraim ([1 Chronicles 6:69](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:69)). Dan had moved north, being unable to maintain its original territory, including Aijalon ([Judges 1:34](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:36)–[36](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:36)). Near Aijalon, Saul and Jonathan won a battle against the Philistines ([1 Samuel 14:31](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:31)). People from Benjamin's tribe also lived there at one point ([1 Chronicles 8:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:13)).

    After Solomon’s death, Israel split into two kingdoms. King Rehoboam strengthened Aijalon, as it was on the border of the two kingdoms ([2 Chronicles 11:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:10)). The Egyptian pharaoh Shishak claimed he conquered Aijalon around 924 BC ([2 Chronicles 12:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:2-2Chr12:12)–[12](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:2-2Chr12:12)). Much later, the Philistines took Aijalon during the reign of Ahaz ([2 Chronicles 28:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18)).

    The valley of Aijalon is famous for a battle where Joshua fought to control Gibeon ([Joshua 10:12](https://ref.ly/Josh10:12)). During this battle, Joshua prayed to God: “O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon” ([Joshua 10:12](https://ref.ly/Josh10:12)).

2. A city in the territory of Zebulun. The burial place of the judge Elon ([Judges 12:12](https://ref.ly/Judg12:12)).
