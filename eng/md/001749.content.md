## Eliashib (id: 4999)

ELIASHIB
========

1\. Elioenai’s son and a descendant of Zerubbabel in the royal lineage of David ([1 Chr 3:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:24)).

2\. Aaron’s descendant chosen by David to head the 11th of the 24 courses of priests taking turns in the sanctuary services ([1 Chr 24:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:12)).

3\. High priest in the second succession from Jeshua ([Neh 12:10](https://ref.ly/Neh12:10)). Eliashib assigned a chamber of the temple to Tobiah the Ammonite, a relative by marriage. When Nehemiah returned from exile, he had Tobiah removed from his temple lodging ([Ezr 10:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:6); [Neh 3:1, 20](https://ref.ly/Neh3:1,Neh3:20); [13:4, 7–8, 28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:4,Neh13:7-Neh13:8,Neh13:28)).

4\. Levite and temple singer. He pledged to put away his foreign wife at Ezra’s command ([Ezr 10:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:24)).

5, 6\. Two men, a son of Zattu and a son of Bani, similarly persuaded by Ezra to put away their foreign wives ([Ezr 10:27, 36](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:27,Ezra10:36)).
