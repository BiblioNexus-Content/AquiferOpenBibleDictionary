## Deuel (id: 4822)

DEUEL
=====

Deuel was the father of Eliasaph. Eliasaph led the tribe of Gad during the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites ([Numbers 1:14](https://ref.ly/Num1:14); [7:42, 47](https://ref.ly/Num7:42,Num7:47); [10:20](https://ref.ly/Num10:20)). In [Numbers 2:14](https://ref.ly/Num2:14), most manuscripts spell his name Reuel. Some others spell it Deuel. This is due to a confusing similarity between the Hebrew letters for “d” and “r.”
