## Abihu (id: 3300)

ABIHU
=====

The second son of Aaron and Elisheba ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23); [Numbers 26:60](https://ref.ly/Num26:60); [1 Chronicles 6:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3)). 

Abihu and his brother Nadab joined Moses, Aaron, and the 70 elders of Israel in worshiping the glory of God on Mount Sinai ([Exodus 24:1](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:11)–[11](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1-Exod24:11)). The four sons of Aaron were made priests with their father ([Exodus 28:1](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1)), but later Abihu and Nadab were burned to death for offering “unauthorized fire” before the Lord ([Leviticus 10:1](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1); see also [Numbers 3:2](https://ref.ly/Num3:2-Num3:4)–[4](https://ref.ly/Num3:2-Num3:4); [26:61](https://ref.ly/Num26:61); [1 Chronicles 24:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:1-1Chr24:2)–[2](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:1-1Chr24:2)).
