## Noah (id: 7413)

NOAH
====

1. Son of Lamech and the grandson of Methuselah, a descendant of Seth, third son of Adam ([Genesis 5:3](https://ref.ly/Gen5:3-Gen5:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen5:3-Gen5:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Gen5:3-Gen5:20)). Lamech named his son Noah, a name that sounds like a Hebrew term that can mean “relief” or “comfort.” When Lamech gave him this name, he said, “May this one comfort us in the labor and toil of our hands caused by the ground that the LORD has cursed” ([Genesis 5:29](https://ref.ly/Gen5:29)).

    Determined to destroy creation because of constant wickedness (compare [Matthew 24:37](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt24:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt24:39)[39](https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt24:39); [Luke 17:26](https://ref.ly/Luke17:26-Luke17:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke17:26-Luke17:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Luke17:26-Luke17:27)), God made an exception with Noah, a man righteous in God’s sight and blameless before people ([Genesis 6:3](https://ref.ly/Gen6:3-Gen6:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen6:3-Gen6:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Gen6:3-Gen6:9)). Noah followed God's precise instructions. He built an ark. Only eight people went inside:

    * Noah
        * His wife
        * His three sons
        * Their wives
        All kinds of creatures were brought in pairs. They were thus protected from the ensuing deluge in which all other living things perished ([Genesis 6:14–8:19](https://ref.ly/Gen6:14-Gen8:19)). After they left the ark, Noah built an altar. He sacrificed burnt offerings that pleased God. In response, God promised never to repeat the Flood or disrupt the seasons despite man's sin ([Genesis 8:20–9:17](https://ref.ly/Gen8:20-Gen9:17)).

    Noah had withstood mighty temptations. But, either through carelessness or old age, he became drunk. Reactions varied among family members, prompting individual assessments. Shem and Japheth received blessings. Ham received no blessing, but his son Canaan was cursed ([Genesis 9:20](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Gen9:20-Gen9:27)). Noah was 950 years old when he died, 350 years after the Flood.

    [Ezekiel 14:12](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:14,Ezek14:19-Ezek14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:14)[14, 19](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:14,Ezek14:19-Ezek14:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:14)[20](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:14,Ezek14:19-Ezek14:20) cites Noah, Daniel, and Job for "their righteousness." The Letter to the Hebrews commends Noah, who, by faith and holy fear, rejected the world and became the heir of righteousness ([Hebrews 11:7](https://ref.ly/Heb11:7)), and [2 Peter 2:5](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:5) calls him “a preacher of righteousness.”

2. Daughter of Zelophehad of Manasseh’s tribe ([Numbers 26:33](https://ref.ly/Num26:33)). When their father died without a son, she and her four sisters petitioned for a law to protect their inheritance rights ([Numbers 27:1](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Num27:1-Num27:11); compare [Joshua 17:3](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3-Josh17:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3-Josh17:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Josh17:3-Josh17:6)). They were, however, restricted to marrying within their own tribe ([Numbers 36:1](https://ref.ly/Num36:1-Num36:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Num36:1-Num36:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Num36:1-Num36:12)).
