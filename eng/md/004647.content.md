## Rahab (Monster) (id: 7909)

RAHAB (Monster)
===============

A mythological sea monster that symbolized Egypt ([Psalm 87:4](https://ref.ly/Ps87:4)). “Egypt’s help is futile and empty; therefore I have called her Rahab Who Sits Still” ([Isaiah 30:7](https://ref.ly/Isa30:7)). The writers of the Bible described how God helped the people of Israel cross the Red Sea while the Egyptian army drowned there (compare [Isaiah 51:10](https://ref.ly/Isa51:10)). They used the image of God fighting and defeating a powerful monster to tell this story ([Job 26:12](https://ref.ly/Job26:12); [Psalm 89:10](https://ref.ly/Ps89:10); [Isaiah 51:9](https://ref.ly/Isa51:9) ).
