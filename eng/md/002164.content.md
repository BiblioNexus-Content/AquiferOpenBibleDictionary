## Gentiles (id: 5420)

GENTILES
========

The nations or peoples who are not Jewish. In Hebrew, these people are called *goyim* (meaning "nations"). In Greek, they are called *ethnoi* (meaning "peoples"). The Old Testament divides all people into two groups: the Jewish people (whom God chose as his special people) and all other nations.

The New Testament teaches that God offers salvation to both Jew and gentile. Two important apostles, Peter and Paul, were the first to share the good news about Jesus with non\-Jewish people. Paul worked throughout his ministry to bring Jewish and non\-Jewish believers together as one group in the church.
