## Beth-Horon (id: 4182)

BETH\-HORON
===========

A Canaanite place name, perhaps meaning “the house of Hauron,” the god of the underworld. Beth\-horon was two towns located 16\.1 and 19\.3 kilometers (10 and 12 miles) northwest of Jerusalem. These towns were on the border between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin ([Joshua 16:3, 5](https://ref.ly/Josh16:3,Josh16:5)). The two settlements were important because they controlled the Aijalon Valley, a key ancient route that connected the Mediterranean coast to the interior hill country. The upper town guarded a strategic mountain pass. The town of Beth\-Horon in Ephraim, along with its surrounding fields, was given to the Levite family of Kohath ([Joshua 21:22](https://ref.ly/Josh21:22); [1 Chronicles 6:68](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:68)).

Many armies passed through the Aijalon Valley near Beth\-Horon. After Joshua defeated the Amorites at Gibeon, they fled past Beth\-Horon on “the day the sun stood still” ([Joshua 10:1](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:14)). A group of Philistines also passed through here to fight King Saul ([1 Samuel 13:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:18)). The Egyptian army under King Shishak also passed by Beth\-Horon, as recorded in his Karnak inscription. Syrian forces led by Seron ([1 Maccabees 3:13–24](https://ref.ly/1Macc3:13-1Macc3:24)) and Nicanor ([7:39–43](https://ref.ly/1Macc7:39-1Macc7:43)) were defeated by Judas Maccabeus at Beth\-Horon. Later, Roman troops led by Cestius were nearly destroyed by Jewish forces there, according to the Jewish historian Josephus.

Beth\-Horon was likely destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. Sheerah, the daughter of Beriah and granddaughter of Ephraim, is credited with building both the lower and upper towns of Beth\-Horon ([1 Chronicles 7:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:24)). King Solomon later strengthened both towns after nearby raids by an Egyptian pharaoh ([1 Kings 9:15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17)[17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15-1Kgs9:17); [2 Chronicles 8:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr8:5)). During the period between the two Testaments, the Syrian general Bacchides strengthened the defences of Beth\-Horon after battling Jonathan Maccabeus ([1 Maccabees 9:50](https://ref.ly/1Macc9:50)).
