## Huppim (id: 5948)

HUPPIM
======

Perhaps the son of Ir (Iri) and a descendant of Benjamin through Bela’s line ([Gn 46:21](https://ref.ly/Gen46:21); [1 Chr 7:12, 15](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:12,1Chr7:15)). Huppim is probably an alternate spelling of Hupham, the father of the Huphamite family from Benjamin’s tribe ([Nm 26:39](https://ref.ly/Num26:39)). His precise lineage is difficult to determine.
