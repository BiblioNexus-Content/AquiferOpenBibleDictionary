## Moses’ Seat (id: 7213)

MOSES’S SEAT
============

A phrase that appears only in [Matthew 23:2](https://ref.ly/Matt23:2). There, Jesus talks about the scribes and Pharisees sitting on Moses's Seat.

In Bible times, where someone sat often showed how important they were ([Matthew 23:6](https://ref.ly/Matt23:6)). Sitting on "Moses's Seat" meant having a respected position and the right to explain Moses's laws.

The scribes were seen as continuing Moses's authority. People looked to them to explain what Moses taught.

In [Matthew 23:2](https://ref.ly/Matt23:2), Jesus does not seem to question their right. He tells people to follow what the scribes and Pharisees say when they teach Moses's laws correctly. But Jesus warns people not to copy what these teachers do because the scribes and Pharisees do not practice what they preach.

At other times, Jesus spoke against the scribes' and Pharisees' traditions that did not match Moses's laws ([Matthew 15:3–6](https://ref.ly/Matt15:3-Matt15:6); [23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4), [16–22](https://ref.ly/Matt23:16-Matt23:22)).
