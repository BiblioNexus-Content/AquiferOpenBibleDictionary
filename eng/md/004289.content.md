## Paddan, Paddan-Aram (id: 7547)

PADDAN, PADDAN\-ARAM
====================

Northwestern Mesopotamian district whose name means “Field of Aram,” distinguishing this flatland from the mountainous regions to the north and east. Paddan\-aram is alternately called Paddan in [Genesis 48:7](https://ref.ly/Gen48:7), the “land of Aram” in [Hosea 12:12](https://ref.ly/Hos12:12), and Aram\-naharaim in [Genesis 24:10](https://ref.ly/Gen24:10) meaning “Aram of the two rivers” (see nlt mg). The two rivers probably referred to the Euphrates and Balih rivers, between which this tract of land was situated.
