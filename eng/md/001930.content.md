EUROCLYDON
==========

The King James Version transliteration of the Greek word for the powerful northeasterly wind mentioned during Paul's journey to Rome in [Acts 27:14](https://ref.ly/Acts27:14). This dangerous storm wind struck the ship suddenly after they sailed from the harbor of Fair Havens on the island of Crete. Modern Bible translations call this a "northeaster."
