## Talitha Cumi (id: 8721)

TALITHA CUMI
============

Jesus spoke these Aramaic words as recorded by Mark in his Gospel ([Mark 5:41](https://ref.ly/Mark5:41)). Jairus, a synagogue official in the Galilean region, called on Jesus to heal his sick daughter. The girl died before Jesus arrived. When he arrived, Jesus took the girl's hand and said, *"Talitha cumi,"* meaning "Little girl, arise." *"Talitha"* is a term of affection meaning "lamb" or "youth." *"Cumi"* is a command to rise up. Mark translated the word as "I say to you, arise!"

In his Gospel, Mark includes other Aramaic phrases Jesus spoke ([Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17); [5:41](https://ref.ly/Mark5:41); [7:11, 34](https://ref.ly/Mark7:11,Mark7:34); [11:9–10](https://ref.ly/Mark11:9-Mark11:10); [14:36](https://ref.ly/Mark14:36); [15:22, 34](https://ref.ly/Mark15:22,Mark15:34)). Matthew only records two Aramaic phrases ([Matthew 27:33, 46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:33,Matt27:46)). Luke's gospel includes none of these phrases.
