## Onan (id: 7494)

ONAN
====

Second son of Judah and a Canaanitess named Shua ([Gn 38:4–10](https://ref.ly/Gen38:4-Gen38:10); [46:12](https://ref.ly/Gen46:12); [Nm 26:19](https://ref.ly/Num26:19); [1 Chr 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3)). Judah forced him to enter into a levirate marriage with Tamar, the wife of his deceased brother, Er. Er and Tamar had no children. Onan refused to have children by Tamar, knowing that they would be heirs to his brother’s estate. As a result of Onan’s refusal to raise up descendants for his brother, the Lord punished him with death ([Gn 38:8–10](https://ref.ly/Gen38:8-Gen38:10)).
