## Ahihud (id: 3443)

AHIHUD
======

1. Shelomi’s son, a leader from the tribe of Asher. Ahihud helped Eleazar and Joshua divide the territory of Canaan between the Israelites ([Numbers 34:17, 27](https://ref.ly/Num34:17,Num34:27)).
2. Some English Bible versions (King James Version, Revised Standard Version) say Ahihud was a leader in the tribe of Benjamin. They say his father was Gera, also called Heglam, who was sent away to live in Manahath ([1 Chronicles 8:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:7)). 
  
But the Hebrew text (called the Masoretic Text) says Ahihud's father was Ehud. In this version, it was Gera who forced Ahihud and his mother to leave their home and go to Manahath ([1 Chronicles 8:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:6)).
