## Wild Gourd (id: 718558)

Wild Gourd
==========

The wild gourd appears in the Bible in [2 Kings 4:39](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:39), where one of Elisha's followers unknowingly gathered its fruit and added it to a stew during a famine. When people tasted it, they cried out, "There is death in the pot!" because of its extreme bitterness and potential toxicity. Most scholars identify this plant as *Citrullus colocynthis* (colocynth or bitter apple), a vine that spreads along the ground or climbs over shrubs and fences.

The colocynth fruit looks like a small, round gourd and contains a spongy, bitter pulp. In large amounts, it can cause severe stomach distress and act as a strong laxative.

Some scholars suggest that the bitterness of colocynth may explain why the Bible sometimes uses the word "gall" (*rosh* in Hebrew) as a symbol of extreme bitterness or poison ([Psalm 69:21](https://ref.ly/Ps69:21); [Lamentations 3:5, 19](https://ref.ly/Lam3:5,Lam3:19); [Matthew 27:34](https://ref.ly/Matt27:34)).
