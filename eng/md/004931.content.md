## Seba (id: 8198)

SEBA
====

A Semitic people descended from Cush ([Genesis 10:7](https://ref.ly/Gen10:7); [1 Chronicles 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:9); [Isaiah 43:3](https://ref.ly/Isa43:3)). Semitic people are ancient groups from the Middle East and North Africa, known for their shared languages (such as Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic) and cultural traditions. It is possible Seba could be the same as the people of Sheba.
