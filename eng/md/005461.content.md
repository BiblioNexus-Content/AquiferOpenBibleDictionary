1. A son of Anak and brother of Ahiman and Sheshai. The 12 Israelite spies saw Talmai and his people when they explored the land of Canaan ([Numbers 13:22](https://ref.ly/Num13:22)). Later, Caleb was successful in defeating Talmai and his brothers. They were living in Hebron ([Joshua 15:14](https://ref.ly/Josh15:14); [Judges 1:10](https://ref.ly/Judg1:10)).
2. A son of Ammihud and father of Maacah. Maacah was the wife of King David. She gave birth to Absalom, the third son of David ([2 Samuel 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:3); [1 Chronicles 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:2)). After Absalom killed his half\-brother Amnon, he ran away to his grandfather Talmai's small kingdom of Geshur for safety. ([2 Samuel 13:37](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:37)).
