## Onycha (id: 7503)

ONYCHA
======

One of the sweet spices used in the sacred incense of the tabernacle ([Exodus 30:34](https://ref.ly/Exod30:34)). It is unclear what precise spice this refers to. Some suggest that onycha came from the shell of a certain mussel found in India that smelled musky when burned.
