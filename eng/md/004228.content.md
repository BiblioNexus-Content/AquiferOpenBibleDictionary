## Omen (id: 7487)

OMEN
====

Natural sign or occurrence prefiguring the outcome of a future event. Augury was listed among the abominable pagan practices forbidden to Israel ([Dt 18:10](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10)). Balaam, upon seeing that the Lord was pleased with his blessings on Israel, did not seek omens as he normally did ([Nm 24:1](https://ref.ly/Num24:1)). The men of Syria looked for an omen to see if King Ahab of Israel (874–853 BC) would be favorably disposed to release the Syrian king Ben\-hadad from captivity ([1 Kgs 20:33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:33)). Isaiah reveals the Lord as one “who frustrates the omens of liars, and makes fools of diviners” ([Is 44:25](https://ref.ly/Isa44:25), rsv).
