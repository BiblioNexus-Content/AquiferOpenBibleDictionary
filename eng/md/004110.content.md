## Net (id: 7376)

NET
===

A net is a tool made of ropes or cords tied together to form a mesh (many open squares or holes). People used nets mostly for catching fish.

In Bible times, fishermen often used two kinds of nets. One kind was thrown by hand ([Matthew 4:18](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18)). The other kind was pulled between boats or dragged through the water ([John 21:6](https://ref.ly/John21:6)).

Nets were also used as a picture of danger or judgment. For example, the Bible says evil people will be caught in their own nets ([Ecclesiastes 9:12](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:12); [Ezekiel 12:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek12:13)). This means they will be trapped by their own plans.
