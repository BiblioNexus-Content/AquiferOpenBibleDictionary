## Apharsachites, Apharsathchites, Apharsites (id: 3653)

APHARSACHITES, APHARSATHCHITES, APHARSITES
==========================================

Three words used in the book of Ezra to designate certain groups of people in Samaria. These groups joined in writing King Artaxerxes of Babylon to stop the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. 

Apharsathchites could refer to a specific ethnic group or government leaders ([Ezra 4:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9), King James Version). A similar Old Persian word meant “messengers.” 

Apharsachites could be a shortened form of Apharsathchites ([Ezra 5:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:6); [6:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:6), King James Version). It could also be derived from an old Persian word for “investigators.” 

Apharsites is similar to the Hebrew word for “Persians” and has been translated that way ([Ezra 4:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9), King James Version).
