## Deformity (id: 4798)

DEFORMITY
=========

A visible difference in a person's body shape or structure that is not typical. It can be present from birth or caused by injury or disease.

Deformities and the Old Testament Sacrificial System
----------------------------------------------------

In the Old Testament sacrificial system, both the animal to be sacrificed and the priest who performed the sacrifice could not have defects or blemishes ([Leviticus 1:3](https://ref.ly/Lev1:3); [4:3;](https://ref.ly/Lev4:3) [21](https://ref.ly/Lev21:1-Lev21:24)). By being perfect, they are both examples in the Old Testament that point to Christ.

Eleven of the defects could exclude a man from becoming a priest ([Leviticus 21:17](https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/Lev21:17-Lev21:20)):

* Seven defects in the muscles or skeleton
* Two defects in the eyes
* One defect with the skin
* One defect in the reproductive system

Nose Deformities
----------------

[Leviticus 21:18](https://ref.ly/Lev21:18) mentions a condition that affects the nose, described as a "flat nose" in some translations or a "disfigurement" in others. This refers not to a common nose shape but a severe medical condition affecting the nose. Many genetic syndromes cause deformed noses, as do diseases like:

* Syphilis
* Tuberculosis
* Leprosy

These diseases can destroy the bone and cartilage support of the nose. With the support gone, the skin of the nose sinks inward. This condition causes a “saddle\-shaped” deformity in the nose.

Withered Arms and Hands
-----------------------

Both the Old and the New Testament describe an instance where a man has a “withered“ arm or hand. This is caused when the nerves supplying a limb are damaged, and the muscles decay. An injury, such as a sword striking an arm, can also cause this ([Zechariah 11:17](https://ref.ly/Zech11:17)). In the New Testament, Jesus instantly healed a man with a paralyzed hand ([Matthew 12:10](https://ref.ly/Matt12:10); [Mark 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mark3:1); [Luke 6:6](https://ref.ly/Luke6:6)).
