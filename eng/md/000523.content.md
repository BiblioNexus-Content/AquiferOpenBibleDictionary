## Ashan (id: 3790)

ASHAN
=====

A town in the southwestern Judean foothills slightly northwest of Beersheba. 

Ashan was originally in the tribe of Judah ([Joshua 15:42](https://ref.ly/Josh15:42)). Then it became Simeon’s ([Joshua 19:7](https://ref.ly/Josh19:7)). Finally, it was given to the Levites as a city of refuge ([1 Chronicles 6:59](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:59)). David traveled in that area with his group of men who were not following the law ([1 Samuel 30:30](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:30)). The city of Ain mentioned in [Joshua 21:16](https://ref.ly/Josh21:16) probably refers to Ashan (this is different than the Ain in the northeast of Canaan, [Numbers 34:11](https://ref.ly/Num34:11)).
