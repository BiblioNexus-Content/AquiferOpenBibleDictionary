## Beeroth (id: 4071)

BEEROTH
=======

One of four Hivite cities that Joshua promised to not destroy when the Israelites marched into Canaan ([Joshua 9:17](https://ref.ly/Josh9:17)). Beeroth was later listed as a city in Benjamin’s territory ([Joshua 18:25](https://ref.ly/Josh18:25); [2 Samuel 4:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:3)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:3)[3](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:3)). It was the home of Rechab and Baanah, the assassins of King Ishbosheth ([2 Samuel 4:2](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:9)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:9)[9](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:2-2Sam4:9)), and of Naharai, Joab’s armor bearer ([2 Samuel 23:37](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:37); [1 Chronicles 11:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:39)). People moved into the city after the exile in Babylon ([Ezra 2:25](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:25); [Nehemiah 7:29](https://ref.ly/Neh7:29)). Certain cities have been named as possible locations for Beeroth, including:

* El Bireh near Ramallah
* Nebi Samwil north of Jerusalem
