## Burnt Offering (id: 4365)

BURNT OFFERING
==============

A burnt offering was a type of sacrifice in ancient Israel. In this sacrifice, an animal without any defects was completely burned on the altar. None of the animal was eaten. It was entirely consumed by fire. The Israelites offered burnt offerings to seek forgiveness for sin and to restore their relationship with God ([Leviticus 1](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev1:17)).
