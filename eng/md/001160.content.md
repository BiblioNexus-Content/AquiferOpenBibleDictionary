## Caper Plant (id: 4416)

CAPER PLANT
===========

A low, spreading plant whose fruit was used to stimulate appetite. The caper (*Capparis sincula*) is a spiny, trailing shrub that grows in the Mediterranean region. [Ecclesiastes 12:5](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:5) mentions the caper berry.

The common caper or caper berry grows abundantly in Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the surrounding areas, and in the mountain valleys of Sinai. The plant sometimes grows upright but more often spreads weakly over the ground like a vine, covering rocks, ruins, and old walls similar to ivy. The young flower buds, pickled in vinegar, were used by ancient people as a condiment for meat. The berries were also used in cooking.
