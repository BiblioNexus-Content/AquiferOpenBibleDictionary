## Andrew, the Apostle (id: 3604)

ANDREW, The Apostle
===================

One of Jesus's 12 apostles (special messengers chosen by Jesus). 

Andrew's Early Life and Call to Follow Jesus
--------------------------------------------

Andrew first appears in the New Testament as a disciple of John the Baptist ([John 1:35](https://ref.ly/John1:35), [40](https://ref.ly/John1:40)). John said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” ([John 1:36](https://ref.ly/John1:36)), referring to Jesus. Andrew and another unnamed disciple followed Jesus and stayed with him for a day ([John 1:36–39](https://ref.ly/John1:36-John1:39)). Andrew then told his brother, Simon Peter, that he had found the Messiah (God's chosen leader) and brought Peter to Jesus ([John 1:40–42](https://ref.ly/John1:40-John1:42)). 

From then on Andrew faded into the background. Andrew's brother became more well\-known. Whenever the relationship between the two is mentioned, Andrew is always described as the brother of Simon Peter. It is never the other way around ([Matthew 4:18](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18); [Mark 1:16](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16); [John 1:40](https://ref.ly/John1:40); [6:8](https://ref.ly/John6:8)). Andrew is also mentioned without reference to his relationship to Peter ([Mark 1:29](https://ref.ly/Mark1:29); [3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18); [13:3](https://ref.ly/Mark13:3); [John 12:22](https://ref.ly/John12:22)). 

Andrew’s father was John ([Matthew 16:17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17); [John 1:42](https://ref.ly/John1:42); [21:15–17](https://ref.ly/John21:15-John21:17)). His hometown was Bethsaida ([John 1:44](https://ref.ly/John1:44)). Bethsaida is a village on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee.

The Gospel of John mentions disciples being with Jesus ([2:2](https://ref.ly/John2:2); [4:2](https://ref.ly/John4:2)). Andrew likely was one of that early group. However, he returned to his activity as a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee. Andrew shared a house with Peter and his family in Capernaum ([Matthew 4:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt4:18-Matt4:20); [Mark 1:16–18, 29–33](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:18,Mark1:29-Mark1:33)). While they were fishing, Andrew and Peter received a definite call to follow Jesus and become those who fish for people. From among the disciples of Jesus, a group of 12 were later specially chosen as apostles. Andrew is always listed among the first four named, along with Peter and two other brothers, John and James ([Matthew 10:2–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2-Matt10:4); [Luke 6:13–16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:13-Luke6:16); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)).

Andrew's Role Among the Twelve Apostles
---------------------------------------

Andrew is named in only three other contexts in the Gospels. At the feeding of the 5,000, he called attention to the boy who had five barley loaves and two fish ([John 6:8–9](https://ref.ly/John6:8-John6:9)). When certain Greeks came to Philip, asking to see Jesus, Philip told Andrew and then the two of them told Jesus ([John 12:20–22](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:22)). Finally, Andrew is listed among those who were questioning Jesus privately on the Mount of Olives ([Mark 13:3–4](https://ref.ly/Mark13:3-Mark13:4)). The last New Testament mention of Andrew is in the list of apostles waiting in the upper room in Jerusalem. The disciples were waiting for the promised outpouring (or coming) of the Holy Spirit ([Acts 1:12–14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:14)).

Later Traditions About Andrew
-----------------------------

Various writings associated with Andrew, such as the Acts of Andrew mentioned by the early church historian Eusebius, are of doubtful value. Some traditions indicate that Andrew ministered in Scythia. According to the Muratorian Canon, Andrew received a revelation at night that the apostle John should write the fourth Gospel. Tradition is rather uniform that Andrew died at Patrae in Achaia. 

A story developed that he was martyred (killed for his faith) on an X\-shaped cross. This X\-shaped cross is known as a “decussate” or “saltire” cross. It has become known as Saint Andrew’s Cross. Another tradition is that an arm of the dead Andrew was taken into Scotland as a relic by Regulus. Andrew became known as a patron saint of Scotland. A patron saint is a saint who is looked to for protection. On the calendar of saints of the Roman and Greek churches, Andrew’s date is set as November 30\. *See* Apocrypha (Specific Titles of Apocryphal Writings): Andrew, Acts of; Andrew, Story of; Andrew and Matthias, Acts of; Andrew and Paul, Acts of.
