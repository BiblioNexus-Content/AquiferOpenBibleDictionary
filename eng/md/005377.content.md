## Strong Drink (id: 8637)

STRONG DRINK
============

A strong drink is any kind of alcoholic drink.

It was forbidden to: 

* Levites who were entering the tent of meeting ([Leviticus 10:9](https://ref.ly/Lev10:9))
* Those taking the Nazirite vow ([Numbers 6:3](https://ref.ly/Num6:3); [Judges 13:4](https://ref.ly/Judg13:4-Judg13:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg13:4-Judg13:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Judg13:4-Judg13:14))
* Kings and rulers ([Proverbs 31:4](https://ref.ly/Prov31:4))
* John the Baptist ([Luke 1:15](https://ref.ly/Luke1:15))

The writer of [Proverbs 20:1](https://ref.ly/Prov20:1) suggests that the wise man does not become drunk by it. Isaiah warns against those who are addicted to it ([Isaiah 5:11, 22](https://ref.ly/Isa5:11,Isa5:22)). Strong drink was used as an offering in the Levitical sacrifice ([Numbers 28:7](https://ref.ly/Num28:7)). It was allowed during the feast when tithing ([Deuteronomy 14:26](https://ref.ly/Deut14:26)).
