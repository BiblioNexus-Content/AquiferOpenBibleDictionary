## Javan (Place) (id: 6242)

JAVAN (Place)
=============

A location commonly identified with Greece. The name Javan is linguistically associated with Ionia, a region in westernmost Asia Minor that was colonized by Greeks. Over time, people started using the name Javan to mean all of Greece. In many places in the Greek translation of the Bible, Javan appears as “Hellas,” which is another name for Greece.

Some hints as to its location are given as early as the “table of nations,” where Javan appears as the fourth son of Japheth ([Genesis 10:2](https://ref.ly/Gen10:2); compare [1 Chronicles 1:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:5)). Moving west from Gomer, this tends to place it in Europe. Japheth is also said to be the father of: 

* Elishah
* Tarshish
* Kittim
* Dodanim or Rodanim ([Genesis 10:4](https://ref.ly/Gen10:4); [1 Chronicles 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:7))

The connections of these areas or peoples is well known.

Most of the references to Ionia (Greece) are in the prophetic books. [Isaiah 66:19](https://ref.ly/Isa66:19) lists Javan with Tarshish, Put, Lud, and Tubal. The Lord's glory will be declared in those places. These are taken as a representative of the distant nations.

In a long prophecy against Tyre, Ezekiel names Javan, Tubal, and Meshech. They traded slaves and bronze vessels for Tyre's goods ([Ezekiel 27:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:13)). [Joel 3:6](https://ref.ly/Joel3:6) condemns Tyre for selling the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks.

[Ezekiel 27:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:19) in Hebrew text reads “Vedan and Javan from Uzal.” Certain translations handle this differently:

* “Greeks from Uzal”
* “Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal” (New American Standard Bible)
* “Dan also and Javan” (King James Version)
* “wine from Uzal" (Revised Standard Version)

The references to Javan in Daniel clearly mean Greece. The he\-goat who represents the king of Greece ([Daniel 8:21](https://ref.ly/Dan8:21)) is Alexander the Great. His empire was divided among his four generals upon his death. The prince of Greece in [Daniel 10:20](https://ref.ly/Dan10:20) is compared to the prince of Persia in [Daniel 10:13, 20](https://ref.ly/Dan10:13,Dan10:20). It has been suggested that "prince" means guardian angel. But, the prince of Persia's opposition to the archangel Michael shows that "prince" is a high\-ranking demonic spirit. (compare [Ephesians 6:12](https://ref.ly/Eph6:12)). [Daniel 11:2](https://ref.ly/Dan11:2) predicts a conflict between Persia and Greece. The next verse tells of Alexander the Great's success and his empire's breakup.
