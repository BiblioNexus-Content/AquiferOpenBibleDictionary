## Baca, Valley of (id: 3959)

BACA, Valley of
===============

A phrase in [Psalm 84:6](https://ref.ly/Ps84:6) often translated as “valley of weeping” comes from the Hebrew word *baca*, which refers to a type of tree mentioned in [2 Samuel 5:23–24](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:23-2Sam5:24) and [1 Chronicles 14:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:14-1Chr14:15). In these passages, it is translated as mulberry, aspen, or balsam. It is uncertain whether the valley of Baca in [Psalm 84](https://ref.ly/Ps84:1-Ps84:12) was an actual geographical location or a symbolic expression for times of grief or difficulty in life.

Some scholars believe it was a specific location near Jerusalem, possibly near the valley of Rephaim. It may symbolize a period or place of sorrow and hardship: 

1. The balsam trees in the valley might have exuded resinous gum, which looked like tears.
2. The journey through the valley could have been challenging.
3. The valley might have been characterized by rocks from which water seeped, similar to tears.
