## Arpad (id: 3762)

ARPAD
=====

A city in northern Syria. Arpad was overrun twice by the Assyrians: 

* In 740 BC by Tiglath\-pileser III
* In 720 BC by Sargon II

The Assyrians used Arpad and Hamath as examples of the inability of any gods, including Israel’s, to protect cities against Assyria’s attacks ([2 Kings 18:34](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:34); [19:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:13); [Isaiah 10:9](https://ref.ly/Isa10:9); [36:19](https://ref.ly/Isa36:19); [37:13](https://ref.ly/Isa37:13)). Arpad and Hamath are also mentioned in a later prophecy against the Syrian city of Damascus ([Jeremiah 49:23](https://ref.ly/Jer49:23)). 

Arpad has been identified as modern Tell Erfad, north of Aleppo.
