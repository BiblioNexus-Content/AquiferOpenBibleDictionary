## Chesil (id: 4514)

CHESIL
======

A city on the borders of Edom in the Negev. It was given to the tribe of Judah ([Joshua 15:30](https://ref.ly/Josh15:30)). In another lists of towns, Chesil is replaced by: 

1. Bethul ([Joshua 19:4](https://ref.ly/Josh19:4))
2. Bethuel ([1 Chronicles 4:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:30))
3. Perhaps Bethel, though not the Bethel north of Jerusalem ([1 Samel 30:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:27))

Bethuel or Bethul is considered by many scholars to be the original name, with Chesil as a later error.

*See also* Bethuel, Bethul (Place).
