## Assir (id: 3836)

ASSIR
=====

1. Korah’s son and a descendant of Levi through Kohath ([Exodus 6:24](https://ref.ly/Exod6:24); [1 Chronicles 6:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:22)).
2. Ebiasaph’s son and a descendant of the previous Assir ([1 Chronicles 6:23, 37](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:23,1Chr6:37)).
3. The son of Jeconiah (also called Jehoiachin), king of Judah ([1 Chronicles 3:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:17)). The Hebrew word *assir* might be an adjective describing Jeconiah. This would mean “while captive” (compare [2 Kings 24:15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:15)). If so, his children were born while he was a captive.
