2. The third of Jesse's eight sons and the brother of King David ([1 Samuel 16:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:9); [17:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:13)). Shammah was the father of Jonathan and Jonadab ([2 Samuel 21:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:20-2Sam21:21); [13:3ff](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:3-2Sam13:39).). The Bible also calls him by other names, including Shimea ([1 Chronicles 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13); [20:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:7)), Shimeah ([2 Samuel 13:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:3)), and Shimei ([21:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:21)).
3. The son of Agee the Hararite. He was one of David’s greatest warriors. He became famous for standing alone against the Philistines at a place called Lehi ([2 Samuel 23:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:11-2Sam23:12)).
