BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
====================

A *bride* is a woman who is getting married or has just been married. A *bridegroom* is the man she is marrying.

The Bible sometimes uses these words to describe the close relationship between Christ and the church ([Ephesians 5:25–27](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:27)).
