## Humility (id: 5940)

HUMILITY
========

Humility is a state of being lowly or having little power and influence. It often means experiencing difficult situations that make other people think someone is less important. While many people may see humility as weakness, both Jewish and Christian traditions teach that humility is the right way to relate to God. Humility means being thankful and knowing that life is a gift. It shows itself as an honest recognition that we depend completely on God.

Humility in the Old Testament
-----------------------------

The Bible does not distinguish clearly between humility and being gentle or patient. In Israel’s early history, humble people were the poor, the suffering, and those without power. God helps the humble but brings down the proud ([1 Samuel 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:7); [2 Samuel 22:28](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:28)). When Abraham experienced God's power and glory, Abraham said humbly he was just "dust and ashes" ([Genesis 18:27](https://ref.ly/Gen18:27)). 

Israel started as a nation of slaves. They knew God chose them not because they were big or rich but because of God's love ([Deuteronomy 7:7–8](https://ref.ly/Deut7:7-Deut7:8)). By saying all wealth and power came from God, two main sources of human pride are controlled ([Jeremiah 9:23–24](https://ref.ly/Jer9:23-Jer9:24)).

God always cares for humble poor people ([Exodus 23:6, 11](https://ref.ly/Exod23:6,Exod23:11); [Deuteronomy 15:4, 7](https://ref.ly/Deut15:4,Deut15:7)). Over time, the humility of the poor became a symbol of someone who truly followed God ([Numbers 12:3](https://ref.ly/Num12:3)). The Old Testament links humility with doing what is right. God requires His people to be humble, just, and merciful ([Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8)). In the Psalms particularly, “the afflicted” is almost a technical term for the righteous ([Psalms 22:26](https://ref.ly/Ps22:26); [25:9](https://ref.ly/Ps25:9); [147:6](https://ref.ly/Ps147:6)).

Also, humility is how sinners should act when faced with God's holiness. When the prophet Isaiah saw God's glory in the temple, he said, “I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips” ([Isaiah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5)). So humility became more about character than just being poor or suffering. It became a key part of being religious and good, expected of all people who follow God.

Humility in the New Testament
-----------------------------

In the New Testament, humility rarely means just being poor, suffering, or without power. The idea of humility is linked to Jesus as the Messiah (God's chosen one). The Old Testament said the coming king would be humble, and this described Jesus perfectly ([Zechariah 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9); [Matthew 21:4–5](https://ref.ly/Matt21:4-Matt21:5)). As God's Son, Jesus did not think about himself but lived a life of obeying and trusting God the Father. The apostle Paul said that Jesus, as God's Son, "emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness” ([Philippians 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:8)). Jesus never showed pride or tried to make himself seem important.

Jesus spoke strongly against false religion, but he was “gentle and humble in heart” ([Matthew 11:29](https://ref.ly/Matt11:29)). He warned against seeking status and criticized religious leaders who hurt poor and weak people ([Luke 14:11](https://ref.ly/Luke14:11); [Matthew 23:12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:12)). At the same time, he was humble before those he came to serve and help ([Luke 22:27](https://ref.ly/Luke22:27); [Mark 10:45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:45); [Matthew 20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28)). 

Jesus's highest honor was his willingness to accept death on the cross in obedience to God the Father’s will. So, his teaching about being poor in spirit matched his own life. He gave all glory to his Father and lived completely depending on him ([John 5:19](https://ref.ly/John5:19); [6:38](https://ref.ly/John6:38); [7:15](https://ref.ly/John7:15); [8:28, 50](https://ref.ly/John8:28,John8:50); [14:10, 24](https://ref.ly/John14:10,John14:24)). By washing his disciples’ feet, he acted as a servant without losing his dignity or self\-worth. He set this service as an example of a life that finds happiness in putting others first ([John 13:1–20](https://ref.ly/John13:1-John13:20); [Philippians 2:1–4](https://ref.ly/Phil2:1-Phil2:4)).

So, followers of Jesus are called to live humbly. Instead of seeking status, safety, or success, Christians should look for ways to serve others. Humility becomes the guiding principle for showing love which fulfills God's law (compare [Romans 12:10](https://ref.ly/Rom12:10); [13:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10)).
