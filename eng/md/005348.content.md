## Spirituality (id: 8609)

SPIRITUALITY
============

Spirituality is the quality of living according to the Holy Spirit’s guidance and power. Spirituality is the visible result of sanctification, which is the process by which God makes a person holy (set apart for him). As sanctification grows, spirituality becomes stronger.
