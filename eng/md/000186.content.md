## Ahikam (id: 3445)

AHIKAM
======

Shaphan’s son, an officer of the court of King Josiah of Judah ([2 Kings 22:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:12)). 

Ahikam was one of the people who were sent to the prophetess Huldah to ask about the Book of the Law ([2 Kings 22:14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:14-2Kgs22:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:14-2Kgs22:20)). Later, under King Jehoiakim, Ahikam saved the prophet Jeremiah from being killed ([Jeremiah 26:24](https://ref.ly/Jer26:24)). Ahikam’s son Gedaliah became the governor of Judah after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and took most of its citizens to Babylon in 586 BC ([2 Kings 25:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:22); [Jeremiah 39:14](https://ref.ly/Jer39:14); [40:5](https://ref.ly/Jer40:5-Jer40:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Jer40:5-Jer40:16); [41:1](https://ref.ly/Jer41:1-Jer41:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/Jer41:1-Jer41:18); [43:6](https://ref.ly/Jer43:6)).
