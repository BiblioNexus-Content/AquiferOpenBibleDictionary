## Beth-Shemesh (id: 4203)

BETH\-SHEMESH
=============

1. A Canaanite city on the northern border of Judah’s territory ([Joshua 15:10](https://ref.ly/Josh15:10)) and the southern border of Dan’s southern portion. Beth\-shemesh means “the house of Shamash,” the Canaanite sun god. It was included in the list of cities of Dan as *Ir\-shemesh* ([Joshua 19:41](https://ref.ly/Josh19:41)). Beth\-shemesh was one of the towns of Judah gave to the Levites ([Joshua 21:16](https://ref.ly/Josh21:16); [1 Chronicles 6:59](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:59)). Its inhabitants were called Beth\-shemites ([1 Samuel 6:14, 18](https://ref.ly/1Sam6:14,1Sam6:18)). When the Philistines decided to getrid of the captured ark of the covenant because of the plagues in their cities, they took it to Beth\-shemesh. The area was also the scene of a great victory of King Joash (Jehoash) of Israel over King Amaziah of Judah ([2 Chronicles 25:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23)[23](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:21-2Chr25:23)). About a century later, Beth\-shemesh was captured from King Ahaz of Judah by the Philistines ([2 Chronicles 28:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20)[20](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:16-2Chr28:20)). After that, the settlement fell into decline and was finally destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC.
2. A Canaanite city given to the tribe of Issachar ([Joshua 19:22](https://ref.ly/Josh19:22)).
3. A strong Canaanite city given to the tribe of Naphtali ([Joshua 19:38](https://ref.ly/Josh19:38)). The people who lived in this Beth\-shemesh were not kicked out by the Israelites ([Judges 1:33](https://ref.ly/Judg1:33)).
4. The term used in the King James Version to describe the Egyptian city of Heliopolis (or On), where the sun was worshiped ([Jeremiah 43:13](https://ref.ly/Jer43:13)).
