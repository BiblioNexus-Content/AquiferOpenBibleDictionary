## Gozan (id: 5522)

GOZAN
=====

City and district near the Euphrates River. The Habor River (modern Khabur) flowed through it. The Assyrians conquered it sometime before Sennacherib’s invasion of Judah (701 BC). This fact is mentioned by Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in a blasphemous letter sent to Hezekiah, king of Judah ([2 Kgs 19:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:12); [Is 37:12](https://ref.ly/Isa37:12)). Later it became one of the places in Assyria where conquered Israelites were deported.
