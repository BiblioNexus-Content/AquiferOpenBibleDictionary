## Beth-Zur (id: 4214)

BETH\-ZUR
=========

A hill town of Judah in the mountains north of Hebron ([Joshua 15:58](https://ref.ly/Josh15:58)). Beth\-zur was built by Maon, one of Caleb’s descendants ([1 Chronicles 2:45](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:45)), and was a natural stronghold of Judah. It was defended by King Rehoboam of the southern kingdom in the 10th century BC, even though it was already less important ([2 Chronicles 11:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:7)). It was a political center during the time of Nehemiah ([Nehemiah 3:16](https://ref.ly/Neh3:16)). In the Maccabean period it was known by the Greek name Bethsura. Judas Maccabeus defeated Syrian general Lysias there ([1 Maccabees 4:29, 61](https://ref.ly/1Macc4:29,1Macc4:61)) and lost the town a few years later. After recapturing Beth\-zur from the Syrians, Simon Maccabeus strengthened it in 140 BC, making it one of the most important fortresses on the border between Judah and Idumea ([1 Maccabees 11:65](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66)[–](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66)[66](https://ref.ly/1Macc11:65-1Macc11:66); [14:33](https://ref.ly/1Macc14:33)).
