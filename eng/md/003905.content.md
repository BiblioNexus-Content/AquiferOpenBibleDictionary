## Mishnah (id: 7165)

MISHNAH
=======

A collection of interpretations of the law. According to rabbinic tradition, these interpretations were given to Moses when he received the law from God on Mount Sinai. They were passed down orally for generations.

This "oral tradition" is the "law" that Jesus referred to in [Matthew 15:1](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/Matt15:1-Matt15:9). By around AD 200, Rabbi Judah completed the work that Rabbi Akiba began around AD 120\. This oral tradition was then written down and called the Mishnah. The word "Mishnah" comes from a verb that reflects the way the material was repeated orally from teacher to disciple for many generations.

The Mishnah is divided into six "orders." Each order is divided into sections called "tractates," which are further divided into chapters. The six orders cover specific legal areas:

1. **Seeds**: Agricultural laws, starting with a tractate on daily prayers.
2. **Festivals**: Feasts, fast days, and Sabbath regulations.
3. **Women**: Marriage and family laws.
4. **Injuries**: Civil and criminal law, along with ethical standards.
5. **Holy Things**: Ritual laws and priesthood activities.
6. **Purifications**: Laws of ritual purity.

The Mishnah serves as a commentary on Old Testament law. It forms the basis for the Gemara and the Talmud, which are further commentaries and discussions on the Mishnah and the law.
