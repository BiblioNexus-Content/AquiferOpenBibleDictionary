## Hamor (id: 5629)

HAMOR
=====

A Hivite or Horite prince who ruled the area around Shechem ([Genesis 34:2](https://ref.ly/Gen34:2)). When Jacob returned from Paddan\-aram with his family, he bought land from Hamor. During this time, Hamor's son Shechem forced Dinah, Jacob's daughter, to have sexual intercourse with him even though she did not want to.

At his son's request, Hamor asked Jacob to marry Shechem and Dinah. He offered a dowry. Simeon and Levi, pretending to be friends, tricked the males living in that city into getting circumcised. Then, they attacked and killed them before they healed, seeking revenge for their sister's humiliation.

“Hamor” is the Hebrew word that Jacob uses to denote Issachar in blessing his sons ([Genesis 49:14](https://ref.ly/Gen49:14)). It is the usual word for “ass” in the Old Testament (for example, [Genesis 42:26](https://ref.ly/Gen42:26); [Exodus 20:17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:17); [Judges 15:15](https://ref.ly/Judg15:15); [Isaiah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Isa1:3); [Zechariah 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9)).
