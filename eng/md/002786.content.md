## Interpreter (id: 6038)

INTERPRETER
===========

A person who helps communicate between speakers of different languages. Or, one who explains dreams. 

Joseph pretended to need an interpreter to speak to his brothers ([Genesis 42:23](https://ref.ly/Gen42:23)). Also, dreams needed to be interpreted ([Genesis 40:8](https://ref.ly/Gen40:8); [41:15](https://ref.ly/Gen41:15-Gen41:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen41:15-Gen41:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Gen41:15-Gen41:16); [Daniel 2](https://ref.ly/Dan2:1-Dan2:49); [4:6](https://ref.ly/Dan4:6-Dan4:9,Dan4:18-Dan4:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan4:6-Dan4:9)[9, 18](https://ref.ly/Dan4:6-Dan4:9,Dan4:18-Dan4:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan4:6-Dan4:9)[24](https://ref.ly/Dan4:6-Dan4:9,Dan4:18-Dan4:24); [5:7](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:8,Dan5:12-Dan5:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:8)[8, 12](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:8,Dan5:12-Dan5:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:8)[17](https://ref.ly/Dan5:7-Dan5:8,Dan5:12-Dan5:17); [7:16](https://ref.ly/Dan7:16)). The interpreter was sometimes one who acted as a mediator ([Job 33:23](https://ref.ly/Job33:23)). 

Ezra and Nehemiah acted as interpreters or translators of the law of Moses when it was read to the Jews who had returned from exile ([Nehemiah 8:8](https://ref.ly/Neh8:8-Neh8:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Neh8:8-Neh8:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Neh8:8-Neh8:9)). They must not have known Hebrew. 

In New Testament times, the interpreter: 

* Explained the words of those who spoke in tongues ([1 Corinthians 14:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:28))
* Translated foreign languages ([Acts 2:6](https://ref.ly/Acts2:6))
* Explained the Scriptures ([Luke 24:27](https://ref.ly/Luke24:27))
