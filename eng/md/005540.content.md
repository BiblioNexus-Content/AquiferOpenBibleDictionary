## Thaddaeus, the Apostle (id: 8801)

THADDAEUS, The Apostle
======================

Thaddaeus was one of the 12 original apostles according to the lists in [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18) and [Matthew 10:3\.](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3) The King James Version identifies him as "Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus." It is quite likely that Thaddaeus is the same person as Judas son of James (not Iscariot) in [Luke 6:16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:16) and [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13).
