## Harmon (id: 5674)

HARMON\*
========

Place mentioned by the prophet Amos to which the inhabitants of Bashan would be exiled ([Am 4:3](https://ref.ly/Amos4:3), nlt mg). Harmon occurs only once in the Bible, and there is no known place with such a name. There are problems with the text and numerous emendations have been proposed. Some Hebrew manuscripts render it as a common noun, meaning “palace” (kjv), rather than a proper name. The Septuagint renders it “the mountain of Rimmon,” perhaps referring to a hill east of Rimmon (see [Jgs 20:45–47](https://ref.ly/Judg20:45-Judg20:47); cf. [Jos 15:32](https://ref.ly/Josh15:32); [19:13](https://ref.ly/Josh19:13)).
