## Jonath-Elem-Rechokim (id: 6433)

JONATH\-ELEM\-RECHOKIM\*
========================

Hebrew phrase in the title of [Psalm 56](https://ref.ly/Ps56:1-Ps56:13) (kjv), translated “To be sung to the tune, ‘Dove on Distant Oaks’ ” (nlt); perhaps a familiar ancient melody to which the psalm was performed.
