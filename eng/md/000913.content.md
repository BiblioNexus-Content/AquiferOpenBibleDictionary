## Beth-Leaphrah (id: 4184)

BETH\-LEAPHRAH
==============

A town mentioned by the prophet Micah. Since Beth\-leaphrah (“house of Aphrah” in the King James Version) means “house of dust,” Micah made a sarcastic pun by telling its people to “roll in the dust” ([Micah 1:10](https://ref.ly/Mic1:10)).

* **Associated Passages:** MIC 1:10
