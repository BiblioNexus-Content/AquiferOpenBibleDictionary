## Law of Moses (id: 7212)

LAW OF MOSES
============

The Law of Moses refers to the religious, moral, and social rules that God gave to the Israelite people through Moses. These laws can be found in several books of the Old Testament: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

The Law of Moses covered many aspects of life for the ancient Israelites. It included:

1. The Ten Commandments, a list of ten instructions for living and worshiping God ([Exodus 20:1–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod20:17)).
2. Instructions about religious ceremonies and sacrifices, including how to worship God and seek forgiveness for sins ([Leviticus 1–7](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev7:38)).
3. Rules for daily life, including guidelines about food, cleanliness, relationships, and business dealings ([Leviticus 11–15](https://ref.ly/Lev11:1-Lev15:33); [19](https://ref.ly/Lev19:1-Lev19:37)).
4. Moral guidelines about how to treat others and live honestly ([Leviticus 19](https://ref.ly/Lev19:1-Lev19:37)).
5. Laws for community leaders, including instructions for priests, judges, and other leaders ([Deuteronomy 16–18](https://ref.ly/Deut16:1-Deut18:22)).

The Law helped the Israelites understand how to live as God's people. It showed them what was right and wrong, and how to make things right when they failed. Jesus later said he came not to end the Law but to fulfill it ([Matthew 5:17](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17)).
