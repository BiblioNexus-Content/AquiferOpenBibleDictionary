ASH
===

Ash trees (genus *Fraxinus*) grow in many parts of the world, including some regions of the Middle East. The flowering or manna ash (*Fraxinus ornus*) is one such tree. It grows from 4\.6 to 15\.2 meters (15 to 50 feet) tall and produces a sweet sap known as "manna."

Some Bible scholars believe that the "ash" tree mentioned in [Isaiah 44:14](https://ref.ly/Isa44:14) in the King James Version refers to the Aleppo pine. Although not true ash trees, some other desert plants like the prickly alhagi (*Alhagi maurorum*) and the manna tamarisk (*Tamarix mannifera*) produce sweet substances that may have been associated with biblical "manna."
