## Blastus (id: 4269)

BLASTUS
=======

A royal secretary to King Herod Agrippa I ([Acts 12:20](https://ref.ly/Acts12:20)). The people from the cities of Tyre and Sidon needed food from Herod's country, but Herod was angry with them. They first made friends with Blastus so he would help them get a meeting with the king. After Blastus arranged this meeting, Herod gave a speech to the delegates. During this speech, Herod accepted worship from the people instead of giving glory to God. Because of this, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a deadly illness (verses [21–23](https://ref.ly/Acts12:21-Acts12:23)).
