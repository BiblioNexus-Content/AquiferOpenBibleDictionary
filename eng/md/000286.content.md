## Amaziah (id: 3547)

AMAZIAH
=======

1. The ninth king of Judah, who ruled from 796 to 767 BC. At age 25, he became king after his father, King Joash. Amaziah’s mother was Jehoaddin. Assassins killed Joash after he was king for 40 years ([2 Kings 12:19–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:19-2Kgs12:21)). Amaziah ruled Judah for 29 years before assassins also killed him ([14:18–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:18-2Kgs14:20)). When Amaziah began his reign, another Joash was ruling the northern kingdom of Israel ([14:1–2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:1-2Kgs14:2)).

    Amaziah was not like his ancestor David ([2 Kings 14:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:3)). Like his father, Amaziah did things that pleased God but failed to remove the pagan shrines that were corrupting the nation’s religious life. He respected the law of Moses, at least at the beginning ([14:4–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:4-2Kgs14:6)).

    Amaziah did not act wisely toward the rival kingdom of Israel. He went to war against the Edomites. He hired 100,000 soldiers from Israel. But he was warned by a prophet not to use them in battle, so Amaziah sent them home.

    On their way out of Judah, the angry soldiers raided cities. They killed 3,000 people. Amaziah’s troops were victorious against the Edomites. At the Valley of Salt, they killed 10,000 of the enemy in battle. They killed another 10,000 prisoners ([2 Chronicles 25:5–13](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:5-2Chr25:13)).

    Foolishly, Amaziah brought Edomite idols or false gods back with him after his conquest. He worshiped them. The Lord sent a prophet to tell Amaziah he would be destroyed for worshiping the idols ([2 Chronicles 25:14–16](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:14-2Chr25:16)). Proud of his conquest of Edom, Amaziah soon declared war on King Joash of Israel. Joash warned him in a parable that Judah would be crushed like a flower. Amaziah refused to back down. The two armies met at Beth\-shemesh in Judah. Amaziah’s army was defeated. The Israelites captured Jerusalem and robbed the temple and palace.

    Amaziah was taken prisoner but was evidently left in Jerusalem. He outlived Joash of Israel by 15 years ([2 Chronicles 25:17–26](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:17-2Chr25:26)). Amaziah was murdered in Lachish. He had fled there when he heard about a plot against him in Jerusalem. His body was brought back to the capital city and buried in the royal cemetery ([2 Chronicles 25:27–28](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:27-2Chr25:28)).

2. The father of Joshah. He was a member of Simeon’s tribe ([1 Chronicles 4:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:34)).
3. Hilkiah’s son. He was a Levite of Merari’s clan ([1 Chronicles 6:45](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:45)).
4. A priest of Bethel in the days of Jeroboam II. He was an opponent of the prophet Amos ([Amos 7:10–17](https://ref.ly/Amos7:10-Amos7:17)).
