HANDMAID, HANDMAIDEN\*
======================

Female servants. They were familiar members among many households in biblical days. The handmaid cared for the women and children of a family and served as the woman’s personal attendant. She enjoyed the protection of the law ([Lv 25:6](https://ref.ly/Lev25:6); [Dt 5:14](https://ref.ly/Deut5:14); [15:12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut15:12-Deut15:15)), and as a free wife’s maid, sometimes became a concubine where there was a childless marriage ([Gn 30:3](https://ref.ly/Gen30:3)).
