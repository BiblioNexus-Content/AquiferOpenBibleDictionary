## Scepter (id: 8165)

SCEPTER
=======

A scepter is a special staff that kings and rulers used to show their power. It was typically a long stick with decorative designs at the top. Kings would hold these scepters during important ceremonies to show they were in charge. Sometimes, a shorter version of the scepter was used as a weapon in battle, which also symbolized a ruler's military strength.

In the Bible, the scepter appears in many stories as a symbol of royal authority and military power. 

Examples of the scepter as a symbol of royal authority include:

* When Jacob blessed his sons, he said Judah’s descendants would have royal authority ([Genesis 49:10](https://ref.ly/Gen49:10); see also [Psalm 45:6](https://ref.ly/Ps45:6) and [Hebrews 1:8](https://ref.ly/Heb1:8)).
* The prophet Amos refers to the royal authority of the kings of Syria and Philistia ([Amos 1:5, 8](https://ref.ly/Amos1:5,Amos1:8)).
* The prophet Zechariah refers to the royal authority of Egypt ([Zechariah 10:11](https://ref.ly/Zech10:11)).
* King Ahasuerus (also called Xerxes) held out a scepter (a symbol of his royal authority) to Esther ([Esther 4:11](https://ref.ly/Esth4:11); [5:2](https://ref.ly/Esth5:2); [8:4](https://ref.ly/Esth8:4)).

Examples of the scepter as a symbol of military power include:

* The book of Numbers talks about a scepter that would belong to God's chosen king (the Messiah) who was promised to come in the future ([Numbers 24:17](https://ref.ly/Num24:17)).
* The prophet Isaiah talks about how God would break Babylon's scepter ([Isaiah 14:5](https://ref.ly/Isa14:5)). God would destroy the power that Babylon used to control and harm other nations.
* The prophet Ezekiel used the image of a scepter to explain how Israel had lost its power and could not get it back ([Ezekiel 19:11, 14](https://ref.ly/Ezek19:11,Ezek19:14)).
