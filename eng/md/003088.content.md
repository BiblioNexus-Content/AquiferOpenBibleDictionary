## Jeshua (Place) (id: 6345)

JESHUA (Place)
==============

Town in the Negev listed before Moladah among the towns where Judeans returned after exile ([Neh 11:26](https://ref.ly/Neh11:26); cf. v [20](https://ref.ly/Neh11:20)). It may be identical with the Shema mentioned next to Moladah in [Joshua 15:26](https://ref.ly/Josh15:26). The name is perhaps preserved in Tell es\-Sa’weh, northeast of Beersheba.
