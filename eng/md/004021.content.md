## Nadab (id: 7277)

NADAB
=====

1. The oldest son of Aaron and Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23); [Numbers 3:2](https://ref.ly/Num3:2); [1 Chronicles 24:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:1)). Nadab became one of Israel’s first priests together with his brothers and father. He participated in the signing of the covenant with God on Mount Sinai ([Exodus 24:1, 9](https://ref.ly/Exod24:1,Exod24:9)). God chosen him to serve as a priest ([28:1](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1)).

    Nadab and his brother Abihu, Aaron’s second son, died because they offered “strange fire” to the Lord ([Leviticus 10:1–2](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:2); [Numbers 3:4](https://ref.ly/Num3:4); [1 Chronicles 24:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:2)). Incense offered in the morning usually came before the cutting up of the sacrifice. In this case “fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them.” The offering of “strange fire” does not appear anywhere else in the Bible.

    Jewish teachers have suggested different explanations for what Nadab and Abihu did wrong. An warning against drinking wine in the tent of meeting follows this event ([Leviticus 10:9](https://ref.ly/Lev10:9)). So, an early tradition held that the brothers were drunk. Any priest who drank alcohol in this holy tent would be punished by death.

    An important detail appears in the instructions Moses gave to Aaron, the grieving father of Nadab and Abihu. Moses told Aaron not to mourn or stop his duties as priest. Because Aaron had been set apart by the holy anointing oil, he had to continue serving God. He was not allowed to leave the tent "lest he die." Instead, the rest of Israel mourned for Nadab and Abihu ([Leviticus 10:3–7](https://ref.ly/Lev10:3-Lev10:7)).

2. The son of Jeroboam, who became king of Israel after his father. Nadab ruled for two years, from 909 to 908 BC ([1 Kings 14:20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:20); [15:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:25)). He became king during the second year of King Asa's reign in Judah and was replaced in the third year of Asa's reign ([1 Kings 15:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:28)). Jeroboam may have arranged for Nadab to take power before his death, since Nadab likely understood the dangers that continued among the northern tribes. However, Nadab failed to make the kingdom stable.

    To gain the support of the army, he went to battle against the Philistines at Gibbethon, about 4 kilometers (2\.5 miles) southwest of Gezer. Baasha from the tribe of Issachar, probably a military officer, killed Nadab and all his sons and took the throne. This fulfilled the prophecy that Ahijah the Shilonite had spoken against the family of Jeroboam ([1 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:29)).

3. A Jerahmeelite, the son of Shammai and grandson of Onam, and the great\-grandson of Jerahmeel. Nadab had two sons, Seled and Appaim ([1 Chronicles 2:26–30](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:26-1Chr2:30)).
4. The son of Jeiel and Maacah, a Gibeonite ([1 Chronicles 8:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:30); [9:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:36)).
