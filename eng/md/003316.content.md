## Kibroth-Hattaavah (id: 6573)

KIBROTH\-HATTAAVAH
==================

Location in the wilderness where the Israelites who were killed by plague for craving meat from Egypt were buried ([Nm 11:34–35](https://ref.ly/Num11:34-Num11:35); [33:16–17](https://ref.ly/Num33:16-Num33:17); [Dt 9:22](https://ref.ly/Deut9:22)). It was situated between Mt Sinai and Hazeroth, but its exact site is unknown. The name, meaning “graves of craving,” accords with the account of the quails.
