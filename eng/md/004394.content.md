## People of the Land (id: 7653)

PEOPLE OF THE LAND
==================

The phrase "people of the land" comes from the Hebrew *‘Am\-Ha’arets.* In a generic sense, *'Am\-Ha'arets* referred to a political or ethnic group of people, like: 

* The Hittite sons of Heth ([Genesis 23:7](https://ref.ly/Gen23:7))
* The Egyptians ([Genesis 42:6](https://ref.ly/Gen42:6))
* The Israelites ([Exodus 5:5](https://ref.ly/Exod5:5))
* The nations of Canaan ([Numbers 13:28](https://ref.ly/Num13:28); [Nehemiah 9:24](https://ref.ly/Neh9:24))
* The Ammonites ([Numbers 21:34](https://ref.ly/Num21:34))

As Israel grew into a nation, the meaning changed. The term came to mean the common people who were not part of the religious or political leadership ([2 Kings 11:14–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:14-2Kgs11:20); [25:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:3); [2 Chronicles 33:25](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:25); [Jeremiah 52:25](https://ref.ly/Jer52:25)). After many Jews returned from exile in Babylon, the term took on a new meaning. It described Jews who had married people from other nations. Ezra and his followers usually avoided these mixed\-marriage families ([Ezra 4:4](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:4); [10:2, 11](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:2,Ezra10:11); [Nehemiah 10:28–31](https://ref.ly/Neh10:28-Neh10:31)). Later, rabbinic Judaism called Jews who could not follow the whole law *'Am\-Ha'arets*.
