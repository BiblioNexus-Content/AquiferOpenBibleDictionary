## Kanatha (id: 6519)

KANATHA
=======

One of the original ten Greek cities. Rome rebuilt it after Pompey’s conquest of Palestine and Syria around 63 BC. The region of these cities became known as the Decapolis. Kanatha (also spelled Canatha) was about 96\.5 kilometers (60 miles) east of the Sea of Galilee. It formed the easternmost boundary of the Decapolis. Some identify the city with Kenath of [Numbers 32:42](https://ref.ly/Num32:42). The modern town of Qanawat is a short distance northeast of es\-Suweideh in the Hauran region.
