## Kanah (id: 6518)

KANAH
=====

1\. Brook forming Ephraim’s northern border and the southern border of Manasseh’s tribe ([Jos 16:8](https://ref.ly/Josh16:8); [17:9](https://ref.ly/Josh17:9)). It flowed westward, joining the Yarkon River about five miles (8 kilometers) from the Mediterranean just north of the modern city of Tel Aviv (biblical Joppa). It is dry most of the year. Kanah is today called Wadi Qana.

2\. City situated along Asher’s border ([Jos 19:28](https://ref.ly/Josh19:28)). It lay about six miles (9\.7 kilometers) southeast of Tyre on one of the major northeast\-southwest routes through northern Galilee. Qana (in modern Lebanon) still bears the name and marks the site.
