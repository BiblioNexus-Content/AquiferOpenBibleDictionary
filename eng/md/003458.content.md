## Lehi (id: 6717)

LEHI
====

Place in Judah where the Philistines assembled to capture Samson ([Jgs 15:9](https://ref.ly/Judg15:9)). The place was evidently in the hills, and after Samson’s victory (using a jawbone of an ass for a weapon), it was called “the height of the jawbone” (“Jawbone Hill,” nlt), that is, Ramath\-lehi (v [17](https://ref.ly/Judg15:17)). It was apparently near a spring in a crater or depression (v [19](https://ref.ly/Judg15:19)). An adjacent cliff was called Etam (v [11](https://ref.ly/Judg15:11)). Other than somewhere in the hills behind Beth\-shemesh, there is no hint of where to locate (Ramath\-) Lehi.
