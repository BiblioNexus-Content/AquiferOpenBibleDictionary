## Achan, Achar (id: 3336)

ACHAN, ACHAR
============

A member of the tribe of Judah who kept some of the loot from the Israelite victory at Jericho, disobeying Joshua’s orders and God’s commands ([Joshua 6:1–7:1](https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh7:1)). 

Later, Israel was defeated at Ai, a weaker city than Jericho. This defeat showed Joshua that God was angry. With God’s help, Joshua discovered which Israelite had disobeyed. Achan confessed that he had buried a robe and some gold and silver from Jericho in his tent ([Joshua 7:20](https://ref.ly/Josh7:20-Josh7:22)–[22](https://ref.ly/Josh7:20-Josh7:22)). The stolen loot was found and taken to the valley of Achor (meaning “trouble”), where Achan and his family were killed. 

In the Hebrew text, [1 Chronicles 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:7) gives Achan’s name as Achar (meaning “disaster”) because he “brought trouble upon Israel by violating the ban on devoted things.”
