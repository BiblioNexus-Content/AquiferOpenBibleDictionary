## Zebedee (id: 9156)

ZEBEDEE
=======

The father of the disciples James and John ([Matthew 26:37](https://ref.ly/Matt26:37); [Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17); [10:35](https://ref.ly/Mark10:35)). Zebedee was a fisher and may have been wealthy since he had servants and connections with the high priest ([John 18:15](https://ref.ly/John18:15)). Although he personally appears only once in the narrative ([Matthew 4:21](https://ref.ly/Matt4:21); [Mark 1:19](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20)), his wife, Salome, appears often as one of the believers who followed Christ.
