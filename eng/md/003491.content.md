The illumination that makes sight possible.

Light in the Old Testament
--------------------------

Light is a concept with many meanings in the Old Testament. It often refers to ordinary, physical light, but it also symbolizes spiritual truth. The first thing God created was light ([Genesis 1:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3)). He also created the sun, moon, and stars to give light ([Genesis 1:16](https://ref.ly/Gen1:16)). Sometimes, the Bible personifies light. For example, Job describes it as if it lives in a place no one can reach ([Job 38:19](https://ref.ly/Job38:19); compare with verse [24](https://ref.ly/Job38:24)). The Israelites also used man\-made light in the tabernacle ([Exodus 25:37](https://ref.ly/Exod25:37)).

Light is a symbol of what is good, uplifting, or connected to important people—especially God. The preacher in Ecclesiastes says, “Light is sweet” ([Ecclesiastes 11:7](https://ref.ly/Eccl11:7)). During the plagues in Egypt, while the Egyptians were in total darkness, the Israelites had light ([Exodus 10:23](https://ref.ly/Exod10:23)). When the Israelites left Egypt, God led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night ([Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21)). The pillar of fire gave them light while their enemies were in darkness ([Exodus 14:20](https://ref.ly/Exod14:20)). Even when they sinned, Israel remembered that God did not abandon them. The pillar of fire remained to guide them ([Nehemiah 9:19](https://ref.ly/Neh9:19); compare [Nehemiah 9:12](https://ref.ly/Neh9:12); [Psalms 78:14](https://ref.ly/Ps78:14); [105:39](https://ref.ly/Ps105:39)).

In the Old Testament, light often represents God’s blessing. Job said, “He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light” ([Job 12:22](https://ref.ly/Job12:22)). When Job was in trouble, he remembered the times when God lit the way for him, and he felt safe ([Job 29:2–3](https://ref.ly/Job29:2-Job29:3)). Job’s friend Eliphaz also said that if Job followed his advice, "light will shine on your ways" ([Job 22:28](https://ref.ly/Job22:28)). The psalmist also saw it as a blessing when God lit his lamp ([Psalms 18:28](https://ref.ly/Ps18:28); [118:27](https://ref.ly/Ps118:27); compare [97:11](https://ref.ly/Ps97:11); [112:4](https://ref.ly/Ps112:4)).

Light is closely connected to God. The Bible even says that God is light: “The Lord will be your everlasting light” ([Isaiah 60:19–20](https://ref.ly/Isa60:19-Isa60:20)). The psalmist rejoiced, saying, “The LORD is my light and my salvation” ([Psalm 27:1](https://ref.ly/Ps27:1)). God is described as being clothed with light ([Psalm 104:2](https://ref.ly/Ps104:2)), and light lives with Him ([Daniel 2:22](https://ref.ly/Dan2:22)). For God, darkness and light are the same; neither can hide anything from Him ([Psalm 139:12](https://ref.ly/Ps139:12)). The prophet Micah also described God as light and as someone who brings His servants into the light ([Micah 7:8–9](https://ref.ly/Mic7:8-Mic7:9)), showing that God brings blessing and victory to His people.

God’s blessing is often described as the “light of His presence.” In [Psalm 4:6](https://ref.ly/Ps4:6), the psalmist says, “Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD." This expression of light refers to God's favor. In [Psalm 44:3](https://ref.ly/Ps44:3), it is God's light, His right hand, and His love that bring victory to His people. Those who walk in God's light are blessed ([Psalm 89:15](https://ref.ly/Ps89:15)), but this light also exposes hidden sins ([Psalm 90:8](https://ref.ly/Ps90:8)). No one can hide from God's watchful eye, but His light mainly represents the blessing that comes from His presence. On one occasion, Job used the phrase to describe favor from others ([Job 29:24](https://ref.ly/Job29:24)). The light God gives His servants allows them to share His blessing with others ([Isaiah 42:6](https://ref.ly/Isa42:6); [49:6](https://ref.ly/Isa49:6)).

God’s justice is also linked to light. He says, “My justice will become a light to the nation” ([Isaiah 51:4](https://ref.ly/Isa51:4)). In this context, God’s light is powerful, like a consuming fire. Light is also connected to good behavior, as seen in Proverbs: “The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn” ([Proverbs 4:18](https://ref.ly/Prov4:18)).

The absence of light is used as a symbol of disaster. Some people “grope in the darkness without light” ([Job 12:25](https://ref.ly/Job12:25)). Job’s friend Bildad believed that the light of the wicked would be put out as punishment ([Job 18:5–17](https://ref.ly/Job18:5-Job18:17)). After the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon, the people mourned, saying, “He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light” ([Lamentations 3:2](https://ref.ly/Lam3:2)).

Light in the New Testament
--------------------------

In the New Testament, references to light are often symbolic. For example, when Saul of Tarsus encountered “a light from heaven” on the road to Damascus ([Acts 9:3](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3); compare [22:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:11); [26:13](https://ref.ly/Acts26:13)), it is unclear if this was ordinary light or something else. Similarly, when Peter was in prison, “a light shone in his cell” ([Acts 12:7](https://ref.ly/Acts12:7)). The heavenly city does not need physical light because “the Lord God will shine on them” ([Revelation 22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev22:5); compare [21:11, 23–24](https://ref.ly/Rev21:11)).

The connection between God and light is a common theme in the New Testament. The apostle John wrote, “God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all” ([1 John 1:5](https://ref.ly/1John1:5)). James called God “the Father of the heavenly lights” ([James 1:17](https://ref.ly/Jas1:17)). God is also described as living in light that no person can approach ([1 Timothy 6:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:16); see also [1 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7)). Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” ([John 8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); see also [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5)), and “I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness” ([John 12:46](https://ref.ly/John12:46)). He was the light himself, according to the apostle John ([John 1:1–10](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:10)) John the Baptist came to testify about this light to lead people to faith ([John 1:7–8](https://ref.ly/John1:7-John1:8)). Those who receive the light receive the right to become children of God ([John 1:9–12](https://ref.ly/John1:9-John1:12)). Sometimes, light is used to represent the revelation of people finding the knowledge of God and his salvation ([Matthew 4:16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:16); [Luke 2:32](https://ref.ly/Luke2:32); [Acts 13:47](https://ref.ly/Acts13:47); [26:18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:18)).

John wrote that the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it ([John 1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5); compare [1 John 2:8](https://ref.ly/1John2:8)). He also “The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil” ([John 3:19](https://ref.ly/John3:19)). People who do wrong avoid the light, but those who do good come to the light ([John 3:20–21](https://ref.ly/John3:20-John3:21)). When John describes the raising of Lazarus, Jesus says that men stumble at night because they have no light ([John 11:10](https://ref.ly/John11:10)). Jesus says that men do not have light "in" them, showing that the light is spiritual ([John 8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12)).

Believers are described as “children of light” ([John 12:36](https://ref.ly/John12:36), see also [Luke 16:8](https://ref.ly/Luke16:8)). Their lives are shaped by their connection to the light. Paul also wrote that Christians are “children of light and children of the day” ([1 Thessalonians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:5)). In the first letter of John, Christians are urged to “walk in the light” ([1 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7)), meaning they should live lives of goodness and truth.

Jesus told His followers, “You are the light of the world” ([Matthew 5:14](https://ref.ly/Matt5:14)). This statement means that Christians should reflect God’s light by living godly lives. When Jesus is called the light of the world, it means he can save the world and reveal the truth. When believers are called the light of the world, it is not because they can save the world but because they show the world the way to salvation. Jesus instructed them to let their light shine through their good deeds so that people would praise God ([Matthew 5:16](https://ref.ly/Matt5:14)). Christians must make full use of the light they have. If they ignore it and live in darkness, they are worse off because they know the truth and have chosen to turn away from it ([Matthew 6:23](https://ref.ly/Matt6:23); [Luke 11:35](https://ref.ly/Luke11:35)).

The metaphor of light is not easy to accept by modern people. The Bible teaches that Christ's light has lighted up all Christians. If they ignore the light and live like they are still in the darkness, then they will remain in deep darkness. They are worse than others because they know what light is and what it can mean to them and have turned away from it.
