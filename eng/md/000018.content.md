## Abel (Place) (id: 3282)

ABEL (Place)
============

A strong city on the border of upper Galilee in northern Israel.

The leader of King David's army, Joab, chased a man named Sheba to Abel. Sheba was fighting against David. A wise woman from Abel talked with Joab. After their talk, the people of Abel killed Sheba and threw his head over the city wall. Then Joab stopped attacking the city ([2 Samuel 20:13](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:13-2Sam20:22)–[22](https://ref.ly/2Sam20:13-2Sam20:22)). 

Later, the city was conquered by the Syrian King Ben\-hadad during a war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel. When Asa persuaded Ben\-hadad to break his agreement with Baasha, Ben\-hadad took a large amount of land, including Abel, called Abel\-beth\-maacah ([1 Kings 15:16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:16-1Kgs15:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:16-1Kgs15:20)). 

Sometime later, Tiglath\-pileser III took Abel\-beth\-maacah, also called Abel of Beth\-maacah, or Abel of Beth\-maachah. The people who lived there were taken as prisoners to Assyria ([2 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)). 

Abel is sometimes called Abel\-maim (“meadow of water”). The name shows the city was surrounded by fertile land ([2 Chronicles 16:4](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:4)). The town has been identified with modern Tell Abil\-el\-Qamh.
