## Pastoral Letters (id: 7602)

PASTORAL LETTERS
================

A term used by Bible scholars today to describe the letters 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus. In Christian tradition, these three writings have been grouped together since the second century. They are addressed to individuals rather than to churches, but the benediction (or blessing) at the end of each letter assumes a group of recipients. In general, the letters offer advice to their recipients about church order, false doctrine, leadership standards, and pastoral oversight of church life.
