## Amber (id: 3549)

AMBER
=====

The fossilized resin that comes from some cone\-bearing plants. Over time the resin turns into a clear yellow or orange solid. The word is used in the King James Version to describe a color seen in visions of the Lord ([Ezekiel 8:2](https://ref.ly/Ezek8:2)). The color is similar to that of polished brass or bronze ([Ezekiel 1:4, 27](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:4,Ezek1:27)). *See* Color.
