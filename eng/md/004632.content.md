RABBITH
=======

Town defining the border of Issachar ([Jos 19:20](https://ref.ly/Josh19:20)) and perhaps identifiable with the Levitical town called Daberath ([Jos 19:12](https://ref.ly/Josh19:12); [21:28](https://ref.ly/Josh21:28); [1 Chr 6:72](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:72)). If so, its site is near Mt Tabor at modern Deburiyeh. *See* Daberath.
