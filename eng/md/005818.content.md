## Wild Ox (id: 9065)

WILD OX
=======

A wild ox (*Bos primigenius*) was a large, fierce, agile, stubborn animal. It had a long, lean rump, a straight back, and a long, narrow head. The animal described in [Job 39:9–12](https://ref.ly/Job39:9-Job39:12) is clearly the wild ox. The two horns were its most noticeable feature ([Deuteronomy 33:17](https://ref.ly/Deut33:17)). They were straight and as long as the head ([Numbers 23:22](https://ref.ly/Num23:22); [24:8](https://ref.ly/Num24:8); [Psalm 22:21](https://ref.ly/Ps22:21)). Kings often symbolized their rule by wearing a helmet with two wild ox horns (compare [Psalms 92:10](https://ref.ly/Ps92:10); [132:17–18](https://ref.ly/Ps132:17-Ps132:18)). The Israelites often used horns as drinking vessels. Some could hold 15 liters (four gallons).

Hunting the wild ox was a favorite sport of Assyrian kings. Tiglath\-pileser I hunted in the Lebanon Mountains around 1100 BC (compare [Psalm 29:6](https://ref.ly/Ps29:6)). Some thought that [Job 39:9–12](https://ref.ly/Job39:9-Job39:12) referred to the oryx or antelope because the Hebrew word in Job and Arabian name for oryx are similar. The King James Version translators called the wild ox a "unicorn." They chose that translation because of Babylonian mosaics and Egyptian drawings. These showed the animal in profile with one horn, thus the term "unicorn." Similarly, Jerome's fourth\-century Vulgate and Martin Luther's German translation also did.
