## Arimathea (id: 3738)

ARIMATHEA
=========

The hometown of the Joseph who obtained Jesus’s crucified body and buried it in his own tomb ([Matthew 27:57](https://ref.ly/Matt27:57); [Mark 15:43](https://ref.ly/Mark15:43); [John 19:38](https://ref.ly/John19:38)). The town’s location is unknown. It may be the same as the hill town of Ramathaim\-zophim, the prophet Samuel’s home ([1 Samuel 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1)), about 8 miles (12\.9 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Luke described the place as a Jewish town, and Joseph was himself a Jewish official ([Luke 23:50](https://ref.ly/Luke23:50)).
