## Servant of the Lord (id: 8243)

SERVANT OF THE LORD
===================

A title applied to a variety of persons in the Bible. The basic term, "servant," covers a range of meanings. Used some 800 times in the Old Testament alone, "servant" refers to:

* a slave,
* an officer close to the king, or
* the chosen leader of God’s people.

Servants of the Lord in the Old Testament
-----------------------------------------

[Isaiah 41:8–9](https://ref.ly/Isa41:8-Isa41:9) defines this highest servanthood as something granted by God’s grace. "But you, O Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham My friend—I brought you from the ends of the earth and called you from its farthest corners. I said, ‘You are My servant.’ " This title applies to heroes of faith and action: 

* to the patriarchs ([Genesis 26:24](https://ref.ly/Gen26:24); [Ezekiel 28:25](https://ref.ly/Ezek28:25); [37:25](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:25))
* to Moses ([Exodus 14:31](https://ref.ly/Exod14:31); [1 Kings 8:53, 56](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:53,1Kgs8:56))
* to David ([2 Samuel 7:26–29](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:26-2Sam7:29); [Jeremiah 33:21–26](https://ref.ly/Jer33:21-Jer33:26); [Ezekiel 37:24](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24)) and his descendants (as Hezekiah, Eliakim, Zerubbabel—[Haggai 2:23](https://ref.ly/Hag2:23))
* to the prophets ([2 Kings 10:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:10); [14:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:25))
* to other faithful Israelites, such as Joshua and Caleb ([Numbers 14:24](https://ref.ly/Num14:24); [Joshua 24:29](https://ref.ly/Josh24:29); [Judges 2:8](https://ref.ly/Judg2:8))

Prophets other than Isaiah use this term, but only Zechariah joins him in giving a messianic prediction to this name. [Zechariah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Zech3:8) says, "Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.” Some would see Zerubbabel as the person meant here (compare [Zechariah 6:12](https://ref.ly/Zech6:12)). Isaiah uses "Branch" as a special term for the promised savior, the Messiah, in Isaiah ([Isaiah 11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1)). Jeremiah also uses "Branch" to refer to the Messiah ([Jeremiah 33:15](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15)).

The Servant of the Lord as the Messiah
--------------------------------------

*"The* servant of the Lord," in biblical usage, points to the Messiah and alludes to Isaiah’s central message. Isaiah and others use "servant" with a range of meanings. Isaiah composed some passages known as the Servant Songs. These distinctive sections of his book are unique in content. They cannot be taken out of context without interrupting the flow of prophecy. Isaiah’s focus is on the future Messiah\-servant. The New Testament references to Isaiah are united in a messianic understanding of Isaiah’s servant. The New Testament frequently applies this understanding to Jesus Christ.

The idea of Jesus as a servant is very important in the book of Acts ([Acts 3:13, 26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:13,Acts3:26); [4:27, 30](https://ref.ly/Acts4:27,Acts4:30)). It is also important in the book of 1 Peter. These parts of the New Testament often describe Jesus using words that remind us of the "servant of the Lord" we read about in the Old Testament. Scholars call this way of understanding Jesus a "servant Christology." There are also many references to the messianic servant in the Gospels. Jesus quotes [Isaiah 53](https://ref.ly/Isa53:1-Isa53:12) only in [Luke 22:37](https://ref.ly/Luke22:37), but he seems to be referring to it in [Mark 10:45, 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark10:45,Mark10:14), and possibly [9:12](https://ref.ly/Mark9:12). 

Peter emphasizes the idea that Jesus's suffering had a special purpose. He teaches that Jesus suffered to save people from their sins and bring them back to God ([1 Peter 2:21–25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:21-1Pet2:25); [3:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18)). He seems to emphasize the theme of [Isaiah 53](https://ref.ly/Isa53:1-Isa53:12) as a summary of Old Testament prophecy ([1:11](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:11)). Old Testament prophecy points to "the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow." Paul includes these elements ([1 Corinthians 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3); [Philippians 2:6–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:6-Phil2:11); compare [Romans 4:25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:25); [5:19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:19); [2 Corinthians 5:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21)). John’s "Lamb of God" title references both [Isaiah 53:7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7) and the sacrificial system.
