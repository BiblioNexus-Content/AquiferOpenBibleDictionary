## Nicolas, Nicolaus (id: 7397)

NICOLAS, NICOLAUS
=================

Nicolas was one of the seven men named in [Acts 6:5](https://ref.ly/Acts6:5) who was chosen to serve in the early Jerusalem church. His job, as specified in [Acts 6:1–4](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:4), was to make sure food was distributed fairly and equally among all church members. People traditionally call these seven men "deacons" (which means "servers") because [Acts 6:1](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1) uses terms like "daily distribution" or "service" and [6:2](https://ref.ly/Acts6:2) uses phrases like "to wait on tables" or "to serve."

Nicolas is the last name in the list. The Bible identifies him as a proselyte, which means he was a gentile (non\-Jewish person) who had converted to Judaism before becoming a Christian. He had a Greek name, and his home city was Antioch. The New Testament does not give us any more information about him.
