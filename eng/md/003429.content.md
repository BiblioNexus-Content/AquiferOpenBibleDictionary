## Lasharon (id: 6685)

LASHARON
========

Town in Canaan conquered by Joshua ([Jos 12:18](https://ref.ly/Josh12:18)). Another early manuscript reads “the king of Aphek in Sharon,” perhaps indicating that Lasharon was not the name of a town but part of a phrase distinguishing this city from the other Apheks mentioned in the Bible.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 12:18
