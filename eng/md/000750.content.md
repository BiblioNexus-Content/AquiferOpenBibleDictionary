## Baruch (id: 4019)

BARUCH
======

1. Neriah’s son, Baruch. He was the secretary of the prophet Jeremiah. In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim of Judah, Baruch wrote down Jeremiah’s prophecy about the evil that God would bring upon Judah if the nation did not repent ([Jeremiah 36:4](https://ref.ly/Jer36:4)). This happened sometime between 605 and 604 BC. God also gave Baruch a special message through Jeremiah about being humble in service ([Jeremiah 45](https://ref.ly/Jer45:1-Jer45:5)).

    Baruch read Jeremiah’s prophecy to the people and the leaders ([Jeremiah 36:9](https://ref.ly/Jer36:9-Jer36:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer36:9-Jer36:19)[19](https://ref.ly/Jer36:9-Jer36:19)). When King Jehoiakim heard the message, he destroyed the scroll and ordered the arrest of Baruch and Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 21](https://ref.ly/Jer36:21-Jer36:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer36:21-Jer36:26)[26](https://ref.ly/Jer36:21-Jer36:26)). While in hiding, Baruch again wrote down Jeremiah’s prediction of Judah’s destruction ([Jeremiah 27](https://ref.ly/Jer36:27-Jer36:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer36:27-Jer36:32)[32](https://ref.ly/Jer36:27-Jer36:32)). Baruch was the brother of Seraiah, a close associate of King Zedekiah. Later, Nebuchadnezzar took Seraiah to Babylon with the king. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar surrounded the city to attack it (this happened a year before the final destruction of Jerusalem). Jeremiah bought a field to symbolize Israel's future restoration. He ordered Baruch to keep the purchase documents safe ([Jeremiah 32:12](https://ref.ly/Jer32:12-Jer32:15)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer32:12-Jer32:15)[15](https://ref.ly/Jer32:12-Jer32:15)).

    Two months after Jerusalem's destruction in 586 BC, some rebellious Jews killed Gedaliah. He was the Babylonian\-appointed governor of Judah. The Jews had planned to escape to Egypt. Jeremiah advised them to stay in Jerusalem, but the rebels blamed Baruch for influencing Jeremiah and forced both of them to go to Egypt ([Jeremiah 43:1](https://ref.ly/Jer43:1-Jer43:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Jer43:1-Jer43:7)[7](https://ref.ly/Jer43:1-Jer43:7)).

    The Bible does not mention the final events in Baruch’s life. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt, Baruch was taken to Babylon. The apocryphal book of Baruch (not included in some Bibles) starts by saying the author was in Babylon ([Baruch 1:1](https://ref.ly/Bar1:1-Bar1:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Bar1:1-Bar1:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Bar1:1-Bar1:3)). However, both accounts may not be accurate based on historical evidence.

2. Zabbai’s son, also named Baruch. He was involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s wall around 445 BC under Nehemiah’s supervision ([Nehemiah 3:20](https://ref.ly/Neh3:20)).
3. An individual who signed Ezra’s promise of faithfulness to God with Nehemiah and others after the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 10:6](https://ref.ly/Neh10:6)). This person is possibly the same as \#2 above.
4. Col\-hozeh’s son, and father of Maaseiah ([Nehemiah 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5)).
