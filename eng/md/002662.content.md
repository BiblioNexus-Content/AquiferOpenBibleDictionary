## Horonite (id: 5910)

HORONITE
========

Reference to either the residence or birthplace of Sanballat, who opposed Nehemiah’s restoration program ([Neh 2:10, 19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:10,Neh2:19); [13:28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:28)). The name probably derives from the two cities of Upper and Lower Beth\-horon.
