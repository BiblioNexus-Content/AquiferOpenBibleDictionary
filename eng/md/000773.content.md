## Beam (id: 4044)

BEAM
====

1. A weaver’s beam—a round wooden roller that cloth or carpet was wound around during the weaving process in Bible times. The spears of the giant Goliath ([1 Samuel 17:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:7); [2 Samuel 21:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19); [1 Chronicles 20:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5)) and an Egyptian killed by Benaiah, one of David’s mighty men ([1 Chronicles 11:23](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:23)), were compared to a weaver’s beam.
2. A tree trunk or log that has been cut and used for building purposes. King Solomon used cedar beams and planks to build the temple ([1 Kings 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:9); [2 Chronicles 3:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:7)) and his “House of the Forest of Lebanon” ([1 Kings 7:2, 12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:2,1Kgs7:12)). Another mention of cedar beams probably refers to their aroma ([Song of Solomon 1:17](https://ref.ly/Song1:17)).
3. The crossbeam of a Hebrew balance from which cords hung the scales.
4. A beam (King James Version) or log (Revised Standard Version) that Jesus mentioned ([Matthew 7:3](https://ref.ly/Matt7:3-Matt7:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt7:3-Matt7:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Matt7:3-Matt7:5); [Luke 6:41](https://ref.ly/Luke6:41-Luke6:42)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke6:41-Luke6:42)[42](https://ref.ly/Luke6:41-Luke6:42)). Jesus compared the beam in an accuser’s eye with the mote (King James Version) or speck (Revised Standard Version) in his brother’s eye.
