## Massa (id: 6972)

MASSA
=====

Ishmael’s seventh son and Abraham’s grandson ([Gn 25:14](https://ref.ly/Gen25:14); [1 Chr 1:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:30)). His descendants inhabited northwestern Arabia. Tiglath\-pileser III mentions these people, along with the inhabitants of Tema (cf. [Gn 25:15](https://ref.ly/Gen25:15)) and others who were ruled by him and paid tribute to him. The people of Tema probably were descendants of Massa’s brother Tema.

Massa forms part of the titles of [Proverbs 30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1) and [31:1](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1). The definite article precedes it in [30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1) and can be translated “the burden” or “the oracle.” It is frequently used in prophetic passages in the ominous sense of God’s impending judgment ([Is 13:1](https://ref.ly/Isa13:1); [Na 1:1](https://ref.ly/Nah1:1); [Hb 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hab1:1)).
