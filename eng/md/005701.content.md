## Ucal (id: 8951)

UCAL\*
======

Disciple of Agur, the wise man whose sayings are recorded in the book of Proverbs ([Prv 30:1](https://ref.ly/Prov30:1); see nlt mg). The meaning of the passage is obscure. Many have suggested that the names Ithiel and Ucal are not proper nouns but should be translated, “I am weary and worn out, O God.”
