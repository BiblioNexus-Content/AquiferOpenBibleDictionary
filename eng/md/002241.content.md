## God As Father (id: 5240)

GOD AS FATHER
=============

The Bible describes God as the Father in different ways. As the Creator, He is the Father of all people ([Malachi 2:10](https://ref.ly/Mal2:10); [Acts 17:28](https://ref.ly/Acts17:28)). But in a special way, God is the Father of those who believe in him. He cares for, protects, and guides them ([John 1:12–13](https://ref.ly/John1:12-John1:13); [Romans 8:14–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:14-Rom8:17)).

The relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Son reveals the deepest meaning of God's fatherhood. At Jesus’s baptism, God spoke from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!" ([Matthew 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17)). Unlike believers, who are God's children by adoption, Jesus is God's eternal Son. He said, "I and the Father are one" ([John 10:30](https://ref.ly/John10:30)). This shows that he shares the same divine nature as the Father. 

Jesus revealed what God the Father is like. He told His disciples, "Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father" ([John 14:9](https://ref.ly/John14:9)). Jesus always did what pleased his Father ([John 8:29](https://ref.ly/John8:29)). He taught people about God's fatherly love. He encouraged his followers to pray to God as "our Father in heaven" ([Matthew 6:9](https://ref.ly/Matt6:9)). This prayer (called the Lord's Prayer) teaches us to trust in God's care and seek his will.

Through Jesus, believers can have a close relationship with God as their Father, being brought into God's family through faith ([Galatians 4:4–7](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4-Gal4:7)).
