## Michal (id: 7112)

MICHAL
======

Michal was the younger daughter of King ([1 Samuel 14:49](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:49)). She fell in love with David after he defeated Goliath ([18:20](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:20)). Saul, who was jealous of David, first offered his older daughter, Merab, to David. But David turned down the offer. When Saul found out that Michal loved David, he offered her instead. Saul told David he could marry Michal if he killed 100 Philistines and brought back proof. Saul hoped David would die trying to meet this demand

David met Saul’s demand and killed 200 Philistines. Then he married Michal. But this made Saul even more jealous. He planned to have David killed. When Michal heard about the plan, she helped David escape([1 Samuel 19:8–17](https://ref.ly/1Sam19:8-1Sam19:17)). While David was away, Saul gave Michal to another man named Palti as a wife ([25:44](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:44)).

After Saul died, Abner made a peace agreement with David. One part of the agreement was that Michal would return to David’s household. This happened even though Palti was very sad to lose her ([2 Samuel 3:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:12-2Sam3:16)). But the relationship between Michal and David had changed. When David brought the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem, he danced with joy. Michal saw him and spoke sharply against his actions. David answered her with a strong reply. After this, Michal had no children. Some people believe this happened because of her harsh words to David ([2 Samuel 6:16–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:16-2Sam6:23)). 

The King James Version, following the Masoretic Text, says that Michal had five sons ([2 Samuel 21:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:8)). However, according to [1 Samuel 18:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19) says that Adriel was married to Merab, not Michal. Most modern versions correct this likely scribal error by identifying Merab as the mother instead. This reading fits better with the rest of the Bible.

Michal showed great courage and deep love. She told David she loved him, even though women usually did not speak first in courtship.  
She saved David’s life, even though it put her own life in danger. She was forced to marry another man and later taken from him. This caused her deep emotional pain.  
She also spoke out when she believed David acted wrongly, even though it was unpopular. David became more famous, but we should not forget Michal’s strength.
