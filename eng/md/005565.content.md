## Theophilus (id: 8815)

THEOPHILUS
==========

1. A person to whom Luke wrote two books of the New Testament: the Gospel of Luke and Acts ([Luke 1:3](https://ref.ly/Luke1:3); [Acts 1:1](https://ref.ly/Acts1:1)). The name "Theophilus" means either "lover of God" or "loved by God" in Greek. Because of this meaning, some people think Theophilus might not be a real person's name. They suggest it could be a title used to address all readers of these books.

    However, this is unlikely for two reasons. First, the New Testament usually uses real names rather than titles when addressing people. Second, Luke calls Theophilus "most excellent," a term of respect used for important officials. For example, Paul used this same title when speaking to Festus, and both Claudius Lysias and Tertullus used it when addressing Felix ([Acts 23:26](https://ref.ly/Acts23:26); [24:2](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Acts24:2-Acts24:3); [26:25](https://ref.ly/Acts26:25)).

    While Theophilus was probably an important person in society, we do not know exactly what position he held.

2. The Jewish high priest from AD 37 to 41\. He came from an important religious family. His father was Annas, his brother was Jonathan, and his brother\-in\-law was Caiaphas. Vitellius, who ruled the area for Rome, made Theophilus the high priest after Jonathan. King Herod Agrippa later removed Theophilus from this position.

    This Theophilus was probably the high priest who gave Paul permission to arrest Christians. Though he played this important role, his name does not appear in the New Testament.
