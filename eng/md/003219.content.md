## Judah (Person) (id: 6476)

JUDAH (Person)
==============

1. The fourth of Jacob’s 12 sons ([Genesis 35:23](https://ref.ly/Gen35:23); [1 Chronicles 2:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1)) and Leah and Jacob's fourth son. Leah named him Judah, which means “praise,” because she was excited to give Jacob another son ([Genesis 29:35](https://ref.ly/Gen29:35)). Judah had five sons:

    1. Er
        2. Onan
        3. Shelah, born to Bathshua the Canaanites ([Genesis 38:3](https://ref.ly/Gen38:3-Gen38:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen38:3-Gen38:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Gen38:3-Gen38:5); [1 Chronicles 2:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:3))
        4. The twins Perez and Zerah by Tamar, his daughter\-in\-law ([Genesis 38:29](https://ref.ly/Gen38:29-Gen38:30)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen38:29-Gen38:30)[30](https://ref.ly/Gen38:29-Gen38:30); [1 Chronicles 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:4))
        He eventually settled his family in Egypt with his father and brothers ([Exodus 1:2](https://ref.ly/Exod1:2)). God killed his first two sons, Er and Onan, in Canaan for their disobedience ([Genesis 46:12](https://ref.ly/Gen46:12)). Judah became the founder of one of Israel’s 12 tribes ([Numbers 1:26](https://ref.ly/Num1:26-Num1:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Num1:26-Num1:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Num1:26-Num1:27)).

    Judah was reckless with Tamar ([Genesis 38:6](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:30)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:30)[30](https://ref.ly/Gen38:6-Gen38:30)). However, he showed strong decision\-making when he took personal responsibility for Benjamin’s safety in Egypt and spoke for his brothers before Joseph ([Genesis 44:14–18](https://ref.ly/Gen44:14-Gen44:18)). At the time of Jacob’s blessing, Judah was given firstborn privileges. Judah's family would lead Jacob’s family, and the promised Messiah of Abraham’s covenant would be a Judahite ([Genesis 49:8–12](https://ref.ly/Gen49:8-Gen49:12)). Later, Judah’s family was praised at the time of Ruth’s engagement to Boaz ([Ruth 4:12](https://ref.ly/Ruth4:12)), and both the Davidic lines of kings ([1 Chronicles 2:1–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:1-1Chr2:15); [3:1–24](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:1-1Chr3:24)) and Jesus Christ was a Judahite ([Matthew 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Matt1:2-Matt1:3); [Luke 3:33](https://ref.ly/Luke3:33)).

2. The father of a family of Levites who assisted Jeshua, the high priest, with rebuilding the temple during the time after the exile in Babylon ([Ezra 3:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:9)). He is also called Hodaviah in [Ezra 2:40](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40) and Hodevah in [Nehemiah 7:43](https://ref.ly/Neh7:43).

    *See* Hodaviah \#4.

3. One of the Levites who was encouraged by Ezra to divorce his non\-Jewish wife ([Ezra 10:23](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:23)).
4. Benjamite, son of Hassenuah, who was second in command over the city of Jerusalem during the days of Nehemiah ([Nehemiah 11:9](https://ref.ly/Neh11:9)).
5. One of the leaders of the Levites who returned with Zerubbabel and Jeshua to Judah after the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 12:8](https://ref.ly/Neh12:8)).
6. One of the princes of Judah who helped dedicate the Jerusalem wall during the time after the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 12:34](https://ref.ly/Neh12:34)).
7. One of the priests who played a musical instrument at the dedication of the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah ([Nehemiah 12:36](https://ref.ly/Neh12:36)). He is perhaps identical with \#5 above.
8. Joseph’s son, father of Simeon and an ancestor of Jesus Christ ([Luke 3:30](https://ref.ly/Luke3:30)).
