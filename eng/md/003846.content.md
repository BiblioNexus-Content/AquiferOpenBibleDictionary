MICA
====

A common name that is interchangeable with Micah. It is probably a shortened form of Micaiah.

1. A son of Mephibosheth. He received benefits from King David's kindness to his father. He was also affected when Ziba betrayed his father ([2 Samuel 9:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:12)).
2. A Levite who was the son of Zicri from the clan of Asaph ([1 Chronicles 9:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:15)). He seems to have been one of the priests who was sent away from his homeland. His son Mattaniah was among the first group of people who returned from exile. [Nehemiah 11:17](https://ref.ly/Neh11:17,Neh11:22) and [22](https://ref.ly/Neh11:17,Neh11:22) call him, “the son of Zabdi.” [Nehemiah 12:35](https://ref.ly/Neh12:35) calls him “Micaiah, the son of Zaccur.”
3. A man who set his seal on the covenant of Ezra during the time after the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 10:11](https://ref.ly/Neh10:11)).
