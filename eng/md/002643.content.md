## Honey (id: 5891)

HONEY
=====

A sweet, thick liquid produced by bees ([Judges 14:8](https://ref.ly/Judg14:8)). Honey can be either wild ([1 Samuel 14:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:25-1Sam14:26)) or farmed (likely so in [2 Chronicles 31:5](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:5)). Sometimes, however, it may refer to thick grape syrup (as in Arabic) or date syrup (as described by Josephus). Honey was considered one of life’s necessities ([Sirach 39:26](https://ref.ly/Sir39:26)). However, one must not eat too much ([Proverbs 25:16, 27](https://ref.ly/Prov25:16,Prov25:27)). It was part of the diet of John the Baptist ([Mark 1:6](https://ref.ly/Mark1:6)) and of Immanuel ([Isaiah 7:15](https://ref.ly/Isa7:15)). Its exclusion, along with leaven, from grain offerings ([Leviticus 2:11](https://ref.ly/Lev2:11)) is undoubtedly because it is susceptible to fermentation (a process that converts sugars to alcohol). Its sweetness became a familiar metaphor ([Judges 14:18](https://ref.ly/Judg14:18); [Psalm 19:10](https://ref.ly/Ps19:10); [Revelation 10:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rev10:9-Rev10:10)).
