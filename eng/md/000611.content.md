## Auranus (id: 3880)

AURANUS
=======

A leader chosen by Lysimachus, the brother of the high priest. Lysimachus chose Auranus to stop the Jews who were very angry ([2 Maccabees 4:40](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:40)). The text says Auranus was not in his right mind (he was mentally unwell). The Syriac version of the Apocrypha (books that some churches include in the Bible, but others do not) says he was the leader of a group of violent criminals.
