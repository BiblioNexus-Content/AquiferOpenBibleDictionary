## The Way (id: 9042)

THE WAY
=======

"The Way" is one of the names applied to the early Christian community ([Acts 9:2](https://ref.ly/Acts9:2)). Both Jewish people and non\-religious people used this name when talking about Christians. The name appeared in both positive and negative discussions about the church ([19:9, 23](https://ref.ly/Acts19:9,Acts19:23); [22:4](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4); [24:14, 22](https://ref.ly/Acts24:14,Acts24:22)). 

The apostle Paul used the term in his defense before the Roman governor Felix. This suggests that the name had some kind of official acceptance ([24:14, 22](https://ref.ly/Acts24:14,Acts24:22)). Most likely, this name came from Jesus's own statement “I am the way and the truth and the life” ([John 14:6](https://ref.ly/John14:6)).
