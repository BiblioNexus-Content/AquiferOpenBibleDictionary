## Shilonite (id: 8398)

SHILONITE
=========

1\. Inhabitant of Shiloh, the hometown of Ahijah the prophet ([1 Kgs 11:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:29); [12:15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:15); [15:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:29); [2 Chr 9:29](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:29); [10:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:15)). *See* Shiloh.

2\. Hometown of the forefather of a family of exiles who returned to Jerusalem following the Babylonian captivity ([1 Chr 9:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:5); [Neh 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5)). This place is probably the same as \#1 above. However, “Shilonite” should possibly be “Shelanite”; the niv and nlt read “Shelah” in [Nehemiah 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5) (kjv “Shiloni”). *See* Shelah \#2.
