## Orphan (id: 7521)

ORPHAN
======

A person who no longer has one or both parents, often because of death. The word comes from a Hebrew root meaning "to be alone" or "bereaved," and is often translated as "fatherless." The idea describes any person without legal protection in Israel's covenant community. They are unprotected or needy, and especially vulnerable to oppression. It also speaks of one who lacks the care of one or both earthly parents (compare [Lamentations 5:3](https://ref.ly/Lam5:3)).

God shows special concern for orphans ([Exodus 22:22–24](https://ref.ly/Exod22:22-Exod22:24); [Deuteronomy 10:18](https://ref.ly/Deut10:18); [Psalms 10:14, 18](https://ref.ly/Ps10:14,Ps10:18); [27:10](https://ref.ly/Ps27:10); [68:5](https://ref.ly/Ps68:5); [146:9](https://ref.ly/Ps146:9); [Isaiah 1:17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:17); [Hosea 14:3](https://ref.ly/Hos14:3)). Old Testament laws protected their rights of inheritance ([Numbers 27:7–11](https://ref.ly/Num27:7-Num27:11); [Deuteronomy 24:17](https://ref.ly/Deut24:17); [Proverbs 23:10](https://ref.ly/Prov23:10)). The law allowed them to take food from the fields and vineyards ([Deuteronomy 24:19–21](https://ref.ly/Deut24:19-Deut24:21)). It also allowed them to participation in the great annual feasts ([Deuteronomy 16:11, 14](https://ref.ly/Deut16:11,Deut16:14)). They were also given a part of the tithe crops collected every three years ([Deuteronomy 14:29](https://ref.ly/Deut14:29); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Deut26:12)). The Bible strongly condemns those who mistreat orphans ([Deuteronomy 24:17](https://ref.ly/Deut24:17); [27:19](https://ref.ly/Deut27:19); [Malachi 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mal3:5)).

Friends and relatives sometimes helped orphans in Israel ([Job 29:12](https://ref.ly/Job29:12); [31:17](https://ref.ly/Job31:17)). But many people failed to follow these laws. This failure is shown by the accusations of the writers of the Bible ([Job 6:27](https://ref.ly/Job6:27); [22:9](https://ref.ly/Job22:9); [24:3, 9](https://ref.ly/Job24:3,Job24:9); [Psalm 94:6](https://ref.ly/Ps94:6); [Isaiah 1:23](https://ref.ly/Isa1:23); [10:2](https://ref.ly/Isa10:2); [Jeremiah 5:28](https://ref.ly/Jer5:28); [Ezekiel 22:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek22:7)). As a result, the prophets often pleaded for better treatment of orphans ([Jeremiah 7:6](https://ref.ly/Jer7:6); [22:3](https://ref.ly/Jer22:3); [Zechariah 7:10](https://ref.ly/Zech7:10)).

The New Testament uses the word only twice. Once, it describes those who are desolate or in "distress" ([John 14:18](https://ref.ly/John14:18)), The second use describes the "fatherless"([James 1:27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27)). In the spirit of an Old Testament prophet, James says that true religion includes caring for orphans.
