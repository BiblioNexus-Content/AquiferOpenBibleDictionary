## Jazer (id: 6244)

JAZER
=====

Jazer was a town east of the Jordan River in the region of Gilead.

The Israelites took Jazer and its nearby villages when Moses was their leader ([Numbers 21:32](https://ref.ly/Num21:32)). The tribes of Gad and Reuben wanted to live there because the land was good for raising animals. They had many flocks and herds ([32:1–5](https://ref.ly/Num32:1-Num32:5)). They promised to build protection for their women and children. Then they would go with the other tribes to fight in Canaan (verses [6–27](https://ref.ly/Num32:6-Num32:27)). 

Jazer marked part of the border of the land given to the tribe of Gad ([Joshua 13:25](https://ref.ly/Josh13:25)). It was also given to the Levites ([Joshua 21:39](https://ref.ly/Josh21:39); [1 Chronicles 6:81](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:81)). Later, Joab came to Jazer when King David sent him to count the people of Israel ([2 Samuel 24:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:5)). Jazer is also mentioned when David looked for “capable men” to serve ([1 Chronicles 26:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:31)). 

About 200 years later, the nation of Moab took control of Jazer ([Isaiah 16:6–9](https://ref.ly/Isa16:6-Isa16:9); [Jeremiah 48:32](https://ref.ly/Jer48:32)).
