## Jehoiada (id: 6277)

JEHOIADA
========

1\. Father of Benaiah, a high military officer during the reigns of David and Solomon. Jehoiada was a priest ([1 Chr 27:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:5)) who joined forces with David at Hebron and was identified with the house of Aaron ([12:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:27)). *See* Benaiah \#1.

2\. High priest in Jerusalem who organized and led the coup that overthrew Queen Athaliah of Judah, together with the Baal cult she supported, and established his nephew Joash (Jehoash) on the throne ([2 Kgs 11:4–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:4-2Kgs11:21); [2 Chr 23:1–15](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:1-2Chr23:15)). As long as he lived, Jehoiada kept the king true to the Lord ([2 Kgs 12:1–16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:1-2Kgs12:16); [2 Chr 23:16–24:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:16-2Chr24:14)). He died at the age of 130 and was buried in the city of David among the kings.

3\. Benaiah’s son, who succeeded Ahithophel as King David’s counselor ([1 Chr 27:33–34](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:33-1Chr27:34)); he was probably a grandson of \#1 above, although some believe these to be the same.

4\. KJV spelling of Joiada, Paseah’s son, in [Nehemiah 3:6](https://ref.ly/Neh3:6). *See* Joiada \#1.

5\. Alternate name for Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, in [Nehemiah 13:28](https://ref.ly/Neh13:28). *See* Joiada \#2.

6\. Priest during the time of Jeremiah who was succeeded by Zephaniah as overseer of the temple ([Jer 29:26](https://ref.ly/Jer29:26)).
