## Be-Eshterah (id: 4074)

BE\-ESHTERAH
============

A city in the half\-tribe of Manasseh that was given to the Levitical family of Gershonites in the dividing of the promised land ([Joshua 21:27](https://ref.ly/Josh21:27)). The name is a shortened form for *Beth\-ashtaroth* (“house or place of Ashtaroth”). It is probably the same as the city of Ashtaroth ([1 Chronicles 6:71](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:71)). 

*See* Ashtaroth, Ashterathite; Levitical Cities.
