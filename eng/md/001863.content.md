## Ephraim, Tribe of (id: 5118)

EPHRAIM, Tribe of
=================

The tribe descended from Joseph’s second son. Both Ephraim and his brother Manasseh were seen as sons also by their grandfather Jacob and became his heirs.

The Territory of the Tribe of Ephraim
-------------------------------------

Many Bible commentators think that Ephraim is a play on words based on a Hebrew root meaning “to be fruitful” ([Genesis 41:52](https://ref.ly/Gen41:52)). The hill country given to Ephraim was among the most fertile areas in Palestine, rich in vines, fruit trees, and dense forests ([Joshua 17:18](https://ref.ly/Josh17:18)). Even when kings ruled Israel, this region was still home to wild animals ([2 Kings 2:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs2:24)).

It is not clear where the borders of Ephraim are because it is often mentioned alongside the territory of Manasseh. Ephraim’s land was located in the center of Canaan, between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Manasseh's territory was located to the north ([Joshua 16:5](https://ref.ly/Josh16:5-Josh16:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh16:5-Josh16:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Josh16:5-Josh16:9)).

Ephraim's Rise and Influence in Israel
--------------------------------------

Ephraim grew into a powerful and influential tribe. At the first census in the wilderness, 40,500 Ephraimite soldiers were counted ([Numbers 1:33](https://ref.ly/Num1:33)). However, this number decreased to 32,500 by the time of the second census ([Numbers 26:37](https://ref.ly/Num26:37)). Ephraim was assigned the leadership of the western camp of Israel, between the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin ([Numbers 2:18](https://ref.ly/Num2:18-Num2:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Num2:18-Num2:24)[24](https://ref.ly/Num2:18-Num2:24)).

Joshua, the son of Nun, one of the 12 spies, was descended from Ephraim ([Numbers 13:8](https://ref.ly/Num13:8), “Hoshea”). Joshua's leadership strengthened Ephraim's importance among the tribes of Israel. ([Joshua 16](https://ref.ly/Josh16:1-Josh16:10)).

During the time of the judges, the Ephraimites often became angry when they were left out of important battles. They felt they were being treated unfairly or disrespected. They fought with: 

* Gideon after his victory over the Midianites ([Judges 8:1](https://ref.ly/Judg8:1-Judg8:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg8:1-Judg8:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Judg8:1-Judg8:6))
* Jephthah of Gilead, who defeated the Ammonites ([Judges 12:1](https://ref.ly/Judg12:1-Judg12:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg12:1-Judg12:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Judg12:1-Judg12:6))

The judge Abdon came from Ephraim’s tribe ([Judges 12:13](https://ref.ly/Judg12:13)). Micah, who worshiped false gods, as well as the prophet Samuel, lived in Ephraim ([Judges 17:1](https://ref.ly/Judg17:1); [1 Samuel 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1)). Ephraim's military and political importance is shown in the Song of Deborah, an ancient biblical poem ([Judges 5:14](https://ref.ly/Judg5:14)).

Ephraim in the Northern Kingdom of Israel
-----------------------------------------

Ephraim was a significant rival to the tribe of Judah, with tensions persisting even during King David's reign ([2 Samuel 18](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:33); [19:41–20:22](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:41-2Sam20:22)). These tensions contributed to the eventual division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign ([1 Kings 11:26–40](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:26-1Kgs11:40)). The northern tribes, including Ephraim, were unhappy with the rule from Jerusalem. This unhappiness led the 10 northern tribes, led by Jeroboam I, to separate from the southern tribes and form their own kingdom. It was called the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The capitals of the northern kingdom—Shechem, Tirzah, and Samaria—were all located within Ephraim's territory. The establishment of Samaria by King Omri enhanced Ephraim's strategic importance by providing direct access to the Via Maris, a major trade route along the sea. However, this increased exposure to trade also brought greater temptation for the northern kingdom to stray from God.

Despite Ephraim's role in the division of the kingdom, the prophets foretold a future reunification of Ephraim with Judah in a future kingdom ruled by God's chosen leader ([Hosea 1:11](https://ref.ly/Hos1:11)). A descendant of David would heal the division caused by Jeroboam I and restore unity among all the tribes of Israel ([Ezekiel 37](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:28)).
