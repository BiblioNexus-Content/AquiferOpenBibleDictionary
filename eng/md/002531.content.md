First of 22 cities mentioned in the territory allotted to Asher’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 19:25](https://ref.ly/Josh19:25)). Helkath was one of four cities in Asher given to the Levitical Gershonite families ([21:31](https://ref.ly/Josh21:31)). It is alternately spelled Hukok in [1 Chronicles 6:75](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:75). Its ancient site is perhaps located at the modern Tell el\-Harbaj.
