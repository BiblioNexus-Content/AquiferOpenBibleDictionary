## Age (id: 3421)

AGE
===

A long period of time with no exact beginning or end. It can refer to the past or the future. 

The Bible describes God as existing and planning "before the ages" ("before time began" in the Berean Standard Bible; [1 Corinthians 2:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:7)). He is the King of ages ("King eternal" in the Berean Standard Bible; [1 Timothy 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:17)). He has an eternal purpose ([Ephesians 3:11](https://ref.ly/Eph3:11)). The Bible also talks about what God will do at the end of the age(s) ([Matthew 13:39](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:49)–[49](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39-Matt13:49)).

The New Testament builds on earlier Jewish writings when it talks about two different time periods. There is "the present age," which is seen as "evil" ([Galatians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Gal1:4)). And there is "the age to come" when God will judge and set things right, and God's people will inherit their full blessing ([Mark 10:30](https://ref.ly/Mark10:30)). The Bible suggests we are now living at "the fulfillment of the age" ([1 Corinthians 10:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:11)). At the same time, we can experience some of "the powers of the coming age" ([Hebrews 6:5](https://ref.ly/Heb6:5)) and its life. This means that the future perfect age has started to overlap with the present age.

The word "age" is sometimes linked with "generation." [Colossians 1:26](https://ref.ly/Col1:26) mentions a mystery hidden "for ages and generations" (compare [Ephesians 3:21](https://ref.ly/Eph3:21)). However, the Bible does not divide time into periods with different ways to be redeemed. 

Another related term is "world." [Ephesians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Eph2:2) describes unredeemed humanity as following "the ways of this world." [Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2) and [11:3](https://ref.ly/Heb11:3) speak of God’s creation of the world.

The Bible also discusses human age, counted in years or other ways. Wisdom is often associated with the elderly ([Job 12:12](https://ref.ly/Job12:12)). However, wisdom in old age is not guaranteed ([Ecclesiastes 4:13](https://ref.ly/Eccl4:13)). Age should be respected ([Leviticus 19:32](https://ref.ly/Lev19:32)). Long life is a blessing from God ([Proverbs 16:31](https://ref.ly/Prov16:31)). Yet, old age is recognized as frail ([Ecclesiastes 12:1](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1-Eccl12:6)–[6](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1-Eccl12:6)). [Psalm 90:10](https://ref.ly/Ps90:10) says a human lifespan is typically 70 years, extending to 80 with "labor and sorrow."
