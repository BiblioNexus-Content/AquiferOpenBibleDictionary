## Mahalab (id: 6861)

MAHALAB\*
=========

Reconstructed name of a town in Asher’s tribe ([Jos 19:29](https://ref.ly/Josh19:29), nlt “Mehebel”); the Hebrew text has a transposition of the last two consonants, but the town is probably the same as Ahlab and Helbah of [Judges 1:31](https://ref.ly/Judg1:31). The correct name is preserved in the Assyrian annals of Sennacherib as Mahalliba; another text has Mahalab. The town is sometimes identified with Khirbet el\-Mahalib, northeast of Tyre.

*See also* Ahlab.
