## Kiriathaim (id: 6600)

KIRIATHAIM
==========

1\. Town on the Moabite plateau, mentioned in the march of the four kings against the five ([Gn 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5)) where the indigenous Emim were attacked. It was taken by the Israelites from Sihon ([Nm 32:37](https://ref.ly/Num32:37)) and included in Reuben’s inheritance ([Jos 13:19](https://ref.ly/Josh13:19)). The Moabite Stone records that Sihon fortified the place after gaining control of the plateau; in the seventh century BC it was still under Moabite control ([Jer 48:1, 23](https://ref.ly/Jer48:1,Jer48:23); [Ez 25:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:9)). Eusebius placed it 10 Roman miles west of Medeba. Two identifications have been proposed—either Khirbet el\-Qureiyeh or Qaryat el\-Mukhaiyet, six miles (9\.7 kilometers) northwest and three miles (4\.8 kilometers) northwest of Medeba respectively.

2\. Levitical town in Naphtali’s territory ([1 Chr 6:76](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:76)), called Kartan in [Joshua 21:32](https://ref.ly/Josh21:32); the latter is probably a dialectical variant. The suggested identification is with Khirbet el\-Qurieyeh, northeast of ‘Ain Ibl in southern Lebanon.
