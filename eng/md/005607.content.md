TIPHSAH
=======

1\. City on the northeastern boundary of Solomon’s empire ([1 Kgs 4:24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:24)). It is most likely identified with Thapsacus, a town mentioned frequently in Greek and Roman texts. Though its precise location is unknown, it was an important trading center on the Euphrates River that dominated an east\-west caravan route and also served as a northern terminal for river traffic.

2\. KJV rendering of Tappuah, one of the towns conquered by Menahem after he deposited Shallum in Samaria ([2 Kgs 15:16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:16)). *See* Tappuah (Place) \#2.
