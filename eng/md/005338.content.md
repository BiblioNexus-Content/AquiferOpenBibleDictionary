## Spinner, Spinning (id: 8600)

SPINNER, SPINNING
=================

In all periods of Israel's history, women spun fibers into yarn. But, a class of professional spinners arose alongside them. [Exodus 35:25](https://ref.ly/Exod35:25-Exod35:26)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod35:25-Exod35:26)[26](https://ref.ly/Exod35:25-Exod35:26) mentions women spinners. Among her other virtues, the good wife of [Proverbs 31](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1-Prov31:31) engaged in spinning ([Proverbs 31:19](https://ref.ly/Prov31:19)). Jesus spoke of the lilies of the field that did not need to spin ([Matthew 6:28](https://ref.ly/Matt6:28); [Luke 12:27](https://ref.ly/Luke12:27)).
