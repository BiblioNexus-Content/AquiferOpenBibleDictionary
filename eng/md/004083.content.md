## Nehelamite (id: 7342)

NEHELAMITE
==========

Ancestral name or the geographical designation for Shemaiah the false prophet ([Jer 29:24, 31–32](https://ref.ly/Jer29:24,Jer29:31-Jer29:32)). Its derivation is unknown. Etymologically similar to the Hebrew word for “dream,” Nehelamite is perhaps an epithet coined by Jeremiah to deride Shemaiah, the false prophet, as a dreamer.
