AUTOGRAPH
=========

One of the original handwritten documents of a book that eventually became part of the Bible. None of the original manuscripts of the Bible remain. Instead, copies called apographa are available. Apographa were made by scribes whose occupation was the careful copying of manuscripts. There are enough of these copies to give us confidence that our present Bible accurately preserves the words of the autographs. *See* Bible, Manuscripts and Text of the (both articles).
