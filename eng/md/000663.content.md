## Baal-Berith (id: 3930)

BAAL\-BERITH
============

A pagan god worshiped in central Canaan around the city of Shechem ([Judges 9:1](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:4,Judg9:44-Judg9:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:4)[4, 44](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:4,Judg9:44-Judg9:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:4)[46](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:4,Judg9:44-Judg9:46)). Baal\-berith (meaning “lord of the covenant”) was probably a local form of Baal, the main Canaanite fertility god. During the period of the judges, the people of Israel turned from the Lord to worship the idols Baal and Baal\-berith ([Judges 8:33](https://ref.ly/Judg8:33)).
