## Ashnah (id: 3806)

ASHNAH
======

The name of the two towns that the tribe of Judah received after Israel conquered Canaan ([Joshua 15:33, 43](https://ref.ly/Josh15:33,Josh15:43)). The location of both towns is unknown, but both were in the lowlands separating Judah and Philistia. Although the Philistines were often active in this area, they never got beyond its eastern border.
