## Obadiah (Person) (id: 7450)

OBADIAH (Person)
================

1. Governor of Ahab’s house ([1 Kings 18:3–16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:3-1Kgs18:16)). Obadiah was an important official who managed King Ahab’s household. Elijah met him after a long drought and asked him to bring Ahab to him. Both Ahab and Obadiah were looking for water and grass (verse [5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:3)). Even though Obadiah worked for Ahab, he remained loyal to the Lord. He hid 100 prophets in caves and provided them with food and water.
2. A descendant of King David ([1 Chronicles 3:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:21)).
3. A descendant of Izrahiah from Issachar’s tribe ([1 Chronicles 7:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:3)).
4. Azel’s son and a descendant of King Saul from Benjamin’s tribe ([1 Chronicles 8:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:38); [9:44](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:44)).
5. Son of Shemaiah, who was among the first Levites returning from exile to Jerusalem. He lived in one of the villages of the Netophathites ([1 Chronicles 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:16)). He is called Abda in [Nehemiah 11:17](https://ref.ly/Neh11:17). *See* Abda \#2.
6. A Gadite who joined David at his stronghold in the wilderness. He was a strong warrior, skilled with both shield and spear. He was also very fast ([1 Chronicles 12:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:8-1Chr12:9)).
7. The father of Ishmaiah, commander over the army of Zebulun ([1 Chronicles 27:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:19)).
8. Prince of Judah during King Jehoshaphat’s reign ([2 Chronicles 17:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7)). He joined four other officers and the Levites in teaching the law throughout the cities of Judah.
9. A Levite overseer during King Josiah’s reign ([2 Chronicles 34:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:12)). He was in charge of the repair of the temple.
10. Son of Jehiel ([Ezra 8:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:9)). He joined Ezra in his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem, leading 218 men with him.
11. A priest who signed Ezra’s covenant ([Nehemiah 10:5](https://ref.ly/Neh10:5)).
12. A gatekeeper and Levite who oversaw the storehouses by the gates during the time of Joiakim, son of Jeshua ([Nehemiah 12:25–26](https://ref.ly/Neh12:25-Neh12:26)).
13. A prophet who prophesied (gave a message from God) against Edom. The Edomites had celebrated when Babylon defeated Jerusalem in 597 BC. Obadiah described the behavior of the Edomites in his prophecy ([Obadiah 1:11–14](https://ref.ly/Obad1:11-Obad1:14)). Obadiah's prophecy is the shortest book in the Old Testament. It predicted God’s judgment on Edom (verses [2–10](https://ref.ly/Obad1:2-Obad1:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Obad1:15)).
