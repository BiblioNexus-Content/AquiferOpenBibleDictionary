## Man, Old and New (id: 6928)

MAN, Old and New
================

Biblical terms used to describe the state of man in relation to Christ. Human beings are created in the image of God and are made to have fellowship with him ([Gn 1:26–27](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:27)). God made known to Adam and Eve his will in a specific situation ([2:15–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15-Gen2:17)), yet they used the freedom of their will to disobey God’s command ([3:1–7](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:7)). So the human race is dead in sin ([Rom 5:12–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21); [Eph 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Eph2:1-Eph2:3)). The sin of Adam and Eve has been passed on to all humanity (original sin). Born with the tendency toward sin ([Ps 51:5](https://ref.ly/Ps51:5)), as soon as the age of moral responsibility is reached, individuals begin to commit their own sins. Paul uses the term “old man” to refer to this condition. The old man can keep certain parts of the law and do various good things. But no old man can ever do enough good things to earn his own salvation. The old man must be made into a new man or he will suffer the consequences of his sin. Only God can bring about that radical change. Human beings can only accept by faith God’s gracious gift.

David, in [Psalm 51](https://ref.ly/Ps51:1-Ps51:19), cries out for God to take away the guilt of his sins. In verse [10](https://ref.ly/Ps51:10) he pleads, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me” (rsv). God promises in [Ezekiel 11:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:19), [18:31](https://ref.ly/Ezek18:31), and [36:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:26) to give repentant sinners a new heart and a new spirit. In [Romans 6:5–11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:5-Rom6:11) Paul shows how the old nature has been crucified with Christ, so he can conclude, “So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” ([6:11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:11)). In [Ephesians 4:22–24](https://ref.ly/Eph4:22-Eph4:24) and [Colossians 3:9–10](https://ref.ly/Col3:9-Col3:10) he shows the believer that he has put off the old man and put on the new man. Jesus speaks of this radical transformation as being born anew—not a second physical birth, as Nicodemus thought, but a spiritual birth ([Jn 3:6](https://ref.ly/John3:6)). Only the grace of God can change the old man into the new man. The old man accepts God’s gracious gift by faith, but even that faith is a gift of God ([Eph 2:8](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8)). The new man becomes a child of God. He does not immediately become perfect. He must fight against sin throughout this life as he strives to come closer and closer to the ideal of perfect holiness. He will attain that perfection only in the resurrection to come ([1 Cor 15:42–45](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:42-1Cor15:45)), when all things are made new ([Rv 21:5](https://ref.ly/Rev21:5)).
