HOUR
====

An hour is a unit of time equal to 60 minutes or 1/24th of a day. In biblical times, people divided daylight into 12 hours, measured from sunrise to sunset. Because this system was based on the sun’s movement, the length of an hour varied with the seasons. An hour was longer in summer and shorter in winter.
