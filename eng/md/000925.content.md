## Beth-Peor (id: 4196)

BETH\-PEOR
==========

A Moabite city given that was to the tribe of Reuben when the promised land was divided ([Joshua 13:20](https://ref.ly/Josh13:20)). Before the Israelites entered into the land of Canaan, they made camp in a valley across from Beth\-peor. The people gathered to hear Moses’ final message after he had seen the land from the top of Mount Pisgah ([Deuteronomy 3:29](https://ref.ly/Deut3:29); [4:46](https://ref.ly/Deut4:46)). Moses was buried here after he was forbidden to enter the promised land ([Deuteronomy 34:6](https://ref.ly/Deut34:6)). Baal\-peor (or Baal of Peor) was the name of a local deity worshiped in this area ([Numbers 25:3](https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Num25:3-Num25:5)).
