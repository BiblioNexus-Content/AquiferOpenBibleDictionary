## Magistrate (id: 6854)

MAGISTRATE
==========

The title of a public official who acted as judge and administrator of a given district. King Artaxerxes ordered Ezra to select magistrates along with judges to govern the people when they returned to Palestine ([Ezra 7:25](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:25)). This official was one of the officers of Nebuchadnezzar’s court invited to the dedication feast ([Daniel 3:2](https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Dan3:2-Dan3:3)). [Luke 12:58](https://ref.ly/Luke12:58) portrayed the magistrate as a ruling authority whose verdict was final.

During the Roman era, each colony had two magistrates (called *duumviri*). They judged crimes against the state. So, Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates at Philippi. They were accused of advocating customs unacceptable to the Romans ([Acts 16:20](https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38)[38](https://ref.ly/Acts16:20-Acts16:38)). Before this *duumvir,* they were ordered to be stripped, beaten, and thrown into prison. A chief magistrate was sometimes called a "praetor" (*strategos* in the Greek). It was a special title for a lead *duumvir*.
