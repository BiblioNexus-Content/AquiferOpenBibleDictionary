## Boxthorn (id: 715985)

A boxthorn is a thorny shrub that grows in dry areas. Some species of boxthorn have purplish flowers and brightly colored berries. 

The thornbush in [Judges 9:14–15](https://ref.ly/Judg9:14-Judg9:15) is thought to be to the European boxthorn (*Lycium europaeum*), also called desert\-thorn. It is a thorny shrub that grows 1\.8 to 3\.7 meters (6 to 12 feet) tall. The plant has clusters of leaves and small violet flowers. These flowers eventually produce small, round red berries. The European boxthorn is native to Israel and the surrounding areas. It grows commonly throughout the region, especially in the area from Lebanon to the Dead Sea.
