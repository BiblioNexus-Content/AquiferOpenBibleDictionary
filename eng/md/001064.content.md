## Box Tree (id: 4320)

BOX TREE
========

The long\-leaved box tree (*Buxus longifolia*)is a hardy evergreen tree. It is also known as boxwood. These trees are found in the mountainous regions of the northern part of Israel and the surrounding areas. It grows in the Galilean hills and Lebanon. The tree grows to a height of about 6\.1 meters (20 feet) with a slender trunk. The trunk is usually no more than 15\.2 to 20\.3 centimeters (six to eight inches) in diameter.

The wood of the box tree is very hard and can be polished to a smooth finish. The Romans cultivated the box tree for its hard wood. They used it to make cabinets and jewel boxes with ivory inlays.

The Bible mentions the box tree in [Isaiah 41:19](https://ref.ly/Isa41:19) and [60:13](https://ref.ly/Isa60:13). The Revised Standard Version calls the same tree a "pine."
