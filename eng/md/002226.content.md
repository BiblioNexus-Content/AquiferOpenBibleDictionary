GIZON, GIZONITE\*
=================

Designation for Hashem (Jashen, nlt), one of David’s mighty men ([1 Chr 11:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:34)). Gizon may have been an ancient Canaanite settlement. Some scholars have emended the text to read “Gunite” (cf. [1 Chr 5:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:15); [7:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:13)) or “from Gimzo” (cf. [2 Chr 28:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:18)).
