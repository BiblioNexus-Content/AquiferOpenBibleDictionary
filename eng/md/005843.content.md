## Wool (id: 9088)

WOOL
====

Wool fiber, made from the hair of sheep, was an important product of the ancient Near East. 

King Mesha of Moab, a sheep breeder, sent the wool of 100,000 rams as tribute to King Ahab of Israel each year ([2 Kings 3:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4)). The people of Damascus traded wool with Tyre’s merchants ([Ezekiel 27:18](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:18)). Woolen garments were commonly worn by the Israelites ([Leviticus 13:47–59](https://ref.ly/Lev13:47-Lev13:59); [Isaiah 51:8](https://ref.ly/Isa51:8); [Hosea 2:5, 9](https://ref.ly/Hos2:5,Hos2:9)). Woolen garments mingled with linen fabric were forbidden ([Deuteronomy 22:11](https://ref.ly/Deut22:11)). In fact, wearing any wool was prohibited for Israelite priests serving in the sanctuary’s inner court ([Ezekiel 44:17](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:17)).

Wool is sometimes a biblical symbol for whiteness and purity. It is a simile for:

* redemption ([Isaiah 1:18](https://ref.ly/Isa1:18)),
* the hair of the Ancient of Days ([Daniel 7:9](https://ref.ly/Dan7:9)), and
* the hair and head of the Son of Man ([Revelation 1:14](https://ref.ly/Rev1:14)).
