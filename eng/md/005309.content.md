## Song of Deborah (id: 4786)

SONG OF DEBORAH
===============

The Song of Deborah is an ancient poem found in [Judges 5](https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31). It celebrates an Israelite victory over the Canaanites. This song is similar to Moses's song in [Exodus 15:1–18](https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:18). It also tells the same story as the prose account in [Judges 4\.](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg4:24) The song describes how the Israelites defeated the powerful Canaanite king Jabin of Hazor and his general Sisera with God's help. The song's poetic style and use of old Hebrew forms can be seen in the slightly different translations found in modern Bible versions. The poem's strong language suggests that an eyewitness to the battle wrote it, probably Deborah herself.

[Judges 5:2](https://ref.ly/Judg5:2) addresses Israel with an invitation to praise God. The song also tells foreign kings to learn about Israel's God and what he did. Verses [4–5](https://ref.ly/Judg5:4-Judg5:5) may describe the current battle or God's earlier appearance to Moses at Mount Sinai. Verse [5](https://ref.ly/Judg5:5) could be translated, “The mountains quaked at the presence of the One of Sinai.”

Deborah is first introduced in verse [7](https://ref.ly/Judg5:7). Verse [8](https://ref.ly/Judg5:8) might mean that the Canaanites stopped the Israelites from openly carrying weapons. More likely, it means the Canaanites had destroyed all weapon\-making in Israel (compare [1 Samuel 13:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:19)). During a time of fear and division, Deborah, who was a judge, urged the Israelite tribes to fight. When Deborah asked all the tribes for help, some did not respond, but others came to assist.

The battle took place at Taanach, 24\.1 kilometers (15 miles) southwest of Mount Tabor. The Canaanites had gathered their forces there ([Judges 4:13](https://ref.ly/Judg4:13)). This meant the Israelites lost the advantage of fighting from their mountain position. However, Deborah's song suggests that God helped them, possibly through a strong storm. 

God's help is also mentioned in [Judges 4:14](https://ref.ly/Judg4:14) (“Has not the LORD gone before you?"). The song describes stars fighting against Sisera and the river Kishon flooding. These represent natural forces helping Israel ([Judges 5:20–21](https://ref.ly/Judg5:20-Judg5:21)). Also, the Canaanites' chariots lost their advantage when Jael, a brave Hebrew woman, killed Sisera, the chariot leader ([Judges 5:24–27](https://ref.ly/Judg5:24-Judg5:27)). Sisera's death fulfilled Deborah's prophecy to Barak, the Israelite commander. A woman, not he, would receive glory for that deed ([Judges 4:9](https://ref.ly/Judg4:9)).

The song shows Sisera's mother sadly waiting for him to return. In contrast to this sad picture of the Canaanite woman, Deborah's song ends with a strong prayer for future safety. Although Jael was blessed ([Judges 5:24](https://ref.ly/Judg5:24)) and Deborah was praised, the God of Israel received the glory ([Judges 5:1–3](https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:3)).
