## Nettle (id: 7375)

NETTLE
======

The nettle is a plant with toothed leaves covered with tiny hairs that release a stinging liquid when touched. Four types of nettle grow in Israel and the surrounding areas:

1. The common or great nettle (*Urtica dioica*)
2. The Roman nettle (*Urtica pilulifera*)
3. The small nettle (*Urtica urens*)
4. *Urtica caudata*, which is similar to the small nettle

Some nettles can grow as tall as 1\.5 to 1\.8 meters (five to six feet). They are common weeds found in abandoned areas and fields. They often grow in places that were once farmed but have since been neglected ([Isaiah 34:13](https://ref.ly/Isa34:13); [Hosea 9:6](https://ref.ly/Hos9:6)).
