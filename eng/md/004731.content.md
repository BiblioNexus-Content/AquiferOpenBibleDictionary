## Remission of Sins (id: 7993)

REMISSION OF SINS
=================

A King James Version phrase that carries the same meaning as "forgiveness of sins." The New Testament uses a variety of terms to describe a single truth. Different expressions are used to describe the idea of forgiveness of sins:

* "passing over" in [Romans 3:25](https://ref.ly/Rom3:25)
* "covered" in [Romans 4:7](https://ref.ly/Rom4:7)
* "not imputed" in [Romans 4:8](https://ref.ly/Rom4:8)
* "remembered no more" in [Hebrews 10:17](https://ref.ly/Heb10:17)

One of the most significant ways of expressing forgiveness is the word "remission" ([Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Mark 1:4](https://ref.ly/Mark1:4); [Luke 1:77](https://ref.ly/Luke1:77); [3:3](https://ref.ly/Luke3:3); [24:47](https://ref.ly/Luke24:47); [Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [10:43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:43); [Hebrews 9:22](https://ref.ly/Heb9:22); [10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:18)).

Remission has an interesting tradition in the Greek language. In a legal sense, remission meant dismissal from a job, release from an obligation, or cancellation of a debt or punishment. Over time, it came to mean amnesty or exemption from taxation. 

In New Testament use, the activity of remission means "to let go," "to leave behind," or "to send away." Because of this, the word is often translated into "forgiveness" as well as "remission" ([Acts 5:31](https://ref.ly/Acts5:31); [13:38](https://ref.ly/Acts13:38); [26:18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:18); [Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [Colossians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Col1:14)). While forgiveness can be exercised by both God and humans, the word "remission" almost always means forgiveness given by God ([Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Acts 10:43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:43)).
