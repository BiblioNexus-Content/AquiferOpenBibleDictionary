## Sorcery (id: 8581)

SORCERY
=======

A sorcery practitioner (sorcerer) claims to have supernatural powers to do magic, predict the future, and contact evil spirits through special words and objects. Sorcerers were present in: 

* The royal courts of Egypt ([Exodus 7:11](https://ref.ly/Exod7:11))
* Assyria ([Nahum 3:4](https://ref.ly/Nah3:4))
* Babylonia ([Daniel 2:2](https://ref.ly/Dan2:2))

Sorcery was not allowed in Israel ([Deuteronomy 18:10](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10)). It was punishable by death ([Exodus 22:18](https://ref.ly/Exod22:18)). But the Israelites still looked for sorcerers ([2 Kings 17:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:17); [2 Chronicles 33:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6); [Micah 5:12](https://ref.ly/Mic5:12)). This made God angry ([Isaiah 57:3](https://ref.ly/Isa57:3); [Malachi 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mal3:5)). 

Paul listed sorcery as a sin ([Galatians 5:20](https://ref.ly/Gal5:20)). The book of Revelation says that people who practice sorcery will be thrown into the lake of fire ([Revelations 21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8)). They will be separation from the righteous forever ([Revelation 22:15](https://ref.ly/Rev22:15)).
