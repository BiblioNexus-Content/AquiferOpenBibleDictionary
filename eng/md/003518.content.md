## Longsuffering (id: 6774)

LONGSUFFERING
=============

The term "longsuffering" describes a person's ability to remain patient and endure difficulties for a long time without becoming angry or upset. The word appears four times in the Old Testament ([Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6); [Numbers 14:18](https://ref.ly/Num14:18); [Psalm 86:15](https://ref.ly/Ps86:15); [Jeremiah 15:15](https://ref.ly/Jer15:15)). The New Testament uses this word 13 times. Modern Bible translations often use words like "patience," "endurance," or "forbearance" instead.

The Bible most often uses this term to describe God's character ([Romans 2:4](https://ref.ly/Rom2:4)). A holy God must punish sin. Yet his loving nature delays that punishment. God gives people time to turn away from their sins (repent) and come back to him ([1 Timothy 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:16); [1 Peter 3:20](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:20)). Longsuffering is also a Christian virtue, a "fruit of the Spirit" ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). Christians should show this same kind of patience in how they treat one another.
