## Glean, Gleaning (id: 5485)

GLEAN, GLEANING
===============

Practice of allowing the poor to follow reapers in a field to pick up missed spears of grain (cf. [Lv 19:9](https://ref.ly/Lev19:9); [23:22](https://ref.ly/Lev23:22); [Dt 24:19](https://ref.ly/Deut24:19); [Ru 2:2–23](https://ref.ly/Ruth2:2-Ruth2:23)). Vineyards, as well as fields of grain, were to be available for gleaning ([Lv 19:10](https://ref.ly/Lev19:10); [Dt 24:20–21](https://ref.ly/Deut24:20-Deut24:21)). Olive trees, however, were not to be gone over a second time (cf. [Jgs 8:2](https://ref.ly/Judg8:2); [Is 17:6](https://ref.ly/Isa17:6); [24:13](https://ref.ly/Isa24:13); [Jer 6:9](https://ref.ly/Jer6:9); [Mi 7:1](https://ref.ly/Mic7:1)). The word “gleaned” is also used to describe the killing of men who fled from a battle ([Jgs 20:45](https://ref.ly/Judg20:45), kjv).
