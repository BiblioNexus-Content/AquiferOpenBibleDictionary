## Hieronymus (id: 5845)

HIERONYMUS
==========

Hellenistic ruler in intertestamental period. Hostile toward Palestinian Jews who refused to accept Greek ways, Antiochus Eupator sent his vice\-regent Lysias with 80,000 troops to solicit compliance. Maccabeus and his band, led by an angel, wrecked Lysias’s expedition and evoked a settlement that permitted Jews to maintain their ancestral customs. However, Hieronymus and fellow district governors Timothy, Apollonius, and Demophon would not allow the Jews to live in peace and quiet ([2 Macc 12:2](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:2)).
