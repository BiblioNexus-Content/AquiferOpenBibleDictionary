## Baal-Hazor (id: 3935)

BAAL\-HAZOR
===========

A mountain where King David's son Absalom had a home.

Two years after Amnon raped Absalom’s sister, and his half\-sister, Tamar, Absalom invited Amnon and his other brothers to a feast at Baal\-hazor when the shearers were cutting the wool from sheep ([2 Samuel 13:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21-2Sam13:30)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21-2Sam13:30)[30](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21-2Sam13:30)). During the celebration, Absalom got his revenge: he had Amnon killed.

Baal\-hazor is not the Hazor in the tribal land of Benjamin ([Nehemiah 11:33](https://ref.ly/Neh11:33)). It is also not the Hazor north of the Sea of Galilee in the tribal land of Naphtali ([Joshua 11:10](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Josh11:10-Josh11:11); [1 Kings 9:15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:15); [2 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)). Baal\-hazor was located in the tribal land of Ephraim at Jebel el\-Asur, northeast of Bethel.
