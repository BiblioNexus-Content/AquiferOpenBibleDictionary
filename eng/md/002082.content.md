## Gad (Person) (id: 5342)

GAD (Person)
============

1. One of the 12 sons of Jacob ([Genesis 35:26](https://ref.ly/Gen35:26); [1 Chronicles 2:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:2)). His mother was Zilpah, who served as a maid to Jacob's wife Leah. When Gad was born, Leah was very happy and named him Gad, which means "good fortune" ([Genesis 30:11](https://ref.ly/Gen30:11)). Later, Gad and his family moved with Jacob to Egypt ([Exodus 1:4](https://ref.ly/Exod1:4)).

    Before Jacob died, he gave special blessings to each of his sons. He told Gad that enemies would often attack his people, but they would fight back successfully and win (see [Genesis 49:19](https://ref.ly/Gen49:19) and the article Gad, Tribe of).

    Gad had seven sons ([Genesis 46:16](https://ref.ly/Gen46:16)). His descendants became known as the Gadites ([Deuteronomy 3:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Deut3:12,Deut3:16)). The Gadites formed one of the 12 tribes of Israel ([Numbers 2:14](https://ref.ly/Num2:14)).

2. A prophet and seer during the reign of David. He gave David advice from God about where to go and what to do. When David was hiding from his enemies, Gad told him to leave the town of Mizpeh in Moab and go back to the land of Judah ([1 Samuel 22:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:5)). Later, when David counted his soldiers against God's wishes, Gad told him about his punishment from God ([2 Samuel 24:11–14, 18–19](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:11-2Sam24:14,2Sam24:18-2Sam24:19); [1 Chronicles 21:9–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr21:9-1Chr21:19)).

    Gad also helped David and another prophet named Nathan organize how people would worship God in the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:25](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:25)). He wrote down the events of David's life as a record for future generations ([1 Chronicles 29:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:29)).
