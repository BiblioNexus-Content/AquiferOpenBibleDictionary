## Woman (id: 9086)

WOMAN
=====

A woman is an adult female human being. God created woman to be a companion for man ([Genesis 2:18–22](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:22)).

The Creation of Woman
---------------------

Genesis provides two accounts about how God created the first man and woman. In the first account, [Genesis 1:26–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28), God created humans in his image, as male and female. Both the man and the woman share the image of God. This means they both reflect God's power and greatness on the earth. God told them to have children and take care of the world. In [Genesis 1:26–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:26-Gen1:28), there is no suggestion that the woman is less important than the man, or that she must submit to his dominance. Instead, the passage shows them together, male and female, as a representation of their Creator.

The second story about the creation of woman is in [Genesis 2:20–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:20-Gen2:25). In [Genesis 2](https://ref.ly/Gen2:1-Gen2:25), God created the man before the woman. Some people think this shows that the man might have some greater importance. But in the creation stories, God often creates things in stages, from less complex to more beautiful or complete. 

Because the man was created first, he had the right to name the woman ([Genesis 2:23](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23)). In Semitic culture, giving a name often showed authority or ownership. This might mean that Adam's naming of his wife was an act of authority. But the name he gave her (“woman”) was closely linked to the word for “man,” which showed that the man affirmed the woman's equality with him. So even though there is some order in their creation, the man and woman are still partners. The relationship is both structured and equal.

[Genesis 1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31) and [2](https://ref.ly/Gen2:1-Gen2:25) describe a balanced relationship between the man and the woman, the first parents of all humankind. God made both of them in his image. They were partners in God's plan. However, they also had a one\-to\-one relationship where one led the other. Before sin entered the world (an even often called the Fall), this balance of equality and leadership worked in harmony.

What Changed for Women After the Fall
-------------------------------------

[Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24) tells the story of sin entering the world. Because of sin, the good relationship between the man and the woman was damaged. God spoke to the woman and told her that she would have pain when giving birth to children ([Genesis 3:16](https://ref.ly/Gen3:16)). He also said that her relationship with her husband would now include conflict. God said, “Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.” 

The Hebrew word “desire” *(teshuqah)* in the [Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24) and [4](https://ref.ly/Gen4:1-Gen4:26) passages does not mean sexual longing. Instead, it means a desire to control or to be in charge (the sexual meaning of *teshuqah* is found in [Song of Songs 7:10](https://ref.ly/Song7:10)). Because of sin, the woman may try to take control over her husband. At the same time, the man may try to rule over her in a harsh way. This was not how God first designed their relationship. Sin brought a struggle between two equal partners.

In his letter to the Ephesians, the apostle Paul gives guidance to husbands and wives. He teaches that both men and women need to be changed by God’s Spirit. Paul says “Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord” ([Ephesians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Eph5:22)). This means a wife should respect her husband and follow his lead, just as she follows Jesus. Paul explains that the husband is called to lead in a way that reflects how Christ leads the church ([Ephesians 5:23](https://ref.ly/Eph5:23)). 

But Paul also speaks strongly to husbands. He says they must love their wives “just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her” ([Ephesians 5:25](https://ref.ly/Eph5:25)). This kind of love is not harsh or controlling. It is full of care, sacrifice, and kindness.

Paul quotes [Genesis 2:24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24) in [Ephesians 5:31](https://ref.ly/Eph5:31) to remind his readers that marriage was meant to bring deep unity. In Christ, this unity can be restored. The husband and wife are still equal in value. Their roles are different, but their relationship is based on love, respect, and mutual submission [(Ephesians 5:21\)](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21). When they follow Jesus together, they can begin to recover the peace and joy that was once found in Eden.

The Role of Women in Life According to the Bible
------------------------------------------------

A woman is fully a person, just like a man. She is made in the image of God and reflects God's nature. She has the ability to think, create, love, and serve in many ways in her culture, her community, and her daily life.

The Bible often associates women with childbearing. Many women in Scripture found great meaning in bearing and raising children. But the Bible also shows that a woman’s worth does not depend on childbearing. She has value in every part of life. She has her own identity in the family, in the community, in the church, and before God, whether or not she has children.

The Bible also shows that childbearing is not the woman’s job alone. The husband is her partner. He shares in the beginning of life, stands with her in times of birth, and helps care for the child as they grow.

The Bible connects women with a special promise from God. In [Genesis 3:15](https://ref.ly/Gen3:15), after the first sin, God gave a message of hope. He said that one day, the offspring (child) of the woman would defeat the evil one, Satan. This promise gave new meaning to childbearing. It became a sign of hope and blessing.

This promise points to the birth of Jesus, who was born of a woman. Through him, God would bring salvation to the world. Every birth after that can be seen as a small part of that story, a reminder of God’s promise to bring life and healing through the family of humankind.

Some Christians see this idea in [1 Timothy 2:15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:15). That verse says that women will be saved through childbearing. This does not mean that having children brings salvation. Instead, it may point to the long story of God’s promise being fulfilled through the birth of Christ.

In the Old Testament world, people often believed that a woman’s value came mainly from having children. But the Bible shows that a woman’s true worth does not depend only on childbearing. Like a man, a woman finds her deepest purpose through faith in God.

A woman may have many children and feel fulfilled. But caring for her children is not the same as knowing and honoring God. Her relationship with God is what matters most.

A woman who has no children, or even no husband, still has full worth and identity. She is made in God’s image. She can serve him in many ways. Her life has meaning because of God, not because of her family status.

God's gifts in a woman's life can lead her to find ways to show her devotion to God in the community. For example, women had the same opportunities as men to take a Nazirite vow ([Numbers 6:2](https://ref.ly/Num6:2); see also chapter [30](https://ref.ly/Num30:1-Num30:16)).

The Bible tells the stories of many women who served God in public ways. Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, was a prophetess, a musician, and a leader of the people ([Exodus 15:20–21](https://ref.ly/Exod15:20-Exod15:21); [Numbers 12](https://ref.ly/Num12:1-Num12:16)). Long after she died, God reminded Israel that he had given them Miriam as a leader ([Micah 6:4](https://ref.ly/Mic6:4)). 

Other women also lived faithful and courageous lives. Deborah was a prophetess and the only woman named as a judge over Israel ([Judges 4–5](https://ref.ly/Judg4:1-Judg5:31)). Esther was a Hebrew woman who became queen of Persia. She saved her people from death by bravely speaking to King Xerxes. Huldah was another prophetess. She spoke God’s message to King Josiah when he began to lead the people back to God ([2 Chronicles 34:22–28](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:22-2Chr34:28)). This was during the time of Jeremiah and Zephaniah. Even though there were male prophets, God chose to speak through Huldah in that moment.

The New Testament also names many women who served God in public ways: 

* the daughters of Philip (who were prophets)
* Phoebe
* Priscilla
* Junias
* Tryphena
* Tryphosa
* Persis
* Euodia
* Syntyche

These women show the beginning of what the prophet Joel had spoken long ago. Joel said that one day God’s Spirit would be poured out on both men and women, and they would speak God’s words ([Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)). Other women, like Sarah, Ruth, and Hannah, served God through faith in their homes and families. They trusted in God and lived in obedience to him.

The most honored woman in the Bible is Mary, the mother of Jesus. She trusted God and gave birth to the Savior. In Mary, the promise given to Eve was fulfilled and through her, the one who would defeat the enemy of humankind was born.
