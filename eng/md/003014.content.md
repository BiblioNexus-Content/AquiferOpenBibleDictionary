JEHIEL
======

1\. KJV spelling of Jeiel, King Saul’s ancestor, in [1 Chronicles 9:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35). *See* Jeiel \#2.

2\. KJV spelling of Jeiel, Hotham’s son, in [1 Chronicles 11:44](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:44). *See* Jeiel \#3.

3\. A Levite musician who, along with other Levites appointed by David, played a psaltery at the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chr 15:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:18-1Chr15:20)). Afterward, he was appointed to a permanent ministry of music in the sanctuary ([1 Chr 16:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:5)).

4\. Levite of the family of Gershon; a chief of the house of Ladan ([1 Chr 23:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:8), nlt mg). He was in charge of the temple treasury during David’s reign—an office that seems to have continued in the family ([29:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:8))—and founder of a priestly family called Jehieli or Jehielites ([26:21–22](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:21-1Chr26:22)).

5\. Hacmoni’s son who, with David’s uncle Jonathan (a counselor and a scribe), was appointed to take care of the king’s sons as a tutor and adviser ([1 Chr 27:32](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:32)).

6\. Son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, placed by his father over one of the fortified cities of Judah ([2 Chr 21:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:2)). He and five brothers were slain by Jehoram when Jehoram became king.

7\. One of the Kohathite Levites from the family of Heman who assisted in King Hezekiah’s reforms ([2 Chr 29:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14), rsv “Jehuel”). He may be the same Levite who was assigned to oversee the reception and distribution of the sacred offerings ([2 Chr 31:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:13)).

8\. One of the chief officers of the temple at the time of Josiah’s religious reformation ([2 Chr 35:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:8)); he contributed many sacrifices for the great Passover service.

9\. Father of Obadiah from Joab’s house; he returned with Ezra from Babylon ([Ezr 8:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:9)).

10\. One of the sons of Elam and father of Shecaniah. He was associated with Ezra’s marriage reforms ([Ezr 10:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:2)) and was perhaps the same Jehiel who was among those who divorced their foreign wives (v[26](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:26)).

11\. Priest who was among those Ezra persuaded to divorce their foreign wives ([Ezr 10:21](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:21)).
