## Aristarchus (id: 3741)

ARISTARCHUS
===========

A companion of the apostle Paul. Aristarchus was a Macedonian from Thessalonica, possibly of Jewish ancestry. He is first mentioned as one of those seized by an angry mob in Ephesus ([Acts 19:29](https://ref.ly/Acts19:29)). 

Later, Aristarchus went with Paul on the return from his third missionary journey ([Acts 20:4](https://ref.ly/Acts20:4)). He also went to Rome with Paul to face Caesar ([Acts 27:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts27:1-Acts27:2)). 

Paul described Aristarchus as a coworker ([Philemon 1:24](https://ref.ly/Phlm1:24)) and fellow prisoner. Paul received great comfort from Aristarchus' friendship ([Colossians 4:10–11](https://ref.ly/Col4:10-Col4:11)). Tradition says that Roman Emperor Nero killed Aristarchus in Rome as a martyr.
