## Abana (id: 3266)

ABANA
=====

A river that runs through the city of Damascus in Syria. Today, it is called the Barada River.

Naaman thought the Abana River would be better for healing his leprosy than the Jordan River. However, he decided to obey the prophet Elisha. He washed in the Jordan River and was cured of his leprosy ([2 Kings 5:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:9-2Kgs5:14)–[14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:9-2Kgs5:14)).

Abana is called “Amana” in [2 Kings 5:12\.](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:12)
