## Hobab (id: 5866)

HOBAB
=====

A member of the Midianite people who was connected to Moses's family ([Numbers 10:29](https://ref.ly/Num10:29); [Judges 4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)). He was either Moses's father\-in\-law or his brother\-in\-law. If he was Moses's father\-in\-law, he was also known by two other names. He is usually called Jethro ([Exodus 3:1](https://ref.ly/Exod3:1); [4:18](https://ref.ly/Exod4:18); [18:1–12](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1-Exod18:12)). But he is also called Reuel ([Exodus 2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18)). Jethro served as a priest of Midian ([Exodus 18:1](https://ref.ly/Exod18:1)). He was the ancestor of the Kenite people ([Judges 4:11\).](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11)

Scholars are not sure whether Hobab was Moses's father\-in\-law or brother\-in\-law. In [Judges 4:11](https://ref.ly/Judg4:11), Hobab seems to be the same person as Jethro. Some ancient copies of the Bible add the name"Hobab" when mentioning "the Kenite, Moses' father\-in\-law" in [Judges 1:16](https://ref.ly/Judg1:16). They also add his name when talking about Reuel in [Exodus 2:18](https://ref.ly/Exod2:18). However, [Numbers 10:29a](https://ref.ly/Num10:29) could mean that Hobab was Reuel's son (making him Moses's brother\-in\-law). In this passage, Moses asks Hobab to help guide the Israelites through the wilderness because he knew the area well.
