## Besom (id: 4146)

BESOM
=====

An old English word meaning “broom” ([Isaiah 14:23](https://ref.ly/Isa14:23), King James Version). The Berean Standard Bible and other modern translations use "broom" instead of "besom." The besom, or broom, of destruction, is a metaphor in the Near East, signifying total destruction. It refers to the destruction or “sweeping away” of Babylon by the Lord.
