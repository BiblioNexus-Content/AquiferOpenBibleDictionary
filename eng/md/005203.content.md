## Shur (id: 8467)

SHUR
====

The wilderness region located in the Sinai Peninsula east of Egypt’s Nile Delta and west of the Negev. In ancient times, a caravan route passed through this region from Egypt to Palestine. Abraham lived for a time between Shur and Kadesh ([Genesis 20:1](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1)). Ishmaelites also lived in the area ([Genesis 25:18](https://ref.ly/Gen25:18)). After crossing the Red Sea, Moses led Israel on a three\-day journey through this dry land ([Exodus 15:22](https://ref.ly/Exod15:22)). King Saul of Israel conquered the Amalekites near Shur ([1 Samuel 15:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:7)). Later, David defeated the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites here ([1 Samuel 27:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8)). [Numbers 33:8](https://ref.ly/Num33:8) calls the area the wilderness of Etham.
