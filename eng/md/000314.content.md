## Amphipolis (id: 3576)

AMPHIPOLIS
==========

A city in ancient Greece. It was once the home of the Thracian Edoni tribe. Amphipolis occupied a strategic location in a fertile area on the eastern bank of the Strymon River. Its name means “around city.” This may refer to the river which surrounds the city on three sides. It is located about 48\.2 kilometers or 30 miles from Philippi. It eventually became an important station on the Roman road called the Via Egnatia. On his second missionary journey, Paul passed through this commercial center on his way to Thessalonica ([Acts 17:1](https://ref.ly/Acts17:1)).
