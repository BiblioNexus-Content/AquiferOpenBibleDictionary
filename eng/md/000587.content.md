## Ataroth (id: 3856)

ATAROTH
=======

1. A town in the mountainous region east of the Jordan River. Ataroth was rebuilt by the tribe of Gad ([Numbers 32:3, 33](https://ref.ly/Num32:3,Num32:33-Num32:36)–[36](https://ref.ly/Num32:3,Num32:33-Num32:36)). It was mentioned in the famous Moabite Stone by King Mesha, who said he brought back the “altar of David” from Ataroth. This Ataroth is probably modern\-day Khirbet Attarus.
2. A town on the southern border of Ephraim’s tribal land ([Joshua 16:2](https://ref.ly/Josh16:2)), possibly the same as Ataroth\-addar ([Joshua 16:5](https://ref.ly/Josh16:5); [18:13](https://ref.ly/Josh18:13)).
3. A town in the Jordan Valley on the northeast border of Ephraim’s tribal land ([Joshua 16:7](https://ref.ly/Josh16:7)).
