## Gath-Rimmon (id: 5378)

GATH\-RIMMON
============

1\. City located in the land allotted to Dan’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 19:45](https://ref.ly/Josh19:45)). It was assigned as one of the four Levitical cities for the Kohathites in Dan ([21:24](https://ref.ly/Josh21:24)). Lost to the Canaanites, Gath\-rimmon was later regained by Ephraim and included as one of its cities for the sons of Levi ([1 Chr 6:69](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:69)). Its site is identifiable with the modern Tell el\-Jerisheh.

*See also* Levitical Cities.

2\. One of two cities given to the Levites in Manasseh west of the Jordan River ([Jos 21:25](https://ref.ly/Josh21:25)), suggesting a possible transcription mistake, which is better read as Bileam (cf. [1 Chr 6:70](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:70)).
