## Choba (id: 4539)

CHOBA
=====

Village mentioned in the book of Judith as being fortified by the Jews when Assyrian commander Holofernes invaded Palestine ([Jdt 4:4](https://ref.ly/Jdt4:4)). The precise location cannot be identified, but it may be el\-Makhubbi, three miles (4\.8 kilometers) from Besan, or possibly the Hobah of [Genesis 14:15](https://ref.ly/Gen14:15). The account indicates that the Jews pursued Holofernes’ army to Choba and beyond Damascus ([Jdt 15:4–5](https://ref.ly/Jdt15:4-Jdt15:5)).
