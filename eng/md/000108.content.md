ADASA
=====

1. A town mentioned during the period of the Maccabean revolt. At Adasa, Judas Maccabeus defeated the Syrian army under Nicanor in 161 BC. The victory was celebrated annually on the 13th of Adar ([1 Maccabees 7:40, 45, 49](https://ref.ly/1Macc7:40,1Macc7:45,1Macc7:49)). The modern site is probably Khirbet ’Adassa, 7 miles (11 kilometers) from Beth\-horon.
2. The leader of a group of Babylonian exiles returning to Judah who could not prove their Jewish ancestry ([1 Esdras 5:36](https://ref.ly/1Esd5:36)). The same name, spelled Addon, might refer to an otherwise unknown place in the Babylonian Empire ([Nehemiah 7:61](https://ref.ly/Neh7:61)).
