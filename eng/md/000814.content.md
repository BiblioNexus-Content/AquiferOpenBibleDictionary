## Bela (Person) (id: 4085)

BELA (Person)
=============

1. Beor’s son, a king of Edom who ruled before Israel had a king ([Genesis 36:31](https://ref.ly/Gen36:31-Gen36:33)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen36:31-Gen36:33)[33](https://ref.ly/Gen36:31-Gen36:33)). Balaam, the pagan prophet from north Syria, also had a father named Beor ([Numbers 22:5](https://ref.ly/Num22:5)). So, some scholars have confused the Edomite Bela with Balaam.
2. Benjamin’s oldest son ([Genesis 46:21](https://ref.ly/Gen46:21); [1 Chronicles 8:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:1)), whose descendants were called Belaites ([Numbers 26:38](https://ref.ly/Num26:38)).
3. Azaz’s son, a descendant of Reuben. He lived in Gilead in Transjordan. His family had so much land that their cattle lived near the Euphrates River ([1 Chronicles 5:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:8-1Chr5:9)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:8-1Chr5:9)[9](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:8-1Chr5:9)). In the reign of Saul, his family defended their land against a Hagrite opposition.
