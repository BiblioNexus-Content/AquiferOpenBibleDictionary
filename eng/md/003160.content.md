## Joiarib (id: 6419)

JOIARIB
=======

1\. One of the Jewish leaders whom Ezra sent to Iddo at Casiphia to gather Levites and temple servants for the caravan of Jews returning to Palestine from Babylon ([Ezr 8:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:16)). He is alternately called Jehoiarib in [1 Chronicles 9:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:10).

2\. Zechariah’s son, the father of Adaiah, and an ancestor of a Judahite family that resettled in Jerusalem during the postexilic era under Nehemiah ([Neh 11:5](https://ref.ly/Neh11:5)).

3\. Father of Jedaiah, a priest who served in the temple during the days of Nehemiah ([Neh 11:10](https://ref.ly/Neh11:10)). Perhaps Joiarib’s forefather was Jehoiarib, who was the head of the first course of priests ministering in the sanctuary during David’s reign ([1 Chr 24:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:7); cf. [9:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:10)).

4\. One of the leaders of the priests who returned with Zerubbabel and Jeshua to Judah after the exile ([Neh 12:6](https://ref.ly/Neh12:6)). His family in the next generation was headed by Mattenai (v [19](https://ref.ly/Neh12:19)).
