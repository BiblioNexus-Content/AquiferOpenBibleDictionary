NECROMANCER, NECROMANCY
=======================

A necromancer is someone who tries to talk with dead people. Necromancy is the practice of trying to communicate with the dead to learn secrets or predict the future. God's law strictly forbade the Israelites from doing this ([Deuteronomy 18:11](https://ref.ly/Deut18:11)).
