## Zion, Daughter of (id: 9233)

ZION, Daughter of
=================

A term in prophetic literature. It designates the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Zion) and nearby areas. It also referred to those in Babylon exiled from Jerusalem and Judea ([Isaiah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Isa1:8); [Jeremiah 4:31](https://ref.ly/Jer4:31); [6:2, 23](https://ref.ly/Jer6:2)). Ancient cities were seen as the mother of their inhabitants. So, it was appropriate to call the people of Jerusalem the "daughters of Zion," especially in poetry. Israel was to be the "virgin daughter" of spiritual Zion ([2 Kings 19:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:21); [Isaiah 37:22](https://ref.ly/Isa37:22); [Lamentations 2:13](https://ref.ly/Lam2:13)). But, many prophetic contexts judge the unfaithful "daughters" ([Isaiah 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/Isa3:16-Isa3:17); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Isa4:4); [Micah 1:13](https://ref.ly/Mic1:13)). God judged the "daughters of Zion" for their unfaithfulness. But, God promised to deliver them ([Isaiah 52:2](https://ref.ly/Isa52:2); [62:11](https://ref.ly/Isa62:11); [Zechariah 9:9](https://ref.ly/Zech9:9); [Matthew 21:5](https://ref.ly/Matt21:5); [John 12:15](https://ref.ly/John12:15)).
