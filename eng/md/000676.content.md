## Baal-Shalishah (id: 3946)

BAAL\-SHALISHAH
===============

The home of a man who brought a sack of fresh grain and 20 barley loaves to Elisha at Gilgal. Elisha's servant fed 100 young prophets with it and had some left over ([2 Kings 4:42](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:42)). Baal\-shalishah was probably in a fertile area where early crops were grown.
