6\. Harim’s son, who obeyed Ezra’s exhortation to divorce his pagan wife after the exile ([Ezr 10:31](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:31), kjv “Malchiah”). He repaired part of the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah ([Neh 3:11](https://ref.ly/Neh3:11)).

The princes attempted to do so by throwing him into Malchijah’s cistern.
