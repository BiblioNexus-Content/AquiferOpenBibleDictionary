## Foreigner (id: 5289)

FOREIGNER
=========

 A person who is not a citizen. A foreigner may be a temporary guest, temporary resident, or stranger.

The Hebrew word meaning “foreigner” is translated correctly on all occasions in the Revised Standard Version. However, the King James Version uses it in its truest sense on only two occasions ([Deuteronomy 15:3](https://ref.ly/Deut15:3); [Obadiah 1:11](https://ref.ly/Obad1:11)). In most cases, the King James Version translates the word as “alien” ([Deuteronomy 14:21](https://ref.ly/Deut14:21); [Job 19:15](https://ref.ly/Job19:15); [Psalm 69:8](https://ref.ly/Ps69:8); [Lamentations 5:2](https://ref.ly/Lam5:2)) or “stranger” ([Genesis 15:13](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13); [Exodus 2:22](https://ref.ly/Exod2:22); [Leviticus 25:35](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35)). Another Hebrew word means “dweller” or “settler” ([Leviticus 25:35](https://ref.ly/Lev25:35); [1 Chronicles 29:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:15); [Psalm 39:12](https://ref.ly/Ps39:12)). However, it is most often translated “foreigner.”

A temporary guest or sojourner was usually someone who wanted to take up temporary residence or had moved from one tribe of people to another and then attempted to obtain certain advantages or rights belonging to the native people living there. A whole tribe might be temporary residents in Israel. This was the case with the Gibeonites ([Joshua 9](https://ref.ly/Josh9:1-Josh9:27)) and the Beerothites ([2 Samuel 4:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam4:3); compare [2 Chronicles 2:17](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:17)). The Israelites themselves were temporary residents in the land of Egypt ([Genesis 15:13](https://ref.ly/Gen15:13); [23:4](https://ref.ly/Gen23:4); [26:3](https://ref.ly/Gen26:3); [47:4](https://ref.ly/Gen47:4); [Exodus 2:22](https://ref.ly/Exod2:22); [23:9](https://ref.ly/Exod23:9)) and in other lands ([Ruth 1:1](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:1)).

Foreigners or temporary residents had certain rights while in Israel. But they also had certain limitations. They could offer sacrifices ([Leviticus 17:8](https://ref.ly/Lev17:8); [22:18](https://ref.ly/Lev22:18)) but could not enter the sanctuary unless circumcised ([Ezekiel 44:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:9)). They were allowed to participate in the three great Jewish festivals ([Deuteronomy 16:11, 14](https://ref.ly/Deut16:11,Deut16:14)) but could not eat the Passover meal unless circumcised ([Exodus 12:43, 48](https://ref.ly/Exod12:43,Exod12:48)). Foreigners were not obliged to follow the Israelite religion, but they shared in some of its benefits ([Deuteronomy 14:29](https://ref.ly/Deut14:29)). They were not to work on the Sabbath or the Day of Atonement ([Exodus 20:10](https://ref.ly/Exod20:10); [23:12](https://ref.ly/Exod23:12); [Leviticus 16:29](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29); [Deuteronomy 5:14](https://ref.ly/Deut5:14)) and could be stoned for reviling or blaspheming God’s name ([Leviticus 24:16](https://ref.ly/Lev24:16); [Numbers 15:30](https://ref.ly/Num15:30)). Foreigners were forbidden to eat blood ([Leviticus 17:10–12](https://ref.ly/Lev17:10-Lev17:12)) but could eat animals that had died a natural death ([Deuteronomy 14:21](https://ref.ly/Deut14:21)). Israel’s code of sexual morality also applied to the foreigner ([Leviticus 18:26](https://ref.ly/Lev18:26)). There were prohibitions against Israelites intermarrying with foreigners, but it was nevertheless a common occurrence ([Genesis 34:14](https://ref.ly/Gen34:14); [Exodus 34:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Exod34:12,Exod34:16); [Deuteronomy 7:3–4](https://ref.ly/Deut7:3-Deut7:4); [Joshua 23:12](https://ref.ly/Josh23:12)).

The rights of citizens were provided for foreigners by the law of Moses ([Exodus 12:49](https://ref.ly/Exod12:49); [Leviticus 24:22](https://ref.ly/Lev24:22)). They came under the same legal processes and punishments ([Leviticus 20:2](https://ref.ly/Lev20:2); [24:16, 22](https://ref.ly/Lev24:16,Lev24:22); [Deuteronomy 1:16](https://ref.ly/Deut1:16)). They were to be treated politely ([Exodus 22:21](https://ref.ly/Exod22:21); [23:9](https://ref.ly/Exod23:9)). They were to be loved as those under the love of God ([Leviticus 19:34](https://ref.ly/Lev19:34); [Deuteronomy 10:18–19](https://ref.ly/Deut10:18-Deut10:19)). And they were to be treated generously ([Leviticus 19:10](https://ref.ly/Lev19:10); [23:22](https://ref.ly/Lev23:22); [Deuteronomy 24:19–22](https://ref.ly/Deut24:19-Deut24:22)). They could receive asylum (protection or shelter) in times of trouble ([Numbers 35:15](https://ref.ly/Num35:15); [Joshua 20:9](https://ref.ly/Josh20:9)). Foreign servants were to receive treatment equal to Hebrew servants ([Deuteronomy 24:14](https://ref.ly/Deut24:14)). A foreigner could not take part in tribal deliberations or become a king ([17:15](https://ref.ly/Deut17:15)). The prophet Ezekiel looked forward to the future time when the Messiah will reign. Then the foreigner would share all the blessings of the land with God’s own people ([Ezekiel 47:22–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:22-Ezek47:23)).

In the New Testament, “foreigner” is often used symbolically. On the one hand, the work of Christ allowed all foreigners ((or example, those separated from Christ) to become members of God’s household ([Ephesians 2:11–19](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:19)). On the other hand, Christians should consider themselves foreigners in this world ([Hebrews 11:13](https://ref.ly/Heb11:13); [1 Peter 2:11](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:11)).
