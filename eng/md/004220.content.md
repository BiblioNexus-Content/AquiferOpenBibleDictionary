## Oleander (id: 718703)

Oleander
========

A poisonous evergreen shrub that grows in warm climates. One suggestion for the plants called "roses" in various Bible translations is the oleander ([Sirach 24:14](https://ref.ly/Sir24:14), King James Version). This plant originally came from the East Indies but has been grown throughout warm regions of the world for hundreds of years.

The oleander (*Nerium oleander*)grows well in Israel and the surrounding areas. It forms thick clusters in some parts of the Jordan Valley. It is usually a shrub that grows from 0\.9 to 3\.7 meters (3 to 12 feet) tall. Every part of the oleander plant is dangerously poisonous.
