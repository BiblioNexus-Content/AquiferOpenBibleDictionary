## Hallel (id: 5611)

HALLEL
======

A Hebrew word describing a song of praise to God. Later, in the Talmud (Jewish religious law) and the writings of the rabbis (or teachers), it referred to groups of psalms of praise to God. [Psalms 113–118](https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps118:29) were called the Egyptian Hallel, and early Jewish tradition believed Moses wrote them. 

During the temple period, this Hallel was read 18 days of the year, but on one night, the Passover. It was read in parts during the Passover:

* [Psalms 113–114](https://ref.ly/Ps113:1-Ps114:8) were read before the meal, before drinking the second cup.
* [Psalms 115–118](https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps118:29) were read after the last cup was filled.

This is probably the song that Jesus and his disciples sang at the Last Supper ([Matthew 26:30](https://ref.ly/Matt26:30); [Mark 14:26](https://ref.ly/Mark14:26)). This Hallel was also used for the feasts of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Tabernacles, and Dedication.

The Great Hallel was [Psalm 136](https://ref.ly/Ps136:1-Ps136:26) and sometimes [Psalms 120–136](https://ref.ly/Ps120:1-Ps136:26). [Psalms 146–148](https://ref.ly/Ps146:1-Ps148:14) were also a single Hallel. These were used during daily morning service of the synagogue.
