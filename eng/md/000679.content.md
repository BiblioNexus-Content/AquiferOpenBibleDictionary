## Baal-Zephon (id: 3949)

BAAL\-ZEPHON
============

An area near the Israelites’ camp just before they crossed the Red Sea ([Exodus 14:2, 9](https://ref.ly/Exod14:2,Exod14:9); [Numbers 33:7](https://ref.ly/Num33:7)). The exact location of Baal\-zephon is unknown but probably was in northeast Egypt. The name means “lord of the north,” and a shrine to a Semitic deity was probably located there. The god Baal\-zephon is mentioned in Ugaritic, Egyptian, and Phoenician writings as a sea and storm god.
