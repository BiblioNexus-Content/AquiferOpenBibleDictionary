## Rephan (id: 8005)

REPHAN
======

A pagan deity mentioned by Stephen in [Acts 7:43](https://ref.ly/Acts7:43) (King James Version "Remphan"; New American Standard Bible "Rompha"). Stephen quoted from the text of [Amos 5:26](https://ref.ly/Amos5:26) to show how the Israelites worshiped false gods during their time in the wilderness. 

Stephen was quoting from the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). The Septuagint translators understood the Hebrew word *kaiwan* to refer to the Assyrian god of Saturn, or possibly to the Egyptian Saturn god Repa.

Some scholars argue that [Amos 5:26](https://ref.ly/Amos5:26) does not name specific ancient gods at all, but is simply making a general reference to the false worship practiced by the Israelites in the wilderness.
