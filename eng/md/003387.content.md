## Korahite, Korathite (id: 6643)

KORAHITE, KORATHITE
===================

A member of Levi’s tribe, of the division of Kohath ([Exodus 6:18, 21](https://ref.ly/Exod6:18,Exod6:21)). 

Their ancestor, Izhar, was a member of the priestly family and was related to Moses and Aaron. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron. It ended with the deaths of many Korahites ([Numbers 16:31–35](https://ref.ly/Num16:31-Num16:35)). Only those who did not participate in the rebellion survived ([Numbers 16:11](https://ref.ly/Num16:11)). They settled around Hebron in areas set aside for the Levites ([Numbers 26:58](https://ref.ly/Num26:58)).

The Korahites were known as temple singers, according to [Psalms 42](https://ref.ly/Ps42:1-Ps42:11), [44–49](https://ref.ly/Ps44:1-Ps49:20), [84–85](https://ref.ly/Ps84:1-Ps85:13), and [87–88](https://ref.ly/Ps87:1-Ps88:18). David put them in charge of the musical service in the Lord's house after the ark of the covenant was brought to Jerusalem ([1 Chronicles 6:31–33](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:31-1Chr6:33)). They also acted as gatekeepers ([1 Chronicles 9:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:19); [26:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:19)). They baked cakes used in sacrifices ([1 Chronicles 9:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:31)). They are mentioned as singers in the celebration of Jehoshaphat's victory over Ammon and Moab ([2 Chronicles 20:19](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:19)).
