## Abiram (id: 3308)

ABIRAM
======

1. One of Eliab’s two sons. Abiram and his brother Dathan joined in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron. Moses caused the ground to split open beneath the two brothers and their families. They died in a massive earthquake ([Numbers 16:1](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:33)–[33](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:33)).
2. Hiel’s oldest son. He died early when his father rebuilt Jericho against God's wishes ([1 Kings 16:34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:34)). Joshua had prophesied about this event ([Joshua 6:26](https://ref.ly/Josh6:26)).
