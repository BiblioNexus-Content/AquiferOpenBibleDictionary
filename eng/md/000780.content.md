## Beautiful Gate (id: 4051)

BEAUTIFUL GATE
==============

A gate in Herod’s temple in Jerusalem. 

A man who was unable to walk was miraculously healed by Peter and John at the gate ([Acts 3:2, 10](https://ref.ly/Acts3:2,Acts3:10)). We do not know where this gate was, but it was probably the gate leading from the Court of the Gentiles into the Women’s Court. This was also called the Corinthian Gate (for its Corinthian bronze) by the Jewish historian Josephus. According to him, it measured 22\.9 meters (75 feet) high by 18\.3 meters (60 feet) wide. A burial inscription found on Mount Olivet says the gate was built by a Jewish man from Alexandria named Nicanor.
