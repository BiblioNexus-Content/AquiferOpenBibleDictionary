## Jezreel (Person) (id: 6377)

JEZREEL (Person)
================

1\. Descendant of Etam from the tribe of Judah ([1 Chr 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:3)). Another possible reading suggests that Jezreel was one of the founding fathers of the town of Etam. Due to numerous scribal alterations within the Hebrew text, it is difficult to discern the original intent of the author.

2\. Firstborn son of the prophet Hosea and his wife, Gomer. Jezreel’s name, meaning “God sows,” prefigured the outpouring of God’s wrath on the disobedient kingdom of Israel under Jehu ([Hos 1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Hos1:4-Hos1:5)) and ultimate restoration ([2:21–22](https://ref.ly/Hos2:21-Hos2:22)).
