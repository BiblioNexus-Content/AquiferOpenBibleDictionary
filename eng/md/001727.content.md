## Eleazar (id: 4980)

ELEAZAR
=======

1. The third of Aaron’s four sons ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23)). His name means "God has helped." He was consecrated as a priest along with his brothers and Aaron in the Sinai desert ([Exodus 28:1](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1); [Leviticus 8:2, 13](https://ref.ly/Lev8:2,Lev8:13)). After his brothers Nadab and Abihu were killed by God for offering "unholy fire,"([Leviticus 10:1](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7)[7](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:7)), Eleazar and Ithamar took leading roles as Aaron’s sons ([Numbers 3:1](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num3:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num3:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Num3:1-Num3:4)).

    Eleazar is described as “chief of the leaders of the Levites” ([Numbers 3:32](https://ref.ly/Num3:32)). He was responsible for overseeing the sanctuary and its vessels ([Numbers 4:16](https://ref.ly/Num4:16); [16:37](https://ref.ly/Num16:37-Num16:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Num16:37-Num16:39)[39](https://ref.ly/Num16:37-Num16:39); [19:3](https://ref.ly/Num19:3-Num19:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Num19:3-Num19:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Num19:3-Num19:4)). When Aaron died on Mount Hor, Moses installed Eleazar as the high priest ([Numbers 20:25](https://ref.ly/Num20:25-Num20:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Num20:25-Num20:28)[28](https://ref.ly/Num20:25-Num20:28); [Deuteronomy 10:6](https://ref.ly/Deut10:6)). From that point on, he became Moses’ assistant ([Numbers 26:1](https://ref.ly/Num26:1-Num26:3,Num26:63)[–](https://ref.ly/Num26:1-Num26:3)[3, 63](https://ref.ly/Num26:1-Num26:3,Num26:63); [27:2, 21](https://ref.ly/Num27:2,Num27:21)). Joshua was commissioned by Moses in the presence of Eleazar ([Numbers 27:18](https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Num27:18-Num27:23)). During the conquest of Canaan, Eleazar worked alongside Joshua as a leader. His role was to inquire of the Lord on Joshua's behalf, providing divine counsel ([Numbers 27:21](https://ref.ly/Num27:21)). Eleazar also participated in dividing the land among the tribes of Israel, both on the east and west banks of the Jordan River ([Numbers 34:17](https://ref.ly/Num34:17); [Joshua 14:1](https://ref.ly/Josh14:1); [17:4](https://ref.ly/Josh17:4); [19:51](https://ref.ly/Josh19:51); [21:1](https://ref.ly/Josh21:1)).

    Upon Eleazar's death, he was highly regarded and memorialized in the land of Ephraim ([Joshua 24:33](https://ref.ly/Josh24:33)). His son Phinehas became high priest after his death.

    Eleazar's descendants were given 16 divisions in the oversight of the priests, while Ithamar's descendants received eight ([1 Chronicles 24](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:1-1Chr24:31)). Notable priests like Zadok and Ezra traced their ancestry back to Eleazar ([1 Chronicles 6:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15,1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15)[15, 50](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15,1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15)[53](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3-1Chr6:15,1Chr6:50-1Chr6:53); [24:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3); [Ezra 7:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1-Ezra7:5)).

    In later times, during King Solomon's reign, the priests descended from Zadok replaced Abiathar, who was from Ithamar's line ([1 Kings 2:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27,1Kgs2:35)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27)[27, 35](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:26-1Kgs2:27,1Kgs2:35)). According to Ezekiel's vision of an ideal temple, only the descendants of Eleazar would be permitted to serve as priests ([Ezekiel 44:15](https://ref.ly/Ezek44:15)).

2. Abinadab’s son. He was put in charge of caring for the ark by the people of Kiriath\-jearim, when it was brought from Beth\-shemesh and placed in the “house of Abinadab on the hill” ([1 Samuel 7:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam7:1)).
3. Dodo’s son, one of the three mighty men whose feats against the Philistines made him famous ([2 Samuel 23:9](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:9); [1 Chronicles 11:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:12)).
4. A Merarite Levite, son of Mahli. Eleazar died without sons, so his daughters were married to their first cousins ([1 Chronicles 23:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:21-1Chr23:22)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:21-1Chr23:22)[22](https://ref.ly/1Chr23:21-1Chr23:22); [24:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:28)).
5. A priest who descended from Phinehas. This Eleazar helped record the items in the temple treasure after returning from the exile in Babylon with Ezra ([Ezra 8:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33)).
6. Parosh’s son, listed with others who divorced their non\-Jewish wives in the reform under Ezra ([Ezra 10:25](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:25)).
7. A priest who was present at the dedication of the rebuilt walls of Jerusalem following the exile in Babylon ([Nehemiah 12:42](https://ref.ly/Neh12:42)).
8. A person in the family list of Joseph, husband of Mary ([Matthew 1:15](https://ref.ly/Matt1:15)).
