## Arnon (id: 3756)

ARNON
=====

A river in the area east of the Jordan River. The Arnon is known today as Wadi el\-Mojib. The river runs from east to west through a canyon with walls 457 meters (1,500 feet) high into the Dead Sea. 

At the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the gorge served as a natural border between Moab to the south and the Ammonite kingdoms to the north ([Numbers 21:13–15](https://ref.ly/Num21:13-Num21:15)). 

After the division of the land under Joshua, the river Arnon became the southern boundary of Reuben’s territory ([Deuteronomy 3:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Deut3:12,Deut3:16); [Joshua 13:16](https://ref.ly/Josh13:16)).
