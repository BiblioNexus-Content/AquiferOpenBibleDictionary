## Nebo (Person) (id: 7330)

NEBO (Person)
=============

Forefather of 52 descendants who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the exile ([Ezr 2:29](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:29); [Neh 7:33](https://ref.ly/Neh7:33)), 7 of whom were encouraged by Ezra to divorce their foreign wives ([Ezr 10:43](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:43)). Some suggest that Nebo refers to a town in Benjamin’s tribe from which some inhabitants went into exile to Babylon.
