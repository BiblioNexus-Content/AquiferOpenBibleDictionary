## Raisin Cake (id: 7915)

RAISIN CAKE
===========

A special food of ancient people ([Isaiah 16:7](https://ref.ly/Isa16:7)). The cakes did not spoil. This made them useful for soldiers and travelers ([2 Samuel 6:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:19)). They were used as offerings to idols ([Hosea 3:1](https://ref.ly/Hos3:1)). Sometimes they were served as aphrodisiacs to increase sexual desire ([Song of Solomon 2:5](https://ref.ly/Song2:5)).
