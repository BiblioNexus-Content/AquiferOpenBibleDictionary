## Lettuce (id: 718560)

Lettuce
=======

A leafy green vegetable that people commonly eat in salads. While not specifically named in the Bible, many scholars believe that lettuce (*Lactuca sativa*) may have been one of the "bitter herbs" mentioned in [Exodus 12:8](https://ref.ly/Exod12:8) and [Numbers 9:11](https://ref.ly/Num9:11). These bitter herbs were to be eaten with the Passover meal as a reminder of the Israelites’ suffering in Egypt.
