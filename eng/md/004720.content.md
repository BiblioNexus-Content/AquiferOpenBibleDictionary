## Rehob (Place) (id: 7985)

REHOB (Place)
=============

1. The farthest northern area explored by the Israelite spies before they entered Canaan ([Numbers 13:21](https://ref.ly/Num13:21)). This place matches the location of Beth\-rehob ([Judges 18:28](https://ref.ly/Judg18:28)). Rehob is also mentioned along with Zobah and Maacah as enemies who fought against King David during the war with the Ammonites ([2 Samuel 10:6–8](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6-2Sam10:8)).
2. Two cities that belonged to the tribe of Asher ([Joshua 19:28–30](https://ref.ly/Josh19:28-Josh19:30)). One of these cities was given to the Levites from the family of Gershon ([Joshua 21:31](https://ref.ly/Josh21:31)). It became a city of refuge ([1 Chronicles 6:75](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:75)). The other city remained under the control of the Canaanites ([Judges 1:31](https://ref.ly/Judg1:31)). Some scholars think these references might actually be talking about the same city.
