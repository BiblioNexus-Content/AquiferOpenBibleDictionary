## Pastor (id: 7603)

PASTOR
======

A word literally meaning “shepherd.” It is used in both the Old Testament and New Testament in a figurative sense for rulers and leaders. Of the 12 times the word is used in the New Testament as a metaphor for “leader,” it is translated as “pastor” only in [Ephesians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11) (King James Version, American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version, New International Version, Today's English Version, New Living Translation).

Pastors and teachers together formed a group that complemented the work of apostles, prophets, and evangelists. The titles “bishop” and “elder” refer to the same office in the New Testament (compare [Acts 20:17, 28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:17,Acts20:28); [Titus 1:5–7](https://ref.ly/Titus1:5-Titus1:7)). “Pastor” seems to have the same meaning as "bishop" and "elder," as shown by Jesus being referred to as “the Shepherd and Bishop \[or Overseer] of your souls” ([1 Peter 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:25), King James Version). 

The verb “to shepherd” is used to describe the work of local church leaders ([John 21:16](https://ref.ly/John21:16); [Acts 20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28); [1 Peter 5:2](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:2)). Often the congregation is called a flock. It is the pastor’s responsibility to build up the body of Christ. The pastor builds up the body of Christ by watching over the congregation ([Acts 20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28); [Hebrews 13:7](https://ref.ly/Heb13:7)) and opposing false teaching ([Acts 20:29–30](https://ref.ly/Acts20:29-Acts20:30)). More detailed information regarding the duties and responsibilities of pastors is found in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus, which have come to be called the Pastoral Letters.
