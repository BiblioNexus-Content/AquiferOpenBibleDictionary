## Fish Gate (id: 5270)

FISH GATE
=========

Gate probably located in the north wall of the city of Jerusalem. The Fish Gate was built in David’s time and later formed part of Manasseh’s fortifications ([2 Chr 33:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:14)). After the Babylonian exile, it was restored under Nehemiah ([Neh 3:3](https://ref.ly/Neh3:3); [12:39](https://ref.ly/Neh12:39)); it is mentioned along with the Mishneh or Second Quarter ([Zep 1:10](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:10)). The gate was probably so named either because fish were brought into the city from the north, or because it was located near the city’s fish market.
