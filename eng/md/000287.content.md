## Ambassador (id: 3548)

AMBASSADOR
==========

A messenger or envoy officially representing a higher authority. In the Old Testament, an ambassador was someone sent to speak for a king or ruler. This person would go on short trips to share messages or make agreements. They acted as the official voice of the leader who sent them. Examples include:

* the envoys of Pharaoh ([Isaiah 30:4](https://ref.ly/Isa30:4)),
* the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon ([2 Chronicles 32:31](https://ref.ly/2Chr32:31)), and
* messengers of Neco, king of Egypt ([2 Chronicles 35:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:21)).

In the letters of Paul, the apostle called himself an ambassador for Christ because he had an apostolic mission to share the gospel of Christ with the gentiles ([2 Corinthians 5:20](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:20); [Ephesians 6:20](https://ref.ly/Eph6:20)).
