## Patience (id: 7608)

PATIENCE
========

Patience is the ability to endure much hardship or mistreatment. It is not to lose your temper, get irritated, or seek revenge. It includes: 

1. The strength to endure pain without complaining
2. The ability to hold back when severely provoked
3. The self\-control to avoid rash actions in adversity

In Hebrew, the common expression for patience is related to the verb "to be long," meaning being slow to get angry or upset. In Greek, two different words were translated as "patience" in the King James Version of the Bible: 

1. One word suggests "remaining firm under" tests and trials and is better translated as "endurance" or "steadfastness."
2. The other Greek word is similar to the Hebrew meaning. It refers to patience as "long\-spiritedness" or staying calm when provoked to anger.

The greatest example of patience in the Bible is God himself. Many passages describe God, along with other gracious attributes, as "slow to anger." Despite Israel's repeated rebellions, God is shown as forgiving. He is gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, and full of lovingkindness ([Nehemiah 9:17](https://ref.ly/Neh9:17)). The psalmist says, "But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness" ([Psalm 86:15](https://ref.ly/Ps86:15); see also [Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6); [Numbers 14:18](https://ref.ly/Num14:18); [Psalms 103:8](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8); [Joel 2:13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13); [Jonah 4:2](https://ref.ly/Jonah4:2)). The Old Testament also praises the virtue of a patient spirit, especially in Proverbs ([Proverbs 14:29](https://ref.ly/Prov14:29); [15:18](https://ref.ly/Prov15:18); [16:32](https://ref.ly/Prov16:32); [25:15](https://ref.ly/Prov25:15); see also [Ecclesiastes 7:8](https://ref.ly/Eccl7:8)).

The New Testament also emphasizes the Lord's patience. It is God's kindness, forbearance, and patience that lead people to repentance ([Romans 2:4](https://ref.ly/Rom2:4)). God was patient in delaying the Flood during Noah's time. It was while the ark was being built. This gave people more time to repent ([1 Peter 3:20](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:20)). Perhaps the most significant New Testament reference to God's patience is in [2 Peter 3:9](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:9). Peter explains that the delay in Christ's return is not due to God's slowness. It is because of his patience that he does not want anyone to perish. Paul also mentions Jesus Christ's patience. He says that Christ showed perfect patience in his dealings with him ([1 Timothy 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:16)).

Patience, which is a characteristic of God and Jesus Christ, should also be seen in every Christian. Paul prayed for the Colossians, asking that they would show this quality ([Colossians 1:11](https://ref.ly/Col1:11)). Patience is: 

* One of the fruits of the Spirit ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22))
* A characteristic of love ([1 Corinthians 13:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4))
* A virtue ([Colossians 3:12](https://ref.ly/Col3:12); see also [2 Timothy 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:10))

Christians are also urged to be patient ([1 Thessalonians 5:14](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:14)). If we are not, we may be treated like the servant in one of Jesus's parables. This servant begged his master, to whom he owed a huge debt, for patience, promising to repay everything. The master was patient and forgave all the debt. But, he found the servant refused to show the same patience to a fellow servant who owed him a small amount. ([Matthew 18:26–29](https://ref.ly/Matt18:26-Matt18:29))

In some contexts, "patience" also means waiting a long time with hope and expectation. For example, a farmer waits patiently for the crops to grow ([James 5:7b](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7)). Abraham waited for God to give him the land of Canaan. He died without seeing the promise fulfilled, but he still believed ([Hebrews 6:15](https://ref.ly/Heb6:15); [11:39](https://ref.ly/Heb11:39)). Finally, all Christians are commanded to be patient until the Lord's return ([James 5:7a](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7)).
