## Bethabara (id: 4150)

BETHABARA
=========

A village where messengers from the Pharisees questioned John the Baptist ([John 1:28](https://ref.ly/John1:28), King James Version). 

Modern translations use “Bethany” instead of Bethabara to follow a better collection of manuscript evidence. John called it Bethany “beyond the Jordan” to distinguish it from the Bethany near Jerusalem. 

*See* Bethany \#2.
