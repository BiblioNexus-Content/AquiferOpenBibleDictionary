SHETHAR\-BOZENAI, SHETHAR\-BOZNAI\*
===================================

Persian official in a province west of the Euphrates River, who joined with Tattenai and his colleagues in writing a letter to Darius Hystaspeis, king of Persia, protesting the rebuilding of the temple and walls of Jerusalem under Zerubbabel ([Ezr 5:3, 6](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:3,Ezra5:6)). Darius warned them not to interfere with Zerubbabel’s work, and they obeyed him ([Ezr 6:6, 13](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:6,Ezra6:13)).
