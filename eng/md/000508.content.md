## Arza (id: 3774)

ARZA
====

Arza was in charge of the palace in Tirzah, a city in the northern kingdom of Israel. He worked for King Elah, who ruled over the northern part of Israel. One day, King Elah was drinking alcohol and became drunk in Arza's house. While the king was there, a man named Zimri killed him. Zimri then declared himself king ([1 Kings 16:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:9-1Kgs16:10)).
