## Carpus (id: 4437)

CARPUS
======

A man with whom the apostle Paul left his cloak at the city of Troas in Asia Minor. Paul instructed his disciple Timothy to bring the cloak when he visited him in prison ([2 Timothy 4:13](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:13)). It is possible that Carpus was one of the converts of Paul. According to tradition, Carpus became the bishop of Berytus (Beirut) in Thrace.
