## Machir (id: 6835)

MACHIR
======

1. A grandson of the patriarch Joseph. He was the firstborn son of Manasseh through his Aramean concubine ([Genesis 50:23](https://ref.ly/Gen50:23); [1 Chronicles 7:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:14)). Machir was the father of Gilead and the founder of the Machirite clan ([Numbers 26:29](https://ref.ly/Num26:29)). His descendants defeated the Amorites who lived in the land of Gilead east of the Jordan River during the time of Moses ([Numbers 32:39](https://ref.ly/Num32:39)). Later, Joshua assigned them this land along with Bashan for an inheritance ([Deuteronomy 3:15](https://ref.ly/Deut3:15); [Joshua 17:1–3](https://ref.ly/Josh17:1-Josh17:3)). In [Judges 5:14](https://ref.ly/Judg5:14), the whole tribe of Manasseh is called by this name.
2. A son of Ammiel who lived in Lo\-debar. Lo\-debar was a town east of the Jordan River. Machir provided shelter for Mephibosheth ([2 Samuel 9:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Sam9:4-2Sam9:5)). Later, Machir, together with Shobi and Barzillai, brought supplies for David and his people when David was running away from his son Absalom ([2 Samuel 17:27](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:27)).
