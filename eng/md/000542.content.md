## Ashtaroth, Ashterathite (id: 3809)

ASHTAROTH, ASHTERATHITE
=======================

A town of Bashan, which was the home of King Og, as well as Edrei ([Deuteronomy 1:4](https://ref.ly/Deut1:4); [Joshua 9:10](https://ref.ly/Josh9:10); [12:4](https://ref.ly/Josh12:4); [13:12, 31](https://ref.ly/Josh13:12,Josh13:31)). 

Ashtaroth is the plural form of Ashtoreth, the name of a Canaanite fertility goddess who was worshiped there. After Og was defeated by the Israelites ([Deuteronomy 3:1](https://ref.ly/Deut3:1-Deut3:11)–[11](https://ref.ly/Deut3:1-Deut3:11)), Moses gave Ashtaroth to the half\-tribe of Manasseh ([Joshua 13:12, 31](https://ref.ly/Josh13:12,Josh13:31); [Deuteronomy 3:13](https://ref.ly/Deut3:13)). Later, it became a Levitical city inhabited by the Gershonites ([1 Chronicles 6:71](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:71)). 

Ashteroth\-karnaim ([Genesis 14:5](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5)) is probably the same town as Ashtaroth. Its location is usually identified as modern\-day Tell Ashtarah, 21 miles or 34 kilometers east of the Sea of Galilee. In [1 Chronicles 11:44,](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:44) one of David’s mighty men, Uzzia, is called an Ashterathite.
