EN\-SHEMESH
===========

Place mentioned only in [Joshua 15:7](https://ref.ly/Josh15:7) and [18:17](https://ref.ly/Josh18:17) as a boundary marker between Judah’s northern border and Benjamin’s southern border. The usual identification is with ’Ain el\-Hod, about three miles (4\.8 kilometers) east of Jerusalem on the road to Jericho. On the basis of a tradition that the apostles drank there, it is sometimes referred to as the Spring of the Apostles.
