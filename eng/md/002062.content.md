## Fuller’s Field (id: 5316)

FULLER’S FIELD
==============

Fuller’s Field was a place outside Jerusalem. It was near a spring or pool of water. A raised walkway or water channel (called an aqueduct) led to it ([2 Kings 18:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:17); [Isaiah 7:3](https://ref.ly/Isa7:3); [36:2](https://ref.ly/Isa36:2)). Many scholars think it was close to En\-rogel, a spring also called “spring of the fuller.” A fuller was someone who cleaned and prepared cloth, especially wool.

En\-rogel was in the Kidron Valley, south of Jerusalem. In Bible times, it marked the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin ([Joshua 15:7](https://ref.ly/Josh15:7); [18:16](https://ref.ly/Josh18:16)). When Absalom rebelled against King David, David ran away from Jerusalem. Two of his helpers stayed at En\-rogel to gather news about the rebellion ([2 Samuel 17:17](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:17)).

En\-rogel is often identified with a deep well called Bir Attub, or “Job’s Well.” This well reaches down into the rock and brings up water after it rains.
