## Carpenter (id: 4436)

CARPENTER
=========

One who worked with wood, building the framework of houses, the roofing, windows, and doors. Often small structures like houses were built by the owner. Temples and palaces required skilled workers. For these larger structures, carpenters worked alongside stonemasons, skilled workers who knew how to cut and prepare stone for building ([2 Kings 12:11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:11); [22:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:6); [1 Chronicles 14:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:1); [22:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:15); [2 Chronicles 24:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr24:12); [34:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:11); [Ezra 3:7](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:7)). Carpentry is rarely referred to in the New Testament, though it was the profession of Jesus and his father Joseph ([Matthew 13:55](https://ref.ly/Matt13:55); [Mark 6:3](https://ref.ly/Mark6:3)).
