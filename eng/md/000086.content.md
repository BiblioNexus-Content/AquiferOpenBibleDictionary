## Achshaph (id: 3345)

ACHSHAPH
========

A Canaanite royal city in Joshua’s time. Its king joined an alliance with Jabin, king of Hazor, against Israel in a battle at Merom ([Joshua 11:1](https://ref.ly/Josh11:1)). After Israel’s victory, Achshaph’s king was one of 31 Canaanite kings defeated by Joshua ([Joshua 12:20](https://ref.ly/Josh12:20)). This fulfilled God’s promise to give kings to Israel ([Deuteronomy 7:24](https://ref.ly/Deut7:24)). The city of Achshaph was given to the tribe of Asher when the Israelites were dividing up the land of Canaan ([Joshua 19:25](https://ref.ly/Josh19:25)).
