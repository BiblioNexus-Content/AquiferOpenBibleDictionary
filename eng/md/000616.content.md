## Avenger of Blood (id: 3884)

AVENGER OF BLOOD
================

A person who chased and eventually executed the murderer of a close relative ([Numbers 35](https://ref.ly/Num35:1-Num35:34)). This “redeemer“ was expected to act in cases of intentional murder but not accidental manslaughter. Someone guilty of manslaughter could seek asylum in one of six designated cities ([Numbers 35:11](https://ref.ly/Num35:11)) to make sure that proper legal processes could take place. The role of the avenger of blood is mentioned in stories about:

* Gideon ([Judges 8:18](https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21)[21](https://ref.ly/Judg8:18-Judg8:21))
* Joab ([2 Samuel 3:27, 30](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:27,2Sam3:30))
* The Gibeonites ([2 Samuel 21](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1-2Sam21:22))
* Amaziah ([2 Kings 14:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6)[6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:5-2Kgs14:6))

During the monarchy, the king could stop the avenger ([2 Samuel 14:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11)[–](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11)[11](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:8-2Sam14:11)).

This custom was based on God's command that a life should be taken for a life in cases of intentional homicide ([Genesis 9:6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:6)). Unfortunately, the goal of the law—to highlight the importance of human life—has sometimes been misunderstood, leading to blood feuds and the destruction of entire families in some societies.
