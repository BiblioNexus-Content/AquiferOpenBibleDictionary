## Firstborn (id: 5264)

FIRSTBORN
=========

The oldest son or daughter in a family ([Genesis 22:21](https://ref.ly/Gen22:21); [29:26](https://ref.ly/Gen29:26)). 

Israel was called God’s firstborn because of that nation’s miraculous beginning and special rescue from Egypt ([Genesis 17:5, 15](https://ref.ly/Gen17:5,Gen17:15-Gen17:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen17:5)[16](https://ref.ly/Gen17:5,Gen17:15-Gen17:16); [Exodus 4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22)). As God’s firstborn, Israel had a special status over all other nations. Gentiles (non\-Jewish people) were “blessed” only in relation to their kindness to Israel ([Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3); [Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6); [Deuteronomy 4:5](https://ref.ly/Deut4:5-Deut4:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut4:5-Deut4:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Deut4:5-Deut4:8)). The prophet Isaiah foresaw a day when Israel would have a double portion of inheritance ([Isaiah 61:7](https://ref.ly/Isa61:7)). Thus, being firstborn implies priority or superiority, as well as an inheritance.

The expression “firstborn of the poor” in [Isaiah 14:30](https://ref.ly/Isa14:30) means one who is the most poor, the poorest of the poor. The expression “firstborn of death” in [Job 18:13](https://ref.ly/Job18:13) suggests that Job’s disease would kill him.

Because God saved Israel’s firstborn sons from death in Egypt, he expected that all future firstborn sons be set apart for his service ([Exodus 11:4](https://ref.ly/Exod11:4-Exod11:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod11:4-Exod11:7)[7](https://ref.ly/Exod11:4-Exod11:7); [13:12](https://ref.ly/Exod13:12)). The first male child was a representative of the entire offspring ([Genesis 49:3](https://ref.ly/Gen49:3); [Exodus 22:29](https://ref.ly/Exod22:29); [Numbers 3:13](https://ref.ly/Num3:13)). God commanded that the firstborn of all animals used for offerings should be set apart for him ([Exodus 13:2, 15](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2,Exod13:15)).

Firstborn and Redemption
------------------------

Each tribe was to redeem their firstborn, except Levi's, by paying a sum not to exceed five shekels ([Numbers 18:15](https://ref.ly/Num18:15-Num18:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Num18:15-Num18:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Num18:15-Num18:16)). Redemption implied a prior bondage. It was to remind Israel of their liberation from Egypt ([Exodus 13:2](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2-Exod13:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2-Exod13:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Exod13:2-Exod13:8)).

The firstborn of ritually clean animals was devoted to the Lord. It was brought to the tabernacle (or later, the temple) within a year from the eighth day after birth. This animal was then sacrificed and its blood sprinkled on the altar. The meat of the sacrificed animal was for the priests ([Exodus 13:13](https://ref.ly/Exod13:13); [22:30](https://ref.ly/Exod22:30); compare [Numbers 18:17](https://ref.ly/Num18:17)). The firstborn of unclean animals could be redeemed with an addition of one\-fifth of the value as determined by the priest. If not redeemed, these animals were sold, exchanged, or destroyed by the priests ([Leviticus 27:27](https://ref.ly/Lev27:27)). The colt of an ass was to be redeemed with a lamb ([Exodus 13:13](https://ref.ly/Exod13:13)). If not redeemed, it was to be killed. Meat from unclean animals was not eaten.

Firstborn and Birthright
------------------------

The firstborn acted as the priest of the family if the father was gone or dead. Esau and Reuben are both examples ([Genesis 27:19, 32](https://ref.ly/Gen27:19,Gen27:32); [1 Chronicles 5:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)[2](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:1-1Chr5:2)). This position of the firstborn ended when the priesthood was committed to Levi’s tribe ([Numbers 3:12](https://ref.ly/Num3:12-Num3:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Num3:12-Num3:13)[13](https://ref.ly/Num3:12-Num3:13)). All the firstborns of later generations had to be redeemed. The redemption money became part of the Levites’ yearly income ([Numbers 8:17](https://ref.ly/Num8:17); [18:16](https://ref.ly/Num18:16)).

A double portion of the family inheritance was the right of the firstborn. This protected the firstborn when a man had more than one wife. The son of a favorite wife could not take the place of the first son born of the household ([Deuteronomy 21:17](https://ref.ly/Deut21:17)).

The title “firstborn” is applied to Jesus ([Luke 2:7](https://ref.ly/Luke2:7); [Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [Colossians 1:15, 18](https://ref.ly/Col1:15,Col1:18); [Hebrews 1:6](https://ref.ly/Heb1:6); [Revelation 1:5](https://ref.ly/Rev1:5)). It stresses Jesus's priority over all because he was the first to rise from the dead. As firstborn, Jesus's is: 

* Heir of all things ([Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2))
* The head of the church ([Ephesians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:20-Eph1:23); [Colossians 1:18, 24](https://ref.ly/Col1:18,Col1:24); [Hebrews 2:10](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10-Heb2:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10-Heb2:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Heb2:10-Heb2:12))
