## Elim (id: 5014)

ELIM
====

A place where the Israelites camped after they passed through the Red Sea ([Exodus 15:27](https://ref.ly/Exod15:27); [16:1](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1)). Elim was between Marah and the desert of Sin. It had 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees ([Numbers 33:9–10](https://ref.ly/Num33:9-Num33:10)).

Most scholars identify Elim with Wadi Gharandel, which is 101\.4 kilometers (63 miles) from Suez. At this wadi, the vegetation consists of palm trees, tamarisks, and acacias. But if Mount Sinai is located in Arabia, Elim would be much closer to the Gulf of Aqaba.
