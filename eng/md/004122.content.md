## New Creation, New Creature (id: 7380)

NEW CREATION, NEW CREATURE
==========================

The message of redemption that unfolds through the Old and New Testaments. Christ will fulfill it at his second coming.

The Bible says God is the Creator of heaven and earth. He controls everything (see [Genesis 1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31); [Psalms 33:6–11](https://ref.ly/Ps33:6-Ps33:11); [104](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35); [Matthew 6:25–32](https://ref.ly/Matt6:25-Matt6:32)). Humans are described as beings made in God's image ([Genesis 1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:25)). Understanding God as Creator is key to understanding the Bible's message of salvation. Human sin is serious. It is due to people who "worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator" ([Romans 1:25](https://ref.ly/Rom1:25)). God is our Redeemer because he is our Creator. He saves his rebellious creatures. They suffer, with all creation, under a curse of futility and decay ([Genesis 3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:18); [Romans 8:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rom8:20-Rom8:21)).

New Creation in the Old Testament
---------------------------------

The book of Isaiah, especially chapters [40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24), links creation and salvation. Here, the prophet talks about God's ultimate redemption for Israel. This future salvation often highlights God as the Creator of heaven, earth, and Israel (see [Isaiah 40:12–31](https://ref.ly/Isa40:12-Isa40:31); [44:24](https://ref.ly/Isa44:24); [45:18](https://ref.ly/Isa45:18); [48:13](https://ref.ly/Isa48:13); [51:16](https://ref.ly/Isa51:16); [64:8](https://ref.ly/Isa64:8)).

Isaiah speaks of "new heavens and a new earth" ([Isaiah 65:17](https://ref.ly/Isa65:17); [66:22](https://ref.ly/Isa66:22)). This idea of a new creation shows that the salvation God promises is for everyone, not just Israel. God’s work of recreation and restoration at the end connects to his work of creation in the beginning ([Isaiah 48:12](https://ref.ly/Isa48:12)). What God will do at the end for all things is as significant as what he did when he created everything from nothing. This new creation order will lead to eternal happiness for the faithful. New Testament writers continue to develop these themes.

New Creation and Christ
-----------------------

The New Testament strongly connects creation and redemption. Various writers link Christ's saving work to his role in creation ([John 1:3](https://ref.ly/John1:3); [Colossians 1:15–18](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:18); [Hebrews 1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2-Heb1:3); [Revelation 3:14](https://ref.ly/Rev3:14)). They highlight this link. They mention what Christ did "when the time had fully come" ([Galatians 4:4](https://ref.ly/Gal4:4); [Ephesians 1:10](https://ref.ly/Eph1:10) and "in these last days" ([Hebrews 1:2](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2)). This work is tied to his actions at the beginning. Christ's work of redemption is seen as a new creation.

This link between new creation and Christ's work is clear. Paul calls Christ the "last Adam" and "second man" ([1 Corinthians 15:45–47](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:45-1Cor15:47); compare verse [22](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22); [Romans 5:14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14)). This description is closely related to the title "Son of Man," which Jesus used for himself. Paul uses the term "last Adam" to highlight the contrast between Adam and Christ ([Romans 1](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom1:32); [1 Corinthians 15](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58)). Adam brought sin and death because he was disobedient. But Christ was obedient and so brought righteousness. This leads to justification and life.

Paul explains the full scope of this Adam\-Christ contrast in [1 Corinthians 15:42–49](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:42-1Cor15:49). He compares the believer's weak, mortal body with the glorious, powerful one that they will receive at the resurrection. He summarizes this contrast by saying that one body is "natural," and the other is "spiritual." Adam and Christ represent these two kinds of bodies—the natural and the spiritual. But Paul also presents Adam and Christ as whole persons, representing others and leading two different orders of life. Adam, the first man, is the head of the natural world. It is now corrupt and mortal due to sin ([Romans 5:12–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:19)). Christ, the second and last Adam, is the representative head of the spiritual, heavenly order characterized by life, power, and glory. The passage contrasts two world orders: the original creation and its fulfillment in a new creation. Each began with an Adam.

Two more points are important for understanding the new creation message in Paul’s writings and the rest of the New Testament. 

1. Christ's resurrection forms the foundation of the believer's resurrection. As the last Adam, he became a life\-giving Spirit through his resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:45](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:45)). The focus is on the unity between Christ’s resurrection and that of believers (compare with [1 Corinthians 15:12–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12-1Cor15:20); [Colossians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18)). According to the New Testament, the new creation is a present reality that started with Christ's resurrection.
2. [1 Corinthians 15:45](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:45) shows the unity of the risen Christ and the Holy Spirit in giving life. It says the last Adam became a life\-giving Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the power behind the new creation (see [Hebrews 6:5](https://ref.ly/Heb6:5)). Wherever the Spirit works as the gift of the glorified Christ, the new creation is present.

The new creation fulfills what the Old Testament promised and anticipated. It has already begun through the work of Christ (the last Adam), especially through his death and resurrection. It will be completed upon his return. Meanwhile, we live in a time where the two creations coexist—the new has started, while the old continues to fade away ([1 Corinthians 7:31](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:31)). The concept of new creation ties in with God's kingdom, a theme central to Jesus's teachings in the Synoptic Gospels. The kingdom, tied to Jesus's work, is both present ([Matthew 12:28](https://ref.ly/Matt12:28); [13:11, 16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt13:11)) and future ([Matthew 8:11](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11); [25:34](https://ref.ly/Matt25:34)). Judaism, Jesus, and the early church (see [Matthew 12:32](https://ref.ly/Matt12:32); [Ephesians 1:21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:21)) spoke of two ages: this age and the "age to come." They viewed the "age to come" as the new creation. The term "new creation" signifies a complete transformation. It suggests that redemption means renewing everything ([Revelation 21:5](https://ref.ly/Rev21:5)).

**New Creation and the Church**

In the New Testament, believers unite with Christ and enjoy his salvation. Since Christ died and rose again, joining him means becoming part of a new creation ([2 Corinthians 5:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:15)). This new creation, seen in the context of reconciliation, is both personal and cosmic ([2 Corinthians 5:17–19](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17-2Cor5:19)).

In the only other New Testament occurrence of the expression "new creation" is in [Galatians 6:15](https://ref.ly/Gal6:15), the context is cosmic and personal. Believers united with Christ in his crucifixion now belong to a new creation. Here, distinctions like circumcision are irrelevant. The new creation is against the world, and the believer has been crucified with Christ ([Galatians 6:14](https://ref.ly/Gal6:14); compare [Colossians 2:20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20)). “Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come!” ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17)).

Resurrection is not only a future hope for believers but a present reality; they have already been raised with Christ ([Ephesians 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/Eph2:5-Eph2:6); compare [Colossians 2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Col2:12-Col2:13); [3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1)). Believers are “created in Christ Jesus to do good works” ([Ephesians 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10)). The church is the new covenant reality, the "new man," made up of both Jews and Gentiles ([Ephesians 2:15](https://ref.ly/Eph2:15)). The Holy Spirit renews its members ([2 Corinthians 4:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:16)). They start to reflect Christ's image ([2 Corinthians 3:18](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:18); [4:4–6](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4-2Cor4:6); compare [Romans 8:29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:29); [Ephesians 4:24](https://ref.ly/Eph4:24); [Colossians 3:10](https://ref.ly/Col3:10)). This process will finish at Christ's return ([1 Corinthians 15:49](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:49)). Christ's image takes shape in believers completely. New Testament ethics stem from this new creation. Believers are urged to live according to their new identity in Christ ([Romans 12:2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:2); [Colossians 2:20](https://ref.ly/Col2:20)).

**The Future of the New Creation**

While the new creation is a present reality, it is also a future hope. Believers live "by faith, not by sight" ([2 Corinthians 5:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:7)). They look forward to Christ's return and to Isaiah's prophecy of "a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells" ([2 Peter 3:13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13); [Revelation 21:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:4). In this new creation, sin and its effects will be no more.

This hope raises questions about the link between the final order and the original creation. [2 Peter 3:10–12](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10-2Pet3:12) and [Revelation 21](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:27) and [22](https://ref.ly/Rev22:1-Rev22:21) describe destruction by fire. They suggest a complete end, as there is no sun, moon, or night (see [Revelation 6:12–14](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12-Rev6:14)). But, some interpret these as figurative. Natural and spiritual bodies differ before and after resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:44](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:44)). But they remain connected. The body, now decayed and weak, is buried in dishonor. It will rise, incorruptible, glorious, and powerful. The same applies to creation. All creation's eager longing and groaning is not for destruction. It is for freedom from decay. It aims to share in the glory of God's children, revealed in the resurrection ([Romans 8:19–23](https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:23)). The new creation is not just a return to the past. It is a renewal, the peak of God's plans. It was realized through Christ's redemption, despite human sin and its effects.
