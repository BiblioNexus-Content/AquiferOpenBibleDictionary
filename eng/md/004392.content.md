## Penuel (Place) (id: 7649)

PENUEL (Place)
==============

A name given to the place near the Jabbok River where the patriarch Jacob wrestled all night with God ([Genesis 32:31](https://ref.ly/Gen32:31)). Another name is, “Peniel” (verse [30](https://ref.ly/Gen32:30)). 

Gideon destroyed the tower of Penuel when he was a leader during the time of the judges. He killed the men of the city for refusing to join him in war against the Midianites ([Judges 8:8–9, 17](https://ref.ly/Judg8:8-Judg8:9,Judg8:17)). Later, King Jeroboam rebuilt the town ([1 Kings 12:25](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:25)). It was near Succoth, east of the Jordan River, though its exact location remains uncertain.
