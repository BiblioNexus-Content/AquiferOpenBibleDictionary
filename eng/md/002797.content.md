## Irijah (id: 6047)

IRIJAH
======

A guard from the tribe of Benjamin who arrested the prophet Jeremiah when he was leaving Jerusalem to inspect property he had the right to buy ([Jeremiah 32:6–7](https://ref.ly/Jer32:6-Jer32:7)). Irijah accused Jeremiah of trying to join the Babylonian army. Because of this false charge, the officials had Jeremiah beaten and put in prison ([37:13–14](https://ref.ly/Jer37:13-Jer37:14)).
