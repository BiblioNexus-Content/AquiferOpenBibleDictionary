## Abdon (Place) (id: 3274)

ABDON (Place)
=============

One of four cities that the Levites received from Asher’s territory after the conquest of Canaan, the land God promised to Abraham's family ([Joshua 21:30](https://ref.ly/Josh21:30); [1 Chronicles 6:74](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:74)). Abdon is probably the same as Ebron ([Joshua 19:28](https://ref.ly/Josh19:28)). Today, Abdon is called Khirbet ’Abdeh.
