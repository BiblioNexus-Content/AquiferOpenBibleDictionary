## Feast of Booths (id: 4305)

FEAST OF BOOTHS
===============

The Feast of Booths is one of the three great festivals of Israel. This festival celebrated the end of the farming year when all crops had been harvested. During this festival, the Jewish people built temporary shelters called "booths" to remember how God saved them from Egypt ([Leviticus 23:39–43](https://ref.ly/Lev23:39-Lev23:43)). These booths (or huts) were similar to the temporary shelters the Israelites lived in during their journey through the wilderness after leaving Egypt.
