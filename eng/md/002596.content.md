## High Priest (id: 7814)

HIGH PRIEST
===========

The most important religious leader in ancient Israel. God chose Aaron, Moses' brother, to be the first high priest ([Exodus 28:1–3](https://ref.ly/Exod28:1-Exod28:3)). Only one person could be high priest at a time. This position was usually passed down within Aaron's family.

The high priest had special duties that other priests could not do. His most important task happened once a year on the Day of Atonement. The high priest would enter the most holy part of the temple to ask God's forgiveness for all the people ([Leviticus 16:1–19](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:19)).

The high priest wore special clothes that showed his important role. These included beautiful robes and a breastplate with twelve precious stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel ([Exodus 28:12–15](https://ref.ly/Exod28:12-Exod28:15)). He also carried special objects called "Urim" and "Thummim" that were used to learn God's will for the people.
