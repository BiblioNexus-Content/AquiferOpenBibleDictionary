## Pirathon (id: 7744)

PIRATHON
========

The home of Abdon, one of the minor judges ([Judges 12:13–15](https://ref.ly/Judg12:13-Judg12:15)). The Bible describes it as being in the land of Ephraim and in the hill country of the Amalekites. This may mean that at first it belonged to the Amalekites. Or it may be that they seized it during one of their invasions. 

The Bible calls Benaiah a “Pirathonite.” He was one of the mighty men of King David ([2 Samuel 23:30](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:30); [1 Chronicles 11:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:31); [27:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:14)). In general, this place is the same as Ferata. It is on a high rock 9\.7 kilometers (six miles) southwest of Samaria.
