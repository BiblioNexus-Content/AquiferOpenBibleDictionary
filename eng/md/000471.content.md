## Ariel (Person) (id: 3736)

ARIEL (Person)
==============

1. Person or thing who was overcome in a heroic deed by Benaiah, chief of David’s bodyguard ([2 Samuel 23:20](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:20); [1 Chronicles 11:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:22)). It is not clear that the Hebrew word ariel is a proper name in these passages. Benaiah may have killed two "lionlike men" of Moab (in the King James Version) or destroyed two Moabite altar hearths.
2. Name of one of the men Ezra sent to ask Iddo for Levitical priests to go with the Jewish exiles returning to Jerusalem from Babylon ([Ezra 8:16](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:16)).

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 23:20; 1CH 11:22; EZR 8:16
