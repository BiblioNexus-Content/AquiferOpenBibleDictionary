## Apostle, Apostleship (id: 3670)

APOSTLE, APOSTLESHIP
====================

The official title given to certain leaders in the New Testament churches. Apostleship refers to the work and duties of an apostle. People have many different ideas about where New Testament apostles came from, what they did, and their history. Different church traditions do not agree on these things. To understand the words "apostle" and "apostleship" better, we can look at where these words come from and what ideas are connected to them.

Where Did The Words "Apostle" and "Apostleship" Come From?
----------------------------------------------------------

The Greek word for "apostle" is not used outside the New Testament in the same sense as it is in the New Testament. It comes from the word meaning "to send." It is often used when discussing the sea, meaning a "ship" or "group of ships," a "marine expedition," or the "leader" of such an expedition. The term's usage is typically impersonal and passive, with no indication of personal initiative or authorization. Later papyri, ancient documents written on material made from a plant called papyrus, use the word to mean "bill," "invoice," or "passport." These words are also used by sailors.

Jesus Chooses His Twelve Apostles
---------------------------------

In the New Testament, "apostle" refers to those sent by Jesus to proclaim the gospel. From the larger group of his followers, Jesus selected twelve men ([Matthew 10:1](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:4)–[4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:4); [Mark 3:13](https://ref.ly/Mark3:13-Mark3:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:13-Mark3:19); [Luke 6:12](https://ref.ly/Luke6:12-Luke6:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:12-Luke6:16)). These twelve men:

* had a close relationship with him,
* received private instruction, and
* witnessed his miracles and disputes with Jewish authorities.

Jesus sent these twelve to: 

* preach repentance,
* cast out demons,
* heal the sick, and
* minister in ways similar to his own work ([Matthew 10:1](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:15); [Mark 6:7](https://ref.ly/Mark6:7-Mark6:13,Mark6:30)–[13, 30](https://ref.ly/Mark6:7-Mark6:13,Mark6:30); [Luke 9:1](https://ref.ly/Luke9:1-Luke9:6)–[6](https://ref.ly/Luke9:1-Luke9:6)).

They represented Jesus personally, as expressed in the saying "Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me" ([Luke 10:16](https://ref.ly/Luke10:16); compare [Matthew 10:40](https://ref.ly/Matt10:40)). The Twelve were not just supposed to teach what Jesus said. They were also meant to represent Jesus himself. 

After the resurrection, Jesus commissioned the twelve apostles to proclaim God's act in Christ for all people ([Matthew 28](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20); [Luke 24](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:53); [John 20–21](https://ref.ly/John20:1-John21:25)). Only those who had been with Jesus from the beginning of his ministry to his resurrection could be his apostles ([Acts 1:21](https://ref.ly/Acts1:21-Acts1:22)–[22](https://ref.ly/Acts1:21-Acts1:22)). Paul was qualified because he had seen the risen Christ ([1 Corinthians 15:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:4-1Cor15:10)–[10](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:4-1Cor15:10)).

How Is "Apostle" Used in Paul's Writings?
-----------------------------------------

In Paul's writings, there are two main uses of the word "apostle": 

* Sometimes, Paul uses "apostle" to mean people chosen by local churches to safely bring gifts to other Christians ([2 Corinthians 8:23](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:23); [Philippians 2:25\).](https://ref.ly/Phil2:25)
* More importantly, "apostle" is used in a technical sense with the qualifying phrase "of Jesus Christ" ([1 Corinthians 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:1); [2 Corinthians 1:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:1); [11:13](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:13); [Galatians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Gal1:1); [Ephesians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Eph1:1); [Colossians 1:1](https://ref.ly/Col1:1); [1 Thessalonians 2:6\).](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:6)

The "sent one" is the "sent one of Jesus Christ" ([Romans 16:7](https://ref.ly/Rom16:7); [1 Corinthians 9:1, 5](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1,1Cor9:5); [12:28](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28); [Galatians 1:17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:17-Gal1:19)–[19](https://ref.ly/Gal1:17-Gal1:19)). Paul says he has the right to be called an apostle. He bases this on the same ideas about apostles that Jesus taught. Paul always connects his claim to a specific event in his past. This event was when the risen Jesus appeared to him ([1 Corinthians 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1); [Galatians 1:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Gal1:12,Gal1:16)). Paul thought this appearance was just as important as the times Jesus appeared to others after he rose from the dead ([1 Corinthians 15:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8)–[8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8)). 

Paul argued his experience outside Damascus (compare [Acts 9:1](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19)–[19a](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:19); [22:6](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:16); [26:12](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:18); [Galatians 1:17](https://ref.ly/Gal1:17)) was a lifelong commission to preach the resurrected Christ ([1 Corinthians 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:17); [2:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:1-1Cor2:2)–[2](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:1-1Cor2:2)). He was called to preach mostly to gentiles ([Acts 9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Acts22:15); [26:17, 23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:17,Acts26:23); [Galatians 1:15](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15-Gal1:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Gal1:15-Gal1:16)). Through his preaching, Christ continued to work, creating the new people of God ([1 Corinthians 9:1](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1-1Cor9:2)–[2](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:1-1Cor9:2); [Galatians 2:8](https://ref.ly/Gal2:8)).
