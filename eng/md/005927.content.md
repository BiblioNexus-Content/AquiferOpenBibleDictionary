## Zela, Zelah (id: 9172)

ZELA, ZELAH
===========

A city of the tribe of Benjamin where they buried the bones of King Saul and his son Jonathan ([Joshua 18:28](https://ref.ly/Josh18:28); [2 Samuel 21:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:14)). Zela was probably the native town of Saul's father, Kish. It may have been the home of Saul before Samuel anointed him king.
