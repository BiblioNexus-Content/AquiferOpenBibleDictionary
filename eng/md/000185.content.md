## Ahijah (id: 3444)

AHIJAH
======

1. Ahitub’s son who was a priest at Shiloh. He took care of the ark of the covenant at Gibeah during Saul’s last battle ([1 Samuel 14:3, 18](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:3,1Sam14:18)). He may be the same person as Ahimelech or related to him ([1 Samuel 21:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:9); [22:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:9-1Sam22:20)).
2. One of King Solomon’s secretaries ([1 Kings 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:3)).
3. A prophet in Shiloh who told King Solomon’s official, Jeroboam, that the 10 northern tribes would rebel. Before Solomon died, Ahijah tore his robe into 12 pieces. He gave Jeroboam 10 pieces, saying that God would take 10 tribes from Solomon and give them to Jeroboam ([1 Kings 11:29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:29-1Kgs11:39)–[39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:29-1Kgs11:39); [2 Chronicles 10:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:15)).

    Later, when Jeroboam was unfaithful to Israel’s religion, he sent his wife to ask Ahijah about their sick son ([1 Kings 14:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:1-1Kgs14:5)–[5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:1-1Kgs14:5)). Even though he was old and blind, Ahijah predicted both the child’s death and the fall of Jeroboam and his family ([1 Kings 14:6](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:6-1Kgs14:17)–[17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:6-1Kgs14:17); [15:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:28-1Kgs15:30)–[30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:28-1Kgs15:30)). “The Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite” was a source for writings about Solomon’s life ([2 Chronicles 9:29](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:29)).

4. The father of King Baasha of the northern kingdom of Israel ([1 Kings 15:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27-1Kgs15:28,1Kgs15:33)–[28, 33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:27-1Kgs15:28,1Kgs15:33); [21:22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:22); [2 Kings 9:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:9)).
5. Jerahmeel’s son from the tribe of Judah ([1 Chronicles 2:25](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:25)).
6. Ehud’s son ([1 Chronicles 8:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:7)). However, the Hebrew is difficult to translate. Some English translations call Ahijah one of Ehud’s sons, while others call Ahijah the one who carried Ehud’s sons, Uzza and Ahihud, into exile.
7. A warrior among David’s mighty men who were known as “the thirty” ([1 Chronicles 11:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:36)). He is also called Eliam, the son of Ahithophel ([2 Samuel 23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)).
8. A Levite who was in charge of King David’s temple treasury ([1 Chronicles 26:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:20)).
9. An ancestor of the prophet Ezra ([2 Esdras 1:2](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:2)).
