TORTOISE
========

A tortoise is a slow\-moving reptile with a hard shell that lives on land.

In Bible times, the word “tortoise” in some English translations may actually refer to certain kinds of lizards ([Leviticus 11:29](https://ref.ly/Lev11:29)). This is because the original Hebrew word in that verse is uncertain and could describe a different reptile common in the Middle East.
