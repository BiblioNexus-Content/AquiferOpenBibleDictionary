## Logos (id: 6770)

LOGOS\*
=======

English transliteration of a Greek term for “word.” The term is significant because in John’s writings it refers to Jesus. The prologue of John’s Gospel ([Jn 1:1, 14](https://ref.ly/John1:1,John1:14)) and the beginning of 1 John ([1 Jn 1:1](https://ref.ly/1John1:1)) use logos to show how Jesus can be God and yet be an expression of God in the world. The divine Word took on human form and became a historical personage. Logos is also the title of Christ in the vision of his divine glory ([Rv 19:13](https://ref.ly/Rev19:13)). Writers outside the NT, such as Philo of Alexandria, used the term but with a different meaning.
