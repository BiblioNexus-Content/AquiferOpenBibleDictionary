## Wrath of God (id: 9095)

WRATH OF GOD
============

Wrath is a word that describes God's strong disapproval of human beings and their sinful actions. In the original languages of the Bible, many different words and phrases are used to talk about wrath. All of these words express the idea of justifiable anger in response to unjust actions.

In the Old Testament
--------------------

In the Old Testament, God is said to be angry with nations, sinners, and even his covenant people. God’s anger first showed toward Israel after they refused to believe his word about entering the promised land. After being rescued from Egypt, receiving the Ten Commandments and the covenant, and seeing God's glory, they still did not believe ([Numbers 11:10](https://ref.ly/Num11:10); [12:9](https://ref.ly/Num12:9); [22:22](https://ref.ly/Num22:22); [32:10–14](https://ref.ly/Num32:10-Num32:14)). So, God condemned the Israelites to wander in the wilderness until they died. The main reason for God’s anger in the Old Testament was that his people constantly broke the covenant. They provoked him by: 

* Worshiping other gods ([Deuteronomy 2:15](https://ref.ly/Deut2:15); [4:25](https://ref.ly/Deut4:25); [9:7](https://ref.ly/Deut9:7-Deut9:8,Deut9:19)[–](https://ref.ly/Deut9:7-Deut9:8)[8, 19](https://ref.ly/Deut9:7-Deut9:8,Deut9:19); [Judges 2:14](https://ref.ly/Judg2:14); [1 Kings 11:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:9); [14:9, 15](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:9,1Kgs14:15); [2 Kings 17:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:18))
* Mixing non\-Jewish practices in with their worship ([Isaiah 1:10](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:10-Isa1:17); [Jeremiah 6:20](https://ref.ly/Jer6:20); [Hosea 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6); [Amos 5:21](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:27)[–](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:27)[27](https://ref.ly/Amos5:21-Amos5:27))
* Their rebellion ([1 Kings 8:46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:46))
* Their unbelief ([Numbers 11:33](https://ref.ly/Num11:33); [14:11, 33](https://ref.ly/Num14:11,Num14:33); [Psalm 95:10](https://ref.ly/Ps95:10-Ps95:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps95:10-Ps95:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:10-Ps95:11))
* Their disregard for his concern for love, justice, righteousness, and holiness ([Exodus 22:22](https://ref.ly/Exod22:22-Exod22:24)[–](https://ref.ly/Exod22:22-Exod22:24)[24](https://ref.ly/Exod22:22-Exod22:24); [Isaiah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Isa1:15-Isa1:17)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa1:15-Isa1:17)[17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:15-Isa1:17); [Amos 5:7](https://ref.ly/Amos5:7-Amos5:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Amos5:7-Amos5:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Amos5:7-Amos5:12); [Micah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Mic3:1))

The wrath of God also extends to all humanity ([Nahum 1:2](https://ref.ly/Nah1:2)). The Day of the Lord concept, developed by prophets, warns that no one can escape God’s righteous wrath ([Amos 5:18](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)). The Day of the Lord is the day of his wrath ([Zephaniah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:15)).

The Old Testament balances God’s wrath with his patience, love, and readiness to forgive. 

1. God is patient. The Hebrew word for “patient” relates to the word for “wrath” and means “length of wrath”; God does not quickly become angry. He is longsuffering ([Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6)).
2. God is full of compassion and faithfulness ([Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6)). Even when his children sin, he is like a father, full of compassion and love. He is always faithful to his children.
3. God is ready to forgive those who atone for and cleanse their sins ([Exodus 34:6](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6)). His love is much greater than his wrath ([Psalm 30:5](https://ref.ly/Ps30:5)). Micah prayed that the Lord would soon forgive and restore his people, believing he cannot be angry forever ([Psalm 7:18](https://ref.ly/Mic7:18); compare [Psalm 89:46](https://ref.ly/Ps89:46); [Jeremiah 3:5](https://ref.ly/Jer3:5)). In [Psalm 103:8](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8-Ps103:13)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8-Ps103:13)[13](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8-Ps103:13), the psalmist compares God’s love and forgiveness to a father who does not stay angry or harshly discipline his children because of his great love for those who fear him.

The purpose of God’s wrath is not to destroy humanity ([Hosea 11:9](https://ref.ly/Hos11:9)). His wrath is not a vindictive, emotional overreaction, nor is it unpredictable. In his wrath, he controls nations (like Babylon and Assyria) and disciplines his people so they return to him ([Joel 2:13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13-Joel2:14)[–](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13-Joel2:14)[14](https://ref.ly/Joel2:13-Joel2:14)). The Old Testament's Day of the Lord does not end with God's anger; it concludes with the earth's restoration when it will be filled with the knowledge of God ([Isaiah 11:9](https://ref.ly/Isa11:9); [Hebrews 2:14](https://ref.ly/Hab2:14)), and wickedness will be no more ([Isaiah 65:25](https://ref.ly/Isa65:25)).

In the New Testament
--------------------

The New Testament also teaches about God's wrath alongside his grace, love, and patience ([Matthew 3:7](https://ref.ly/Matt3:7); [Luke 21:23](https://ref.ly/Luke21:23); [John 3:36](https://ref.ly/John3:36); [Romans 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18); [Ephesians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Eph5:6); [Revelation 14:10](https://ref.ly/Rev14:10)). Those who do not believe in the risen Christ remain in their sins and will face God’s wrath. Those who believe are saved from it ([Ephesians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Eph2:3); [1 Thessalonians 1:10](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:10)). The good news of the New Testament is that Jesus came to save us from God’s wrath ([Romans 5:9](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9)). Those saved are reconciled with God because they no longer are under condemnation ([Romans 5:10](https://ref.ly/Rom5:10); [8:1](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1)).
