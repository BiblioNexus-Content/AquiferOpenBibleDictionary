CHARISMATA
==========

*Charismata* is a Greek word that means “gifts” or “grace gifts.” These are special abilities that the Holy Spirit gives to people in the church ([1 Corinthians 12](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:31); [14](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:1-1Cor14:40)). These gifts are meant to help the church grow and serve others.
