## Jachin and Boaz (id: 6155)

JACHIN AND BOAZ\*
=================

Names of two pillars Solomon set up before the temple vestibule. He named the south pillar Jachin and the north pillar Boaz ([1 Kgs 7:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:21); [2 Chr 3:17](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:17)). These hollow pillars were cast of bronze and measured about 27 feet (8\.2 meters) in height and about 18 feet (5\.5 meters) in circumference (nearly 6 feet, or 1\.8 meters, in diameter). They were crowned with a capital (ornate cap or top) about 7½ feet (2\.3 meters) high that consisted of cast lily work, chains, and 200 pomegranates each ([1 Kgs 7:15–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:15-1Kgs7:20); [2 Chr 3:15–16](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:15-2Chr3:16); [4:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr4:13)).
