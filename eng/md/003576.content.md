## Machbenah (id: 6833)

MACHBENAH
=========

A place mentioned in the family records of Caleb and Judah ([1 Chronicles 2:49](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:49)). The name Machbenah appears in a list with other geographical locations. It is listed before Gibea, which is probably the same town mentioned in [Joshua 15:57](https://ref.ly/Josh15:57). This suggests that Machbenah was likely located in the eastern part of the hill country south of Hebron. This area was known to be inhabited by the descendants of Caleb.
