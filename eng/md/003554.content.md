## Maacathite, Maachathi, Maachathite (id: 6810)

MAACATHITE, MAACHATHI, MAACHATHITE
==================================

A Maacathite was a person from the land of Maacah. This land was near Geshur and close to the border of the land given to the half\-tribe of Manasseh ([Deuteronomy 3:14](https://ref.ly/Deut3:14); [Joshua 12:5](https://ref.ly/Josh12:5); [13:11](https://ref.ly/Josh13:11)). Jair took control of this land, but he and his people could not remove the Maacathites and Geshurites who still lived there ([Joshua 13:13](https://ref.ly/Josh13:13)).

One Maacathite named Eliphelet joined David’s army. He was one of David’s "mighty men" ([2 Samuel 23:34](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:34)). In another list, he is called a Mekerathite ([1 Chronicles 11:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:36)). This may be a different name for the same place or person.

The Maacathites were not friendly toward Israel. Many years later, after Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, a man named Jaazaniah (whose father was a Maacathite) joined Ishmael the Ammonite to fight against Gedaliah. Gedaliah had been chosen by King Nebuchadnezzar to govern the city ([2 Kings 25:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23); [Jeremiah 40:8](https://ref.ly/Jer40:8)).
