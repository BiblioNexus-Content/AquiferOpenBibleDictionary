## Zur (id: 9269)

ZUR
===

1. A prince of Midian and the father of Cozbi, a Midianite woman who was killed by Phinehas. Cozbi was in an improper relationship with Zimri, an Israelite man, during the incident at Baal\-peor ([Numbers 25:15](https://ref.ly/Num25:15)). Zur was later killed by the Israelites, along with four other Midianite kings and Balaam, as part of God's judgment on Midian ([31:8](https://ref.ly/Num31:8)). He seems to have been under the authority of Sihon, the Amorite king, since he is listed as one of Sihon's "princes" ([Joshua 13:21](https://ref.ly/Josh13:21)).
2. A son of Jeiel, who established the town of Gibeon ([1 Chronicles 8:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:30); [9:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:36)). He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a distant relative of King Saul.
