## Hadid (id: 5576)

HADID
=====

City in Benjamin ([Neh 11:31–35](https://ref.ly/Neh11:31-Neh11:35)) mentioned with Lod and Ono ([Ezr 2:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:33); [Neh 7:37](https://ref.ly/Neh7:37)) as the home of over 720 Benjamites returning from the Babylonian captivity ([Neh 11:34](https://ref.ly/Neh11:34)). In [1 Maccabees 12:38](https://ref.ly/1Macc12:38) and [13:13](https://ref.ly/1Macc13:13) the place is identified with Adida, which was fortified by Simon Maccabeus and later by Vespasian. A more likely suggestion identifies it with the modern site of el\-Haditheth, about three to four miles (4\.8 to 6\.4 kilometers) northeast of Lydda.
