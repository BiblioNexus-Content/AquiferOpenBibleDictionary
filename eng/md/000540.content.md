## Ashpenaz (id: 3807)

ASHPENAZ
========

An official under Nebuchadnezzar who was in charge of palace personnel ([Daniel 1:3](https://ref.ly/Dan1:3)). Ashpenaz wanted to force Daniel and his friends to eat the king’s food. Eating the gentile's food would have violated the law of God. Eventually, he allowed them to follow their own diet ([Daniel 1:8](https://ref.ly/Dan1:8-Dan1:16)–[16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:8-Dan1:16)). 

Three years later, Ashpenaz showed the young men to the king. Nebuchadnezzar thought they were very wise and had good judgment even though they did not eat meat and did not indulge in royal food ([Daniel 1:18](https://ref.ly/Dan1:18-Dan1:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/Dan1:18-Dan1:20)).
