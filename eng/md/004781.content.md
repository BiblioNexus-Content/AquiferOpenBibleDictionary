## Riphath (id: 8045)

RIPHATH
=======

Gomer’s son and the brother of Ashkenaz and Togarmah, non\-Semitic descendants of Noah through Japheth’s line ([Gn 10:3](https://ref.ly/Gen10:3)). [First Chronicles 1:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:6), a parallel passage, reads Diphath instead of Riphath, undoubtedly a latter copyist’s misspelling that was never corrected.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 10:3; 1CH 1:6
