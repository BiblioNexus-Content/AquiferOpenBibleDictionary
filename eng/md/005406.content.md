## Swallow (id: 8667)

SWALLOW
=======

A swallow is a small bird with black or dark brown feathers and a forked tail. It has long, narrow wings and flies with smooth, quick movements. The barn swallow (*Hirundo rustica*) is the most common type. Swallows have small, weak feet and cannot walk well. Swallows are similar to swifts in shape and life habits but are somewhat smaller.

The swallow has a large mouth that helps it catch insects while flying. Its feathers can be brown, blue, or white. Swallows often make nests inside buildings. The psalmist once spoke about seeing a swallow’s nest at the temple ([Psalm 84:3](https://ref.ly/Ps84:3)).

Swallows usually live year\-round in Israel. This is different from swifts, which migrate on a regular schedule. The word “swallow” in [Isaiah 38:14](https://ref.ly/Isa38:14) probably means “swift.” In [Jeremiah 8:7](https://ref.ly/Jer8:7), the writer compares the swift’s regular migration with the unfaithfulness of God’s people. [Proverbs 26:2](https://ref.ly/Prov26:2) may refer to either the swallow or the swift.
