## Pur (id: 7866)

PUR
===

A Hebrew word that means “lot” (used in the casting of lots to decide on something). The name of the Jewish festival Purim comes from this word. Haman, an enemy of the Jews, cast the *pur* (lot) to choose a day to destroy the Jewish people. The festival Purim celebrates the rescue of the Jews from Haman's plan ([Esther 3:7](https://ref.ly/Esth3:7); [9:24–26](https://ref.ly/Esth9:24-Esth9:26)).
