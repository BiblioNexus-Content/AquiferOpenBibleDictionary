## Rainbow (id: 7913)

RAINBOW
=======

Sign of God’s covenant with Noah following the flood ([Gn 9:8–17](https://ref.ly/Gen9:8-Gen9:17)). The normal Hebrew word for “war bow” is used. Jewish tradition interpreted this as a symbol that God’s anger had ceased since the rainbow pointed downward, just as an antagonist lowers his bow to declare peace. In the NT, the rainbow forms part of the heavenly vision ([Rv 4:3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:3); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Rev10:1)).
