## Sheshan (id: 8377)

SHESHAN
=======

Descendant of Judah through Jerahmeel, whose family line is traced in [1 Chronicles 2:25–41](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:25-1Chr2:41) to Elishama, evidently a contemporary of the writer. In verse [31](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:31)Sheshan’s son Ahlai is named, but verse [34](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:34) says that Sheshan had no sons. Perhaps two men of the same name are denoted here, or Ahlai may be identical with Attai, Sheshan’s grandson.
