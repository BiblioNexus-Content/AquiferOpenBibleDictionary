## Jehosheba (id: 6286)

JEHOSHEBA
=========

Daughter of King Jehoram of Judah (853–841 BC) and Queen Athaliah, sister of King Ahaziah (841 BC), and wife of Jehoiada the high priest. Upon Ahaziah’s death, Athaliah attempted to kill all the remaining royal heirs to the throne; Jehosheba, however, hid young Joash, Ahaziah’s son, in a temple bedroom for the duration of Athaliah’s reign (841–835 BC; [2 Kgs 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:2)). Jehosheba is alternately spelled Jehoshabeath in [2 Chronicles 22:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:11).
