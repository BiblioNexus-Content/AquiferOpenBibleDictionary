## Jerusalem Council (id: 6331)

JERUSALEM COUNCIL
=================

The Jerusalem Council was a large Christian meeting held about AD 50 ([Acts 15:6–29](https://ref.ly/Acts15:6-Acts15:29)). According to the book of Acts, the meeting was held to answer one important question: Do gentile (non\-Jewish) believers need to be circumcised and follow the law of Moses to be saved? 

Some Jewish believers from Judea brought this question to Antioch ([14:26–15:1](https://ref.ly/Acts14:26-Acts15:1)). Later, the church took the matter to the leaders in Jerusalem to resolve ([15:3–5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:3-Acts15:5)). The apostles and the elders considered the matter for a long time (verse [6](https://ref.ly/Acts15:6)). This included the apostles Peter and Paul and Barnabas (verses [7–11](https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11); [12, 22–26](https://ref.ly/Acts15:12,Acts15:22-Acts15:26)). James, the brother of Jesus, seems to have been the moderator of the meeting (verses [13–21](https://ref.ly/Acts15:13-Acts15:21)).

What Did the Council Decide?
----------------------------

The leaders at the Jerusalem Council agreed on four main points:

1. God makes no distinction between believers in Christ, whether Jewish or gentile ([Acts 15:9](https://ref.ly/Acts15:9)).
2. Salvation comes through the grace of the Lord Jesus by faith (verses [9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts15:9-Acts15:11)).
3. God confirmed his acceptance of gentiles through signs and wonders (verses [8, 12](https://ref.ly/Acts15:8,Acts15:12)).
4. Inclusion of the gentiles among the people of God was part of the divine plan revealed in the Old Testament (verses [15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts15:15-Acts15:18); quoting [Amos 9:11–12](https://ref.ly/Amos9:11-Amos9:12)).

The assembly also issued a list (sometimes called “the decree”) instructing gentile Christians to abstain from: 

* idol worship,
* sexual sin,
* eating strangled animals, and
* consuming blood.

(These last two items were about food. These food practices were a major difference between Jews and gentiles.) The leaders wrote a letter with these instructions and sent it to the churches in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia ([Acts 15:23](https://ref.ly/Acts15:23); compare [16:4](https://ref.ly/Acts16:4)).

**Who Belongs to the People of God?**
-------------------------------------

This story is a key moment in the book of Acts. It shows how the early church was learning what it meant to be the people of God. Many early Jewish believers still understood their faith as obedience to the law, including ceremonies and rituals. They believed that following the law and religious customs was necessary for salvation and to remain in God’s favor. They also believed that only the people of Israel had a special place with God. Jews regarded their nation alone as “the people of God” and expected converts to be circumcised, follow the law of Moses, and offer the required sacrifices. Even after believing in Jesus as the Messiah, some early Christians in Jerusalem still held these beliefs.

The book of Acts shows how God corrected some wrong ideas in the early church. Some Jewish believers thought God only cared about Israel. They believed people had to follow all the Jewish laws to be accepted by God. But God used several events to show that this was not true.

Stephen challenged the idea that God was only present in Jerusalem ([Acts 7](https://ref.ly/Acts7:1-Acts7:60)). Then Philip preached to Samaritans and to an Ethiopian official, people who were not fully connected to Judaism ([Acts 8](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:40)). 

God directly told Peter to visit Cornelius. He was a God\-fearing man but an uncircumcised gentile ([Acts 10](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:48)). Peter told Cornelius that Jesus is the Messiah and Lord. Through this event, Peter realized that God does not show favoritism. God accepts people from every nation who honor him and do what is right ([10:34–35](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:35)). 

The Holy Spirit came upon Cornelius and his household while Peter was still speaking ([10:44](https://ref.ly/Acts10:44)). This was clear and surprising proof that God had accepted these gentile believers. Even the Jewish believers who were very strict about circumcision could not deny what they saw (verses [45–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:45-Acts10:48)). Likewise, those who later heard the story could not deny it ([11:1–18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:1-Acts11:18)). Peter used this same example when he spoke at the Jerusalem Council ([15:7–11](https://ref.ly/Acts15:7-Acts15:11)).

Some strict Jewish believers may have thought that God’s acceptance of Cornelius was a special case. But this view became impossible as more gentiles believed in Jesus.

In Antioch, Greek\-speaking gentiles also became followers of Jesus ([11:20](https://ref.ly/Acts11:20)). A new church started there, made up of both Jews and gentiles. The church leaders came from many different backgrounds ([Acts 13:1](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1)). Later, during Paul’s first missionary trip, many more gentiles believed in Jesus in the region of south\-central Asia Minor (chapters [13–14](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts14:28)).

At this point in the story, some Jewish Christians from Jerusalem came to Antioch. They caused a crisis by saying that gentile believers had to be circumcised and follow the law of Moses. This was like saying gentiles had to become Jews in every way (by nation, culture, and religion) before they could follow Jesus.

This forced the early church to answer two big questions:

* Was Christianity just a part of Judaism, or something different?
* And was salvation based on law and national identity, or was it by God’s grace through faith?

What Did the Council's Decision Mean?
-------------------------------------

The Jerusalem Council made it clear that salvation is a free gift from God. People receive it by faith, not by their own efforts. The council rejected the idea that anyone can earn salvation by keeping laws or following religious ceremonies. 

This also showed that Christianity is not limited to any one race, nation, culture, or social group. All people can follow Jesus.

At the same time, the council reminded believers to live in a way that pleases God. Christians should act with care, respecting God’s moral standards and being thoughtful about how their actions affect others in the church.
