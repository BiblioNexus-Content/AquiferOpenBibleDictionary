## Helkath-hazzurim (id: 5785)

HELKATH\-HAZZURIM
=================

An area near the pool of Gibeon, where a deadly battle took place. Twelve warriors from Joab's army and twelve from Abner's army fought against each other. All 24 men died in this fight, as each fighter killed his opponent([2 Samuel 2:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:16)). 

Some scholars think the name may mean, “field of the crafty,” which could be understood as “field of ambush” or “field of the adversaries.” The New living Translation marginal reading calls it, “the Field of Swords.”

* **Associated Passages:** 2SA 2:16
