## Wisdom Literature (id: 9074)

WISDOM LITERATURE
=================

Wisdom Literature refers to writings in the Old Testament that focus on wisdom. In this context, wisdom means understanding how to live well and make good decisions.

The main biblical books in this genre are Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. Some parts of the Psalms and the books of the Prophets also contain wisdom writings. 

Wisdom Literature includes different types of wisdom. The book of Proverbs mainly teaches moral wisdom. This kind of wisdom shows people how to live good and right lives. The books of Job and Ecclesiastes explore intellectual wisdom. These books look at big questions about human life and try to understand why things happen the way they do.

Wisdom Literature is an important part of the Old Testament. It is found in the third section of the Hebrew Bible, called the Writings. It includes Proverbs, Ecclesiastes (also known as Koheleth), and Job. There are also wisdom psalms (for example, [Psalms 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6), [32](https://ref.ly/Ps32:1-Ps32:11), [34](https://ref.ly/Ps34:1-Ps34:22), [37](https://ref.ly/Ps37:1-Ps37:40)) and wisdom passages in the Prophets (such as the parables of Isaiah). 

In the Greek Old Testament and English Apocrypha (a set of books that some churches include in their Bibles), there are two more wisdom books:

* Ecclesiasticus, which was written by Jesus ben Sirach during the second\-century BC
* The Wisdom of Solomon, a work by an unknown author that shows how Jewish wisdom ideas grew during a time when Greek culture was very influential

Proverbs
--------

To understand Old Testament Wisdom Literature, we start with the book of Proverbs. This book teaches about morality, which means how to live a good life. While it is based on belief in God, much of its wisdom applies to everyday life.

The most important idea in Proverbs is respect for God. But the book mostly focuses on teaching basic good behavior. It talks about being honest, having self\-control, being fair, and using common sense. It also shows how life can go wrong for people who do not follow this wisdom.

Proverbs was written to teach. Today, we can read it like any other book. But in the past, young people would learn it from wise teachers. They would try to remember the short, poetic sayings. These sayings would then help guide them throughout their lives. Proverbs teaches that there is a good way to live. This way is based on doing what is right. Living this way leads to success because it follows the wisdom of the one who created all life (God).

The wise teachers who wrote Proverbs were like guides. They did not create new ideas about life or try to answer difficult questions. Instead, they shared the most valuable knowledge: how to live well. Wisdom is “more precious than rubies; nothing you desire compares with her. Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. All her ways are pleasant, and all her paths are peaceful.” ([Proverbs 3:15–17](https://ref.ly/Prov3:15-Prov3:17)).

Ecclesiastes
------------

The book of Ecclesiastes shows the wisdom of someone who has lived a long life and seen the world in many ways. The writer had a deep faith that came from difficult experiences, not from an easy life. The writer of Ecclesiastes noticed that life is not always fair. He saw that good people do not always have good lives, and bad people do not always suffer for their actions. Often, good people suffer without any relief, while bad people enjoy life without worries.

The writer looked for justice in the world. He watched life carefully and honestly, but he did not always see justice being done. He also looked for ultimate truth, but even this seemed out of reach. He felt that everything in life was meaningless, like trying to catch the wind!

Even though Ecclesiastes sounds doubtful and negative, it actually shows great faith. The writer held onto his belief in God even when the world seemed full of evil and meaningless things. This is a strong kind of faith. The writer of Ecclesiastes could not be as hopeful as some other Bible writers, such as the prophets. But he held onto the basic truth of God when everything else, including his understanding, failed him. The book of Ecclesiastes can be comforting for people who see the world as it really is, with all its pain and seeming meaninglessness. 

Job
---

The book of Job looks at life's problems from the view of someone who is suffering. While the writer of Ecclesiastes watched life's sadness from the outside, Job felt it personally. Job knew and lived by the old wisdom sayings. He was a good man who followed the teachings found in the book of Proverbs. Before his troubles, Job believed that living a good life would lead to happiness and success.

But then everything in Job's life fell apart. He lost his possessions, his land, and his good name. His children died, and he became very sick. All of this made Job question the wisdom he had always believed in.

Job's story raises big questions about life and God:

1. How can God be fair when life seems so unfair?
2. How can God be just when bad people often do well in life ([Job 21:7–15](https://ref.ly/Job21:7-Job21:15))?
3. If Job's suffering is an example of human life, does God's creation really show goodness and order?

These are hard questions, and the book of Job doesn't give simple answers.

The most important part of Job's story is when he meets God face to face in chapters [38–42](https://ref.ly/Job38:1-Job42:17). This meeting helps put wisdom in the right place. It shows that there will always be things about God and his ways that people cannot fully understand. Our minds are not able to fully understand all of God's wisdom.

Wisdom means trying to know God better. But we can never know everything about God just by thinking and learning. God is always greater than what our minds can understand.

Job's story teaches us something new about wisdom. Even though Job's questions were not answered directly, they stopped being important when he met God. The meeting with God changed Job completely. So the deepest wisdom is not about finding answers to the biggest questions. It is about meeting the living God.

Conclusion
----------

Wisdom Literature in the Bible teaches us many things. It combines ideas from three main books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job. There is a basic knowledge about how to live well. This wisdom is important for young people to learn as they grow up. Living by this wisdom might not always make you rich, but it can help you live well even when life is hard. The most important part of this wisdom is to respect God.

As people grow older, they often realize that life and the world are not simple. Sometimes, this makes people want to give up on the basic wisdom they learned when they were young. The book of Ecclesiastes can help during these times. It teaches that even when life seems pointless, we should still believe in God and respect Him. The last verses of Ecclesiastes ([12:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:13-Eccl12:14)) remind us of this important truth.. 

Some people might go through very hard times, like Job did in the Bible. In these times, wisdom reaches its limits. We cannot always find answers to our questions about why bad things happen. The book of Job teaches that in these moments, the most important thing is to experience God's presence, even if we do not understand everything.
