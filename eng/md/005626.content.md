## Tob (id: 8882)

TOB
===

A place where Jephthah went to live after his half brothers forced him to leave because he was born to a different mother ([Judges 11:3–5](https://ref.ly/Judg11:3-Judg11:5)). During the rule of King David, the Ammonites hired 12,000 men from Tob as soldiers to fight against David ([2 Samuel 10:6–8](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:6-2Sam10:8)). 

Tob was probably the same as the Aramean kingdom called Tob, which was located in the desert to the east or northeast of Gilead. Many years later, during the time of the Maccabees, a group of Jewish people lived in Tob.
