## Sin unto Death (id: 8521)

SIN UNTO DEATH\*
================

Sin mentioned in [1 John 5:16](https://ref.ly/1John5:16); in this verse John discourages prayer for those who sin in this way. Most likely, John was speaking of those who decisively turn their backs upon the truth, as well as those false teachers who deceive the church ([Heb 6:4–6](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:6); [2 Jn 1:7–9](https://ref.ly/2John1:7-2John1:9)).
