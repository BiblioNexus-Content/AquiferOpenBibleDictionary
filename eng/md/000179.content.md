## Ahi (id: 3461)

AHI
===

1. Abdiel's son, a clan leader in the tribe of Gad ([1 Chronicles 5:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:15)).
2. Shemer's brother and a member of the tribe of Asher ([1 Chronicles 7:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:34)). However, in this verse, "Ahi" is probably not a name and should be translated as "brother," as in most modern translations.
