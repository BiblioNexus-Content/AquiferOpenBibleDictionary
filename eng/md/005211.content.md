## Sibmah (id: 8475)

SIBMAH
======

A city located in the pasture lands of the region across the Jordan River (Transjordan). The sons of Gad and Reuben wanted this land ([Numbers 32:3](https://ref.ly/Num32:3)). God gave this area to the tribe of Reuben ([Joshua 13:19](https://ref.ly/Josh13:19)). Later, the Moabites took the city from Reuben. Sibmah was famous for its vineyards ([Isaiah 16:8–9](https://ref.ly/Isa16:8-Isa16:9); [Jeremiah 48:32](https://ref.ly/Jer48:32)). "Sebam" is another name for "Sibmah" in the Hebrew text (compare [Numbers 32:38](https://ref.ly/Num32:38); [Joshua 13:19](https://ref.ly/Josh13:19); [Isaiah 16:8–9](https://ref.ly/Isa16:8-Isa16:9); [Jeremiah 48:32](https://ref.ly/Jer48:32)).
