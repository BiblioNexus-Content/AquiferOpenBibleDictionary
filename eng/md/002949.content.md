## James (Person) (id: 6202)

JAMES (Person)
==============

1. James, the brother of Jesus, was an important leader (the leading elder) in the church in Jerusalem. He also wrote the Letter of James in the New Testament.

    The Gospels only mention James twice. These mentions list him with his brothers Joseph (or Joses), Simon, and Judas ([Matthew 13:55](https://ref.ly/Matt13:55); [Mark 6:3](https://ref.ly/Mark6:3)). James may have been the oldest of the brothers after Jesus. James might have been the oldest brother after Jesus. Some people wonder if these were Jesus's full brothers or not. But the Bible seems to say clearly that they were. Like his other brothers, James did not accept Jesus's authority while Jesus was alive ([John 7:5](https://ref.ly/John7:5)).

    James’s conversion is not mentioned. It may have happened when Jesus appeared to him and others after his resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:7)). He became head of the church at Jerusalem ([Acts 12:17](https://ref.ly/Acts12:17); [21:18](https://ref.ly/Acts21:18); [Galatians 2:9](https://ref.ly/Gal2:9)). Jesus had taught that following him was more important than being related to someone ([Matthew 12:48–50](https://ref.ly/Matt12:48-Matt12:50); [Mark 3:33–35](https://ref.ly/Mark3:33-Mark3:35); [Luke 8:21](https://ref.ly/Luke8:21)). But it is likely that being Jesus's brother helped James become a respected leader.

    People saw James as an apostle ([Galatians 1:19](https://ref.ly/Gal1:19)), even though he was not one of the original twelve apostles. Some suggest he was a replacement for the martyred son of Zebedee. Others think the term “apostle” can mean both “the Twelve” and “all the apostles” (see the two separate categories cited in [1 Corinthians 15:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:5), [7](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:7)).

    Tradition says that Jesus and the apostles chose James to be the first bishop of Jerusalem. What is certain is that he led the first Council of Jerusalem. This meeting was about how to welcome non\-Jewish people into the Christian church. James helped make the final decision that was sent to churches in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia ([Acts 15:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts15:19-Acts15:20)). James felt his main job was to teach Jewish people about Jesus. He helped solve arguments in the new church about how Jewish laws applied to new Christians, both Jewish and non\-Jewish.

    James kept following many Jewish practices even as a Christian. We can see this in what he asked Paul to do when Paul visited Jerusalem for the last time ([Acts 21:18–25](https://ref.ly/Acts21:18-Acts21:25)). This is the last time the book of Acts mentions James. He is traditionally considered to be the author of the Letter of James, where he describes himself as “a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” ([James 1:1](https://ref.ly/Jas1:1)).

    An early Christian writer named Hegesippus (who died around AD 180\) said people called James "the Just." This was because James carefully followed Jewish law and lived a simple life. It seems clear that James was martyred (killed for his faith). A Jewish historian named Josephus says this happened in the year AD 61\. There was a Jewish uprising after the Roman governor Festus died, and before a new one had been chosen.

2. James, son of Alphaeus. He was one of Jesus's 12 apostles.

    James, son of Alphaeus, is always listed as one of the 12 apostles ([Matthew 10:3](https://ref.ly/Matt10:3); [Mark 3:18](https://ref.ly/Mark3:18); [Luke 6:15](https://ref.ly/Luke6:15); [Acts 1:13](https://ref.ly/Acts1:13)). But, we do not know much about him for certain. Levi (also known as Matthew) is also described as the son of Alphaeus ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14)). But, he and James were probably not brothers. Many scholars think this James might be the same person as the one called “James the less” or “James the smaller.” The description “the less” seems to have been given to distinguish him from the son of Zebedee. It may indicate that he was either smaller or younger than Zebedee’s son (the Greek word can cover both interpretations).

3. James, son of Zebedee. He was one of Jesus's 12 apostles. He was the first apostle to die for his faith (martyred in AD 44\).

    James was a Galilean fisherman. We can assume he had a comfortable lifestyle ([Mark 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20)). He was called to be one of the disciples at the same time as his brother John ([Matthew 4:21](https://ref.ly/Matt4:21); [Mark 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:19-Mark1:20)). It is reasonable to assume that he was older than John, both because he is almost always mentioned first and because John is sometimes identified as “the brother of James” ([Matthew 10:2](https://ref.ly/Matt10:2); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1); [Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17); [5:37](https://ref.ly/Mark5:37)).

    James, John, and Simon Peter were part of a fishing partnership that included Andrew, Simon’s brother ([Luke 5:10](https://ref.ly/Luke5:10)). The three reached, in a sense, a place of leadership among the disciples. They were often with Jesus during important events. For example:

    * They were there when Jairus’s daughter was raised ([Mark 5:37](https://ref.ly/Mark5:37); [Luke 8:51](https://ref.ly/Luke8:51)).
        * They were at the Transfiguration when Jesus's appearance changed ([Matthew 17:1](https://ref.ly/Matt17:1); [Mark 9:2](https://ref.ly/Mark9:2); [Luke 9:28](https://ref.ly/Luke9:28)).
        * They were with Jesus on the Mount of Olives ([Mk 13:3](https://ref.ly/Mark13:3)).
        * They were with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane ([Matthew 26:37](https://ref.ly/Matt26:37); [Mark 14:33](https://ref.ly/Mark14:33)).
        Also, James and John had earlier gone with Jesus to the home of Simon and Andrew ([Mark 1:29](https://ref.ly/Mark1:29)).

    Jesus gave James and John the nickname Boanerges, meaning “sons of thunder” ([Mark 3:17](https://ref.ly/Mark3:17)). Jesus corrected them for speaking without thinking and for not understanding why he had come. This might have happened when they wanted to pray for a Samaritan village to be destroyed because the people there did not welcome Jesus's messengers ([Luke 9:54](https://ref.ly/Luke9:54); compare [Mark 9:38](https://ref.ly/Mark9:38); [Luke 9:49](https://ref.ly/Luke9:49)).

    James and John once asked Jesus for important positions in his kingdom. This showed they did not understand Jesus's message yet. Jesus prophesied that James and his brother would drink the cup their Master was to drink ([Mark 10:35–40](https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:40); compare. [Matthew 20:20–23](https://ref.ly/Matt20:20-Matt20:23)). (Jesus was telling them they would suffer like he would.) James and John were probably with the other disciples when Jesus appeared by the Sea of Galilee after he rose from the dead ([John 21:1](https://ref.ly/John21:1)). Strangely, the book of John never mentions James by name.

    We do not know much about what James did after this until about the year AD 44\. That's when what Jesus said came true: James was killed "by the sword" by King Herod Agrippa I. James was the first of the twelve apostles to die for his faith, as mentioned in the New Testament ([Acts 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts12:1-Acts12:2)).

    James and John's mother was named Salome ([Matthew 27:56](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56); [Mark 15:40](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40)). She may have been a sister of Jesus's mother ([John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). If this is true, it would mean James and John were Jesus's cousins. They might have thought this gave them a special position.
