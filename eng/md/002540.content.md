## Heman (id: 5794)

HEMAN
=====

1\. Lotan’s son, the brother of Hori and a descendant of Seir the Horite ([Gn 36:22](https://ref.ly/Gen36:22)); alternately spelled Homam in [1 Chronicles 1:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:39), reflecting a later scribal error.

2\. Mahol’s son, descendant of Zerah from Judah’s tribe and one of the sages whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon’s ([1 Kgs 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:31); [1 Chr 2:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:6)). He is perhaps the Ezrahite and author of [Psalm 88](https://ref.ly/Ps88:1-Ps88:18).

3\. Kohathite Levite, Joel’s son and one appointed, along with Asaph and Ethan (also called Jeduthun), by David to lead the musicians in the sanctuary ([1 Chr 6:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:33); [15:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17); [16:41](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:41)). During the transport of the ark from Obed\-edom’s house to Jerusalem, he was responsible for sounding the bronze cymbals ([1 Chr 15:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:19); [2 Chr 5:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12)). Heman fathered 14 sons and 3 daughters, all of whom served as musicians in the Lord’s house ([1 Chr 25:1–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:6)). Later, his descendants participated in the cleansing of the temple during King Hezekiah’s reign (715–686 BC; [2 Chr 29:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:14)) and assisted with the Passover celebration initiated by King Josiah (640–609 BC; [2 Chr 35:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:15)).
