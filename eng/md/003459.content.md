## Lemuel (id: 6718)

LEMUEL
======

King credited with writing [Proverbs 31:1–9](https://ref.ly/Prov31:1-Prov31:9). In these verses he sets forth teachings given him by his mother on good government, sexual relations, and wine. Although he has been identified with Solomon, most modern interpreters reject this identification.

* **Associated Passages:** PRO 31:1–PRO 31:9
