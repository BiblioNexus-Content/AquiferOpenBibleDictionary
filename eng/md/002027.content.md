FLOWER
======

A flower is the part of a plant that produces seeds and often has colorful petals. Flowers attract insects or animals, which help the plant spread its seeds.

In the Bible, flowers are sometimes used to symbolize beauty or the shortness of life (for example, [Isaiah 40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Isa40:6-Isa40:8)).
