JAAZANIAH
=========

1\. Son of Hoshaiah, who was a Maacathite and a leader in the armies of Judah at the beginning of the exile. These troops received assurance of safety in return for loyalty to the Babylonians ([2 Kgs 25:23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:23)). Jaazaniah is alternately called Jezaniah in [Jeremiah 40:8](https://ref.ly/Jer40:8) and Azariah in [Jeremiah 42:1](https://ref.ly/Jer42:1) (nlt mg) and [43:2](https://ref.ly/Jer43:2).

3\. Shaphan’s son, who led a group of elders in worshiping idols in the temple ([Ez 8:11](https://ref.ly/Ezek8:11)).

4\. Azzur’s son and one of a group of 25 men seen by Ezekiel in a vision who gave bad counsel and plotted evil in Jerusalem near the time of the exile ([Ez 11:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:1)).
