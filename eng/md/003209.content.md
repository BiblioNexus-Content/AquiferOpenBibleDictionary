## Jotham (id: 6466)

JOTHAM
======

1. The youngest of Gideon’s 70 sons and the only survivor of Abimelech’s murder of Jotham’s brothers at Ophrah ([Judges 9:5](https://ref.ly/Judg9:5)). Upon learning of Abimelech's plan with the Shechemites, Jotham traveled to Shechem. This led to the death of his brothers. He addressed the people from on top of the nearby Mount Gerizim. Using a parable, he showed Abimelech's rise as king. He ended his criticism by cursing his half\-brother ([Judges 8:31](https://ref.ly/Judg8:31)) and the disloyal people of Shechem ([Judges 9:7](https://ref.ly/Judg9:7)). Jotham then fled to Beer because he was worried about Abimelech seeking revenge ([Judges 9:21](https://ref.ly/Judg9:21)). Later, God fulfilled Jotham's curse. The people of Shechem were killed in a revolt. Abimelech was struck down by a woman ([Judges 9:57](https://ref.ly/Judg9:57)).
2. The eleventh king of Judah who reigned from 750 to 735 BC. He was the son of King Azariah (also spelled Uzziah) of Judah and Jerusa, the daughter of Zadok ([2 Kings 15:7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:7); [2 Chronicles 26:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:21); [27:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:1)). He was the father of Ahaz. Jotham, at 25 years of age, ascended Judah’s throne in the second year of King Pekah of Israel and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. At first, he reigned with Azariah, who had leprosy for allowing non\-Jewish worship, until his father's death ([2 Kings 15:5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:5)).

    Jotham was considered a righteous king in the eyes of the Lord. However, he also failed to cleanse the temple of its pagan influences. So the people of Judah continued in their evil ways ([2 Chronicles 27:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:2-2Chr27:6)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:2-2Chr27:6)[6](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:2-2Chr27:6)). He built:

    * The Upper Gate of the temple
        * Part of the wall of Ophel
        * The defenses of numerous towns in Judah’s hill country ([2 Chronicles 27:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3-2Chr27:4)[–](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3-2Chr27:4)[4](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:3-2Chr27:4))
        Jotham also defeated the troublesome Ammonites in battle (v [5](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:5)) and listed the families of Gad living east of the Jordan according to their families ([1 Chronicles 5:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:17)). He was buried in Jerusalem after his death ([2 Chronicles 27:9](https://ref.ly/2Chr27:9)). The prophets Isaiah, Micah, and Hosea were all active during his time as king. Jotham is listed as an ancestor of Jesus Christ in Matthew’s genealogy ([Matthew 1:9](https://ref.ly/Matt1:9)).
