## Mishael (id: 7159)

MISHAEL
=======

1. Uzziel’s son ([Exodus 6:22](https://ref.ly/Exod6:22)). Along with his brother Elzaphan, Moses called him to carry away the bodies of Nadab and Abihu. God had killed Nadab and Abihu because they had not followed God's rules for the altar ([Leviticus 10:1–5](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:5)).
2. One who stood beside Ezra when the law was read ([Nehemiah 8:4](https://ref.ly/Neh8:4)).
3. The Hebrew name for one of Daniel’s friends in Babylon ([Daniel 1:6](https://ref.ly/Dan1:6)). Mishael, Daniel, and two others remained faithful to God ([Daniel 1:11, 19](https://ref.ly/Dan1:11,Dan1:19)). When he refused to follow the king's order, Nebuchadnezzar's men threw him into a fiery furnace. But God saved him from the flames ([Daniel 3](https://ref.ly/Dan3:1-Dan3:30)). His Babylonian name was Meshach ([Daniel 1:7](https://ref.ly/Dan1:7)).
