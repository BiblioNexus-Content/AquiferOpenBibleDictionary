Who Wrote the Book of Habakkuk?
-------------------------------

We know very little about Habakkuk except what we learn from the book of Habakkuk itself. The book calls him a prophet ([Habakkuk 1:1](https://ref.ly/Hab1:1); [3:1](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1)). A prophet was someone who spoke God's messages to the people of Israel.

The prayer of chapter [3](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1-Hab3:19)includes several notes about music ([Habakkuk 3:1, 3, 9, 13, 19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1,Hab3:3,Hab3:9,Hab3:13,Hab3:19)). These musical notes suggest that Habakkuk may have helped with music in the temple. If this is true, he might have been from one of the Levite families (priests who served in the temple). An apocryphal book called Bel and the Dragon mentions Habakkuk as “the son of Jesus of the tribe of Levi,” which might support this idea.

The book shows us that Habakkuk cared deeply about right and wrong. He was troubled by the unfair things happening in his society.

When Was the Book of Habakkuk Written?
--------------------------------------

We cannot be exactly sure when Habakkuk wrote his book, but the text gives us some clues. In [Habakkuk 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/Hab1:5-Hab1:6), Habakkuk talks about God "raising up" the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans were groups of tribes who lived in part of the Assyrian Empire. They often caused problems for their Assyrian rulers.

In 625 BC, the Chaldeans successfully rebelled against Assyrian control. Their leader Nabopolassar became king and ruled from 625 to 605 BC. The Chaldeans then took control of all Babylonia and began to expand their territory.

Many scholars think Habakkuk wrote his prophecy shortly before 625, during the time of King Josiah (who ruled from 640–609 BC). However, [Habakkuk 1:6](https://ref.ly/Hab1:6) might be talking about a later time when the Chaldeans were already known for being fierce warriors. Habakkuk describes the Chaldeans as marching across the world to conquer it ([1:6–8](https://ref.ly/Hab1:6-Hab1:8)). Their reputation for military strength fits better with the time after the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. In this battle, King Nebuchadnezzar II defeated Egypt and made Babylon an important world power. Their reputation might also come from when they captured the city of Nineveh in 612 BC.

The social problems Habakkuk describes seem to match the end of King Josiah's rule. Even though Josiah made many religious reforms after finding the book of the law in the temple ([2 Kings 22:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:8)), Habakkuk says society was full of "destruction and violence" ([Habakkuk 1:3](https://ref.ly/Hab1:3)). The courts were unfair, and good people were being treated badly (verse [4](https://ref.ly/Hab1:4)). 

Since Habakkuk might have been talking about problems in the whole world, not just in Judah, his ministry probably started between 612 and 605 BC. He likely continued preaching during the time of King Jehoiakim, who ruled from 609 to 598 BC.

What Is the Background of the Book of Habakkuk?
-----------------------------------------------

The time after King Josiah's death was one of the most difficult periods in Judah's history. In 612 BC, the Babylonians destroyed the Assyrian city of Nineveh. Within two years, they had removed all remaining Assyrian rule in the region of Mesopotamia.

Egypt, which had been friendly with Assyria, tried to take control of the western parts of the former Assyrian Empire. The Egyptians marched to Carchemish, an important city on the Euphrates River. King Josiah tried to stop them but died in the battle.

The Egyptians then made Jehoiakim king instead of Jehoahaz, who should have been the next king after Josiah. Jehoiakim had to do what Egypt wanted, and the people of Judah were forced to pay heavy taxes. During this time, many people's faith began to weaken. The religious reforms under Josiah had not brought blessings to the nation. Instead, they had lost their freedom. Society changed from being fairly stable to being full of oppression and violence (see [Jeremiah 22:17](https://ref.ly/Jer22:17)).

In 604 BC, the Babylonians moved into the Syro\-Palestinian area, meeting little resistance. King Jehoiakim switched his loyalty to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who kept moving south. When Pharaoh Neco's army fought against the Babylonians, both sides lost many soldiers and Nebuchadnezzar went back to Babylon. Jehoiakim then changed sides again and supported Egypt. In 598 BC, the Babylonians returned to Syro\-Palestine, starting a campaign that would end with Jerusalem's fall in 586 BC.

Why Was the Book of Habakkuk Written? What Does It Teach About God?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Book of Habakkuk helps us understand two main things: 

* how God's people should think about evil in the world, and
* how God brings justice when people do wrong.

Habakkuk asks important questions about how God works in history. These might be his own questions or questions that other people were asking. For example, he asks why God seems to do nothing while evil continues. God answers that he punishes evil in his own time and way.

The book shows that evil does not win forever. Throughout history, evil rulers and nations have fallen. People who trust God should look at history with faith, believing that God rules in a right way.

While the book does not explain why God allows evil to exist, it teaches that faithful people will see God's work in history through the perspective of faith. In Chapter [3](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1-Hab3:19), Habakkuk looks back at history and describes how God has helped his people.

One of the most important ideas in the book is that God controls everything that happens. Even nations that do not follow God are under God's control. Nations rise and fall not by chance, but because God allows it to happen.

What Is the Message of the Book of Habakkuk?
--------------------------------------------

### Habakkuk's First Question and God's Answer ([1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Hab1:1-Hab1:11))

The book begins with Habakkuk asking God some hard questions. He sees many wrong things happening in his society and asks God how long he will let this continue. Many people ask this same question when they see evil in a world governed by God, who is in control. 

God's answer surprised Habakkuk. God said he was already doing something about the evil in the world. God was sending the Chaldeans to punish the people of Judah. The Bible describes the Chaldeans as a powerful army that destroys everything in its path ([Habakkuk 1:6–11](https://ref.ly/Hab1:6-Hab1:11)). This answer troubled Habakkuk. He wondered why God would use such cruel people to accomplish his purposes. 

Habakkuk's first question leads to several other questions. Why does God seem to ignore the problem of evil? Why does God allow it to continue? It often seems that God does not respond when people expect him to. 

When God does respond, he reveals that he will use the Babylonians to punish the evil in Judah. Habakkuk's prayer was answered, but it was not what he expected. Instead of using a righteous nation, God would use a hated and evil nation to address the wrongs of his own people. Though this was confusing for Habakkuk, he was comforted by the fact that God was still in control of history ([Habakkuk 1:5–6](https://ref.ly/Hab1:5-Hab1:6)). God governs the rise and fall of nations, using even evil nations to accomplish his will.

### Habakkuk's Second Question and God's Answer ([1:12–2:5](https://ref.ly/Hab1:12-Hab2:5))

Habakkuk’s first question was not fully answered by God’s first response. He accepted that God was using the Babylonians to punish Judah's sins ([Habakkuk 1:12](https://ref.ly/Hab1:12)). But he asks God another question: “You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate the faithless? Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?” ([Habakkuk 1:13](https://ref.ly/Hab1:13)). Habakkuk suggests that God sees what the evil Chaldeans do but does not punish them for their wrongs. Habakkuk still cannot understand how God can use an evil nation to punish his own people.

But Habakkuk did learn something important from God's first answer. He began by saying that God is eternal, unlike the Babylonians who only trusted in their military strength: “O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O LORD” ([Habakkuk 1:12](https://ref.ly/Hab1:12)). The prophet was probably thinking about the previous verse, which contrasts the Chaldeans’ reliance on their own military strength with Judah’s God, who is eternal and steadfast.

Habakkuk's problem was still not resolved. Next, he described the Chaldeans as aggressive, comparing them to fishermen who capture people in their nets and then worship their nets ([Habakkuk 1:15–16](https://ref.ly/Hab1:15-Hab1:16)). He asked God if the Chaldeans would continue to destroy other nations ([Habakkuk 1:17](https://ref.ly/Hab1:17)).

After asking these questions, Habakkuk waited for God's answer ([Habakkuk 2:1](https://ref.ly/Hab2:1)). God told him to write down the answer clearly because it was important, though it would not happen right away ([Habakkuk 2:2](https://ref.ly/Hab2:2), [3](https://ref.ly/Hab2:3)).

Then God gave one of the most important verses in the Old Testament about faith: "but the righteous will live by faith" ([Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4)). This verse became central to Paul’s teachings and the Protestant Reformation. Paul cited [Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4) when discussing justification by faith ([Romans 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17); [Galatians 3:11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:11)). This passage was also important in the New Testament book of Hebrews ([Hebrews 10:38–39](https://ref.ly/Heb10:38-Heb10:39)).

In the Old Testament, "faith" means "firmness” or "strength." The word is used to describe things that give strong support, like door posts ([2 Kings 18:16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:16); [Isaiah 22:23](https://ref.ly/Isa22:23)). When referring to God, it means faithfulness or unwavering commitment to his promises. For people, it means completely trusting in God and his promises. In the Old Testament, faith means actively trusting and following God. It is not just an idea. Faith means truly committing to God with your whole heart. This kind of faith shows itself through trust in God rather than through following religious rules.

In [Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4), God says that righteous people will live by keeping their trust in God strong, even during difficult times. Jesus shared this teaching in his story (the parable of the sower) about seeds growing in different kinds of soil ([Matthew 13:21](https://ref.ly/Matt13:21)). James also wrote about staying faithful during difficult times ([James 1:12](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12)).

God's answer to Habakkuk was clear: God does punish evil but in his own time and way. People who truly trust God will keep believing even when evil is not quickly punished. True faith means trusting that God rules the world in the right way.

### A Taunt\-Song Celebrating the Defeat of the Chaldeans ([2:6–20](https://ref.ly/Jas2:6-Jas2:20))

After suggesting the Chaldeans would decline and be defeated, Habakkuk writes a taunt\-song (meant to humiliate the Chaldeans) about what will happen to them. His words came true when the Medes and Persians later defeated the Babylonian Empire.

In his taunt\-song, Habakkuk says that Babylon’s "creditors" will rise against her ([Habakkuk 2:7](https://ref.ly/Hab2:7)). This suggests that other nations will suddenly appear to destroy Babylon. Babylon will be defeated because of how they treated other nations. [Habakkuk 2:8](https://ref.ly/Hab2:8) says: "Because you have plundered many nations, the remnant of the people will plunder you." The Old Testament principle of retributive justice teaches that God's justice applies to everyone, not just his followers.

King Nebuchadnezzar built many buildings in Babylon, but Habakkuk says even these buildings cry out against the cruel way they were built ([Habakkuk 2:9–12](https://ref.ly/Hab2:9-Hab2:12)).

Habakkuk speaks against the Chaldeans because of their extreme cruelty but also because of their shameful treatment of captive peoples. He uses a vivid metaphor to illustrate this, comparing it to making people drunk to expose their shame ([Habakkuk 2:15](https://ref.ly/Hab2:15)).

At the end of his song, Habakkuk criticizes the Chaldeans for worshipping idols made of wood and stone ([Habakkuk 2:18–19](https://ref.ly/Hab2:18-Hab2:19)). The Chaldeans, like other pagan peoples, believed their success came from these idols. But, since idols are powerless to help them, Babylon will fall.

Habakkuk ends with a powerful contrast: while people worship lifeless idols, the true God is alive in his temple. He tells everyone to be quiet and wait for God's judgment to come. “But the LORD is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him” ([Habakkuk 2:20](https://ref.ly/Hab2:20)). God is real and God is in control. Habakkuk tells everyone to be quiet and wait for God's judgment to come.

### The Prayer of Habakkuk ([3:1–19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1-Hab3:19))

The prophecy of Habakkuk ends with a prayer that is like some Old Testament psalms. This prayer includes a title ([Habakkuk 3:1](https://ref.ly/Hab3:1)) and several musical notations.

Some scholars argue that this chapter might not originally belong to Habakkuk. They think it could have been added in the postexilic period (after the Jews returned from living in Babylon) because it seems different from the rest of the book. However, it is also possible that the prophet himself, or a scribe working for him, added the psalm to his collection of prophecies. The musical notations in this chapter do not mean the prayer had to be written in a later period because many early psalms have similar musical notations.

The prayer matches Habakkuk's earlier messages. It talks about how God will judge his enemies ([Habakkuk 3:16](https://ref.ly/Hab3:16)), and praises God who is in control ([Habakkuk 3:3](https://ref.ly/Hab3:3)). These are the main ideas of the earlier chapters.

This prayer shows how much Habakkuk's faith has grown. Earlier, he questioned how God was working in the world. Now, after seeing how God works in history, his faith has become strong and certain.
