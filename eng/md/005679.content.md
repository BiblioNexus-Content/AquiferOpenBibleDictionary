## Trinity (id: 8928)

TRINITY
=======

The term designating the three members of the triune God: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Bible does not use the word "Trinity." Scholars created it to describe the three members of the Godhead. The Bible presents God as Father, Son, and Spirit. They are not three "gods," but three personas of the one true God (see, for example, [Matthew 28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19); [1 Corinthians 16:23](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:23-1Cor16:24)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:23-1Cor16:24)[24](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:23-1Cor16:24); [2 Corinthians 13:13](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:13)). 

**The Father** is the source of creation, the giver of life, and the God of the universe (see [John 5:26](https://ref.ly/John5:26); [1 Corinthians 8:6](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:6); [Ephesians 3:14–15](https://ref.ly/Eph3:14-Eph3:15)). 

**The Son** is the image of the invisible God. He is the exact representation of his being and nature. He is the Messiah\-Redeemer (see [Philippians 2:5](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:6); [Colossians 1:14](https://ref.ly/Col1:14-Col1:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Col1:14-Col1:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Col1:14-Col1:16); [Hebrews 1:1](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:3)). 

**The Spirit** is God in action. The Spirit is God reaching and influencing people. The Spirit regenerates, infills, and guides them (see [John 14:26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [Galatians 4:6](https://ref.ly/Gal4:6); [Ephesians 2:18](https://ref.ly/Eph2:18)). 

They are a tri\-unity. They inhabit and work together to fulfill the divine design in the universe (see [John 16:13](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:15)[–](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:15)[15](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:15)).
