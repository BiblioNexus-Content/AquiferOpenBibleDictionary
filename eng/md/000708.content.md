## Balak (id: 3978)

BALAK
=====

Zippor’s son, and king of Moab. Balak was afraid after the Israelites defeated the Amorites, so he hired a prophet named Balaam to curse Israel ([Numbers 22:1](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num22:7)[–](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num22:7)[7](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num22:7)). Balak escorted Balaam to three different mountains and offered three different sacrifices. But each time Balaam delivered a blessing to the Israelites instead ([Numbers 22–24](https://ref.ly/Num22:1-Num24:25)). Enraged, Balak sent Balaam away. That event was given as an example of God’s special blessing on the Israelites and the pointlessness of trying to change God’s will ([Joshua 24:9](https://ref.ly/Josh24:9-Josh24:10)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh24:9-Josh24:10)[10](https://ref.ly/Josh24:9-Josh24:10); [Judges 11:25](https://ref.ly/Judg11:25); [Micah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Mic6:5); [Revelation 2:14](https://ref.ly/Rev2:14)).
