## Bethuel, Bethul (Place) (id: 4208)

BETHUEL, BETHUL (Place)
=======================

One of the cities given to Simeon’s tribe within Judah’s land ([1 Chr 4:30](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:30)). Bethuel is also called Bethul in [Joshua 19:4](https://ref.ly/Josh19:4), and is perhaps the same as Chesil or Kesil, a city given to Judah’s tribe ([Joshua 15:30](https://ref.ly/Josh15:30)). It may also be the same as Bethel in the Negev, to which David sent gifts ([1 Samuel 30:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:27)). 

*See* Kesil.
