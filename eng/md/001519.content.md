## David, Root of (id: 4767)

DAVID\*, Root of
================

Phrase applied to Jesus Christ in the book of Revelation ([Rv 5:5](https://ref.ly/Rev5:5); [22:16](https://ref.ly/Rev22:16)). Though “root” usually means “source,” the metaphor depicts Jesus as David’s royal descendant, as indicated by the parallel word “offspring” in [Revelation 22:16](https://ref.ly/Rev22:16). That is, Jesus came from King David’s family as a branch grows from a rooted tree (cf. [Is 11:1](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1)).
