## Sephar (id: 8230)

SEPHAR
======

A geographical landmark. It defines one of the boundaries of the territory settled by the sons of Joktan ([Genesis 10:30](https://ref.ly/Gen10:30)). There is no doubt it is in southern Arabia. Sephar is most often identified with one of two towns bearing the Arabic name Zafar. One is the seaport town in the Hadhramaut province of central Yemen. The other is the site in southern Yemen, once the capital of the Himyarites.
