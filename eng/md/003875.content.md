## Milcom (id: 7134)

MILCOM
======

The national god of the Ammonites. He is better known as Molech or Moloch. The worship of this false god included the terrible practice of sacrificing children in fire. This type of worship was strictly forbidden to the Israelites ([Leviticus 18:21](https://ref.ly/Lev18:21); [Jeremiah 32:35](https://ref.ly/Jer32:35)). 

King Solomon built a place to worship Milcom ([1 Kings 11:5, 33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:5,1Kgs11:33)). Later, King Josiah destroyed this site ([2 Kings 23:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:13)). Milcom is translated as "king" in [2 Samuel 12:30](https://ref.ly/2Sam12:30) and [1 Chronicles 20:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:2).
