## Shebarim (id: 8316)

SHEBARIM\*
==========

Location between Ai and Jericho to which the men of Ai pursued the fleeing Israelites. This region was evidently situated near the place of descent from the hill country to the lowlands ([Jos 7:5](https://ref.ly/Josh7:5), see nlt mg). Shebarim means “breaches” or “ruins” and might possibly refer to the rough, rocky conditions that would characterize the region at the top of a steep mountain slope. Its location is unknown.
