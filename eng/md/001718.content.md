## Elath (id: 4968)

ELATH
=====

Elath (also spelled Eloth) was a city in the land of Edom. It was at the top of the Gulf of Aqaba, near the eastern edge of the wilderness of El\-paran ([Genesis 14:6](https://ref.ly/Gen14:6); [Deuteronomy 2:8](https://ref.ly/Deut2:8); [1 Kings 9:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26)). The name *Elath* means “grove of trees.” It may have been named for the many palm trees in the area. Some people think it was located in a group of sacred trees.

Elath was on an important trade route. Traders traveled through it on their way between southern Arabia, Egypt, and Phoenicia. Because of this, it was a valuable city.

At one point, Kedorlaomer defeated the Horites and took control of Elath ([Genesis 14:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen14:5-Gen14:6)). Later, Elath became the southern border of Edom ([Deuteronomy 2:8](https://ref.ly/Deut2:8)). King David probably took Elath when he defeated Edom ([2 Samuel 8:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam8:14)). 

During the time of King Joram, the son of Jehoshaphat, the Edomites took Elath back ([2 Kings 8:20–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:20-2Kgs8:22)). A few years later, King Uzziah of Judah recaptured and rebuilt the city ([2 Kings 14:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:22)). Judah kept control of Elath until the time of King Ahaz. Then Rezin, the king of Syria, captured it and the Syrians took control ([2 Kings 16:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs16:6)). 

After about 753 BC, Elath became part of Edom again. It stayed that way until sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, when it was abandoned. Later, the Nabateans built a new city a little east of the old one and named it Aila.
