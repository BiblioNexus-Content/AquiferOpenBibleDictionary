## Zered (id: 9194)

ZERED
=====

Valley and brook by which the Israelites encamped, listed between Iye\-abarim and a stopping place near the Arnon River to the north ([Nm 21:12](https://ref.ly/Num21:12)). Though its exact location remains in question, Zered is probably identifiable with the modern Wadi el\-Hesa, a streambed that formed a natural border between the ancient countries of Moab and Edom and, following a northwestward course, emptied into the southern end of the Dead Sea. The crossing of the Zered Brook by the Israelites marked 38 years since Israel rebelled against God at Kadesh\-barnea ([Dt 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Deut2:13-Deut2:14)).
