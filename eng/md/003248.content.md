## Justus (id: 6505)

JUSTUS
======

1. A family name for Joseph Barsabbas ([Acts 1:23](https://ref.ly/Acts1:23)).

    *See* Joseph \#12.

2. A godly Corinthian man. He was probably a convert of the apostle Paul. Justus opened his home to Paul and other Christians after the Jewish synagogue leaders would not allow Paul to continue preaching there ([Acts 18:7](https://ref.ly/Acts18:7)). The ancient manuscripts of the Bible do not all agree on his exact name. Some versions call him Justus while others call him Titius Justus. Some scholars think he might be the same person as Gaius mentioned in [Romans 16:23](https://ref.ly/Rom16:23).
3. A family name of a believer named Jesus, a Jewish Christian ([Colossians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Col4:11)).

    *See* Jesus \#3.
