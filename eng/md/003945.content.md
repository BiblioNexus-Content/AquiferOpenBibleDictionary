## Moresheth-Gath (id: 7204)

MORESHETH\-GATH
===============

Town in the lowland country of Judah included in Micah’s lament ([Mi 1:14](https://ref.ly/Mic1:14)); perhaps the same as Moresheth, Micah’s hometown. The “gath” in Moresheth\-gath suggests that the town was in close proximity to the major Philistine city by that name. Its exact location is uncertain. Jerome (a fourth\-century AD church father) suggested that Moresheth\-gath was situated a short distance east of Eleutheropolis, identifiable with modern Khirbet el\-Basel. Another possible site is Tell ej\-Judeideh, six miles (9\.7 kilometers) southeast of Gath.
