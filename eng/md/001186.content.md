## Caspin (id: 4442)

CASPIN
======

Caspin was a town east of the Jordan River. It was probably the same place as Chaspho ([1 Maccabees 5:26, 36](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:26,1Macc5:36)). Ancient and modern experts do not fully agree on the location. The Jewish historian Josephus identifies Caspin with Maked ([2 Maccabees 12:13](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:13)). In [1 Maccabees 5:24–36](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:24-1Macc5:36), Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus led their army into the region called Transjordan (across the Jordan River). There Judas “took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilead” (verse[36](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:36), Revised Standard Version).
