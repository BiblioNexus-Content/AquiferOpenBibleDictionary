## Soothsayer (id: 8577)

SOOTHSAYER\*
============

One who foretells events; a pagan practice, soothsaying was forbidden in Israel ([Dt 18:10, 14](https://ref.ly/Deut18:10,Deut18:14)). In Scripture, soothsaying was practiced by Balaam, Beor’s son ([Jos 13:22](https://ref.ly/Josh13:22)) and King Manasseh of Judah ([2 Kgs 21:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:6); [2 Chr 33:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:6)); Jacob’s descendants were likened to the soothsayers of Philistia ([Is 2:6](https://ref.ly/Isa2:6)); they were listed among the false prophets of Judah ([Jer 27:9](https://ref.ly/Jer27:9)). During NT times, soothsaying was the source of a lucrative trade in Philippi ([Acts 16:16](https://ref.ly/Acts16:16)).
