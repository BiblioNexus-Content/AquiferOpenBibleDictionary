MELON
=====

A melon is a fruit with many seeds that belongs to the gourd family. Several types of these related vine plants have a hard outer skin and juicy flesh inside.

The melons mentioned in [Numbers 11:5](https://ref.ly/Num11:5) could be either the muskmelon (*Cucumis melo*) or the watermelon (*Citrullus vulgaris*). It is possible this verse refers to both of these fruits.
