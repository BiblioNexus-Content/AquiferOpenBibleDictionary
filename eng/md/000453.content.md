## Archevites (id: 3717)

ARCHEVITES
==========

The King James Version translation for the residents of Erech (also spelled Uruk) in southern Babylonia. The Archevites were moved to Samaria by Asnappar, the Assyrian King Ashurbanipal ([Ezra 4:9–10](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:9-Ezra4:10)). The Archevites were local residents. They wrote to Artaxerxes of Persia, opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem by the Jews who had returned from exile in Babylon ([Ezra 4:7–16](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:7-Ezra4:16)).
