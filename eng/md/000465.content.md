## Argob (Person) (id: 3730)

ARGOB (Person)
==============

A person who was supposedly killed with King Pekahiah of Israel in Pekah’s revolt ([2 Kings 15:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:25)). The early church father Jerome thought the name Argob (along with Arieh) referred to a place. Today, some scholars think that Argob and Arieh may have been accidentally misplaced from a list of place names ([2 Kings 15:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:29)) through transcription error.
