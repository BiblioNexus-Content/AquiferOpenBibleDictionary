BOWELS
======

The word *bowels* means the intestines (the lower part of the stomach area). The King James Version also uses this word as a metaphor to describe the place where a person feels pity, mercy, and tenderness (see [Philippians 1:8](https://ref.ly/Phil1:8); [2:1–2](https://ref.ly/Phil2:1-Phil2:2)).
