## Abihail (id: 3298)

ABIHAIL
=======

A name used for both men and women in the Old Testament.

1. Zuriel’s father and a leader of the Merari family of Levites during Israel’s wandering in the wilderness ([Numbers 3:35](https://ref.ly/Num3:35)).
2. Abishur’s wife and mother of Ahban and Molid ([1 Chronicles 2:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:29)).
3. Huri’s son, a descendant of Gad, who lived in Gilead and Bashan ([1 Chronicles 5:14](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:14)).
4. A woman named in [2 Chronicles 11:18\.](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:18) Her relationship to King Rehoboam is not clear. In some translations, Abihail seems to be the second wife of Rehoboam. However, only one wife is listed at first. Abihail was probably the mother of Rehoboam’s first wife, Mahalath. So, Abihail was a daughter of Eliab, David’s eldest brother. She married her cousin Jerimoth, one of David’s sons.
5. Esther’s father, and uncle of Mordecai ([Esther 2:15](https://ref.ly/Esth2:15); [9:29](https://ref.ly/Esth9:29)).
