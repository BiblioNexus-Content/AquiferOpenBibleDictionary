## Hamath, Entrance of (id: 5614)

HAMATH\*, Entrance of
=====================

Place of uncertain identification, marking the northern border of the Canaanite territory promised to Israel by God ([Nm 34:8](https://ref.ly/Num34:8)), but only attained by the time of the monarchy ([1 Kgs 8:65](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:65); [1 Chr 13:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:5); [2 Chr 7:8](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:8)).

After the death of Solomon, the kingdom was divided and the northern boundary shrank. It was not until the reign of Jeroboam II, son of Joash (793–753 BC), king of the northern kingdom (called Israel), that the northern boundaries extended again to the entrance of Hamath ([2 Kgs 14:23–25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:23-2Kgs14:25)).

Both Amos and Ezekiel refer to the entrance of Hamath in their prophecies concerning Israel ([Am 6:14](https://ref.ly/Amos6:14); [Ez 47:15–20](https://ref.ly/Ezek47:15-Ezek47:20); [48:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:1)). Some authorities regard the place as the ancient town Lebo\-hamath, identified with modern Lebweh. *See* Hamath \#1; Lebo\-hamath.
