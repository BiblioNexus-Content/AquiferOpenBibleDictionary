## Bramble (id: 4325)

BRAMBLE
=======

The Palestinian bramble (*Rubus sanctus*) and the closely related elm\-leaf bramble (*Rubus ulmifolius*) are prickly evergreen shrubs that spread by growing new shoots from their roots. The stems and young shoots are covered with a characteristic whitish powder or bloom and short hairs. The prickles are strong, stand upright, and have hair on them.

The flowers of these brambles can be white, pink, rose, or purple in color. The fruit is round and black. In the Bible, "bramble" is a translation of several different words that describe shrubs with prickly stems and runners. These plants often form tangled masses of vegetation.
