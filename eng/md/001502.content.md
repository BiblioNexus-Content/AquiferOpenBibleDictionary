## Dan-jaan (id: 4749)

DAN\-JAAN
=========

A place that marked the northern border of King David's kingdom ([2 Samuel 24:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:6)). This is where Joab stopped when he was counting the people for David's census.

Some scholars think this name might be a copying mistake, since no town with a similar name is known to have existed in that area. Others believe it means "Dan in the wood," and is simply referring to the city of Dan (see Revised Standard Version). Still others think it might be a town within the territory of Dan, possibly called Jaan, but all traces of this town have disappeared over time.
