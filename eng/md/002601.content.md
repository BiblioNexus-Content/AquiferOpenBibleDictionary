## Hill Country of the Amorites (id: 3571)

HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES
============================

The central mountainous region between the plains of Philistia, Sharon, and Phoenicia on the west and the valley of the Jordan on the east. While the King James Version uses “mount,” most modern translations use “hill country.” The phrase is not for a single mountain but identifies a range running north and south through Judah and Ephraim ([Deuteronomy 1:7, 19–20](https://ref.ly/Deut1:7,Deut1:19-Deut1:20)).

* **Associated Passages:** DEU 1:7; DEU 1:19–DEU 1:20
