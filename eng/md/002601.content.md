## Hill Country of the Amalekites (id: 3536)

HILL COUNTRY OF THE AMALEKITES
==============================

An area near Pirathon in Ephraim, probably about 9\.6 kilometers (six miles) west of Shechem ([Judges 12:15](https://ref.ly/Judg12:15)). It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible but not in the Greek manuscripts of the Old Testament. Some scholars find the reference confusing. However, it is possible that an argument based on [Judges 5:14](https://ref.ly/Judg5:14) and [12:15](https://ref.ly/Judg12:15) can be made that there was a small Amalekite district in Ephraim.

The hill country of the Amalekites is sometimes called the "mount of the Amalekites."
