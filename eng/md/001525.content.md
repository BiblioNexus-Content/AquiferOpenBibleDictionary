## Day of the Lord (id: 4772)

DAY OF THE LORD
===============

An expression used by Old Testament prophets to describe a time when God will intervene in history, mainly for judgment. Thus, “the day of the Lord” is also called “the Day of the LORD’s anger” ([Zephaniah 2:2](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:2)). This expression appears in the writings of the prophet Amos, who lived during the eighth century BC.

The Day of the Lord in the Old Testament
----------------------------------------

Sometimes, “the day of the Lord” is used in the Old Testament to refer to a previous judgment ([Lamentations 2:22](https://ref.ly/Lam2:22)). However, it usually refers to a future judgment ([Joel 2:1–11](https://ref.ly/Joel2:1-Joel2:11)). Specifically, it refers to the final judgment of the world ([Joel 3:14–21](https://ref.ly/Joel3:14-Joel3:21); [Malachi 4:5](https://ref.ly/Mal4:5)). Often, a prophecy about an event in the near future is combined with an end\-time prophecy—a coming judgment is a preview of the final Day of the Lord. Isaiah's prophecy against Babylon in [Isaiah 13](https://ref.ly/Isa13:5-Isa13:10) is an example ([Isaiah 13:5–10](https://ref.ly/Isa13:5-Isa13:10)). Jesus used many prophecies to explain his second coming ([Mark 13:24–37](https://ref.ly/Mark13:24-Mark13:37)). 

Another example is Joel’s prophecy of the Day of the Lord ([Joel 1:15–2:11](https://ref.ly/Joel1:15-Joel2:11)). The prophet predicted a plague of locusts God would send to Israel, but his prophecy extended to the Day of the Lord after Joel’s time ([Joel 2:14–17, 31](https://ref.ly/Joel2:14-Joel2:17,Joel2:31)). The Day of the Lord was even after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, which was also predicted by Joel’s prophecy ([Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32); [Acts 2:16–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:16-Acts2:21); [Revelation 6:12–13](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12-Rev6:13)). The New Testament only uses the term to mean the end times.

The Day of the Lord is described as a day of gloom, darkness, and judgment. It is connected to God’s judgment and describes changes in nature, such as the darkening of the sun, moon, and stars ([Isaiah 13:10](https://ref.ly/Isa13:10); [Joel 2:31](https://ref.ly/Joel2:31); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Joel3:15); [Matthew 24:29](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29); [Revelation 6:12](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12)). Nations will be judged for their rebellion against Israel ([Joel 3:19](https://ref.ly/Joel3:19); compare [Psalm 2](https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:12)). However, Israel is told not to be eager for that day because they will also be judged ([Amos 5:18–20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)). But the prophets promise that a faithful “remnant” will be saved when they turn to the Messiah ([Joel 2:32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:32); [Zechariah 12:10](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10)). After the judgment is a time of prosperity, restoration, and blessing for Israel ([Joel 3:18–21](https://ref.ly/Joel3:18-Joel3:21)).

The Day of the Lord in the New Testament
----------------------------------------

There are more explicit expressions in the New Testament:

* “The day of our Lord Jesus Christ” ([1 Corinthians 1:8](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:8))
* “The day of the Lord Jesus” ([1 Corinthians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5); [2 Corinthians 1:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:14))
* “The day of Christ” ([Philemon 1:10](https://ref.ly/Phil1:10); [2:16](https://ref.ly/Phil2:16))

These are more personal and positive. They refer to final events for Christian believers, who will not experience God's wrath ([1 Thessalonians 5:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:9)). When the Day of the Lord comes, the earth will be renewed and purified with fire ([2 Peter 3:10–13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10-2Pet3:13)). In Revelation, this final purification comes after the Millennium—that is, the 1,000\-year reign of Christ ([Revelation 21:1](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1)).
