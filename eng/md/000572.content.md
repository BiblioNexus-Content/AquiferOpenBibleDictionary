## Assurance (id: 3838)

ASSURANCE
=========

Being sure or confident about what you believe or do. 

The "assurance of hope" ("make your hope sure" in the Berean Standard Bible; [Hebrews 6:11](https://ref.ly/Heb6:11)) and the "assurance of faith" ([Hebrews 10:22](https://ref.ly/Heb10:22); [11:1](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1)) are mentioned as qualities of wholeness that help believers live responsibly. 

Paul spoke of an "assured understanding" of the gospel of Christ, which resulted in love in the community ("complete understanding"; [Colossians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Col2:2)). He also spoke of the "assured blessing" which was his in Christ ("fullness of the blessing" in the Berean Standard Bible; [Romans 15:29](https://ref.ly/Rom15:29)).
