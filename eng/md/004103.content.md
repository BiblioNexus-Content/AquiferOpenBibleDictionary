## Ner (id: 7369)

NER
===

A man from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the father of Abner and brother of Kish. This would make Ner the uncle of King Saul ([1 Samuel 14:51](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51); [26:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam26:5); [2 Samuel 2:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8); [1 Kings 2:32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:32); [1 Chronicles 26:28](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:28)). 

However, the Bible gives different information about Ner's family relationships. In one passage, the Bible says that Ner's father was named Abiel ([1 Samuel 14:51](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:51)). But other passages list Ner as one of the sons of Jeiel, though these readings are difficult to interpret ([1 Chronicles 8:29–30](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:29-1Chr8:30); [9:35–36](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35-1Chr9:36)). In other parts of the Bible, Ner is listed as the father of Kish, who was the father of Saul ([8:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:33); [9:39](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:39)). This would make Ner the grandfather of Saul.

One possible explanation is that there were two different men named Kish. One Kish was Ner's brother, and the other was Ner's son. Another explanation is that there were two different men named Ner. 

These different explanations show that family lists in the Bile are sometimes incomplete or unclear.
