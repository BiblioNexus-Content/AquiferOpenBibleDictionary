## Adoni-Bezek (id: 3390)

ADONI\-BEZEK
============

The title of the Canaanite king of Bezek, a city in northern Palestine. After Joshua died, the tribes of Judah and Simeon defeated Adoni\-bezek and cut off his thumbs and big toes. Adoni\-bezek had done the same thing to many kings he had captured. He admitted that what happened to him was a just punishment from God ([Judges 1:5](https://ref.ly/Judg1:5-Judg1:7)–[7](https://ref.ly/Judg1:5-Judg1:7)). Some argue that Adoni\-bezek and Adoni\-zedek, who is mentioned in [Joshua 10:1,](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1) were the same person.
