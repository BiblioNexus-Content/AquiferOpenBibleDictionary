## Japhia (Person) (id: 6215)

JAPHIA (Person)
===============

1. A king of the city of Lachish. He joined with four other Amorite kings to attack Gibeon because Gibeon had made a peace treaty with the Israelites. Joshua led the Israelites to defeat these five kings completely at the battle of Beth\-horon. During this battle, God helped the Israelites by sending large hailstones and by making the sun stand still. Japhia and the four kings hid in a cave at Makkedah. But Joshua discovered them. He then had them killed and hung on trees ([Joshua 10:3–27](https://ref.ly/Josh10:3-Josh10:27)).
2. A son born to David while he was king in Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 5:15](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:15); [1 Chronicles 3:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:7); [14:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr14:6)).
