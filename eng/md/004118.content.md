## New Birth (id: 4252)

NEW BIRTH
=========

A way of receiving "spiritual life" and becoming part of the kingdom of God. 

Jesus spoke about new birth when he talked with a man named Nicodemus ([John 3:3–7](https://ref.ly/John3:3-John3:7)). Jesus said that people must be "born again" to see the kingdom of God. This new birth does not come from human parents. It comes from God’s Spirit.

New birth is also called *regeneration* (a word that means being made new). It happens when God gives someone a new heart and a new spirit.

*See* Regeneration.
