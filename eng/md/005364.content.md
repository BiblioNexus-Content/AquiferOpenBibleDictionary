## Stocks (id: 8625)

STOCKS
======

A common form of punishment and confinement in Bible times ([2 Chronicles 16:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:10); [Acts 16:24](https://ref.ly/Acts16:24)). Stocks were wooden frames with holes for locking a prisoner's feet, hands, or neck. This prevented movement and caused great discomfort.
