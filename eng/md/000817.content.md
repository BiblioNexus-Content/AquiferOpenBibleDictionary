## Belial, Beliar (id: 4087)

BELIAL, BELIAR
==============

A common Hebrew noun meaning “baseness,” “worthlessness,” “wickedness,” or “lawlessness.” Belial, however, is often translated as a name. Thus, sometimes it is translated as “sons of Belial” ([Judges 19:22](https://ref.ly/Judg19:22); [1 Samuel 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12)), “daughter of Belial” ([1 Samuel 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:16)), or “children of Belial” ([Deuteronomy 13:13](https://ref.ly/Deut13:13); [Judges 20:13](https://ref.ly/Judg20:13)). Newer translations generally translate it as “worthless rabble” or "worthless” ([Deuteronomy 13:13](https://ref.ly/Deut13:13); [Judges 19:22](https://ref.ly/Judg19:22); [20:13](https://ref.ly/Judg20:13); [1 Samuel 1:16](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:16); [2:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:12); [10:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:27); [Proverbs 6:12](https://ref.ly/Prov6:12)). One exception is in [Nahum 1:15](https://ref.ly/Nah1:15), which some scholars think should be translated “Belial.” This is a personal name of the Assyrian conqueror who threatened to the southern kingdom of Judah.

Texts from between the two Testaments use “Belial” as a name and influenced how it is used in the New Testament. In the New Testament, the term appears once as “Belial” (or Beliar in [2 Corinthians 6:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:15)) and is identified with Satan, the representation of evil. Nonbiblical writings from the New Testament period often used Belial as a name for Satan or the Antichrist.
