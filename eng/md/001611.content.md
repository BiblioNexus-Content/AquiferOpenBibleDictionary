## Dish (id: 4863)

DISH
====

A vessel, usually made of baked clay or metal, used in everyday life and in religious ceremony. Dishes were used to serve or preserve food ([Judges 5:25](https://ref.ly/Judg5:25); [Matthew 26:23](https://ref.ly/Matt26:23); [Mark 14:20](https://ref.ly/Mark14:20)). They had to be wiped and left to dry ([2 Kings 21:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:13)). Later the Pharisees (a Jewish religious group active in the New Testament period) added a ritual cleansing as well ([Matthew 23:25–26](https://ref.ly/Matt23:25-Matt23:26); [Luke 11:39](https://ref.ly/Luke11:39)). Dishes were used in connection with the meal offering ([Numbers 7:13](https://ref.ly/Num7:13)). Dishes were also used with the table of showbread for worship in the Old Testament tabernacle and temple ([Exodus 25:29](https://ref.ly/Exod25:29); [37:16](https://ref.ly/Exod37:16); [Numbers 4:7](https://ref.ly/Num4:7)).
