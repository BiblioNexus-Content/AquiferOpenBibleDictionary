## Dishan (id: 4861)

DISHAN
======

Chieftain in the land of Seir, a mountainous area southwest of the Dead Sea. Dishan’s father was Seir the Horite ([Gn 36:21](https://ref.ly/Gen36:21); [1 Chr 1:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:38)). The Horites were driven out of their territory by the Edomites ([Dt 2:12](https://ref.ly/Deut2:12)). Later OT references often use Seir and Edom synonymously.
