## Cain (Person) (id: 4383)

CAIN (Person)
=============

The first son of Adam and Eve. He became a tiller of the soil while his brother, Abel, was a keeper of sheep. When people talk about terrible acts of violence, they often mention Cain's murder of his brother Abel as an example ([Jude 1:11](https://ref.ly/Jude1:11)). Each of the two brothers had brought a sacrifice to the Lord ([Genesis 4:3–4](https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:4)). According to [Hebrews 11:4](https://ref.ly/Heb11:4), Abel had acted in faith by bringing a more acceptable sacrifice than that of Cain. Cain became very angry because God did not accept his offering. Because God accepted Abel's offering but not his own, Cain killed his brother ([Genesis 4:5–8](https://ref.ly/Gen4:5-Gen4:8)). 

When explaining why Cain acted with violence, the Bible tells us that he belonged to the evil one ([1 John 3:12](https://ref.ly/1John3:12)). The Lord confronted Cain with his guilt, judged him, and pronounced a curse upon him. God made Cain leave the land of Nod, east of Eden ([Genesis 4:9–16](https://ref.ly/Gen4:9-Gen4:16)). Cain complained to God that his punishment was greater than he could bear. He was afraid that someone would find him and kill him. So, the Lord put a mark on Cain to protect him. The Lord also promised that if anyone killed Cain, that person would receive punishment seven times worse.

In the land of Nod, Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch ([Genesis 4:17](https://ref.ly/Gen4:17)). Through Enoch, Cain had many descendants. In the early generations, these descendants developed different skills. Some lived in tents and took care of animals. Others became musicians, and some learned how to make things from metal (verses [18–22](https://ref.ly/Gen4:18-Gen4:22)).
