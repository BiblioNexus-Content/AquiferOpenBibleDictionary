## Bribe, Bribery (id: 4335)

BRIBE, BRIBERY
==============

To give a person in authority something valuable to influence them. Bribery was not allowed in the Old Testament law ([Exodus 23:8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:8); [Deuteronomy 16:19](https://ref.ly/Deut16:19)). It was also condemned by the prophets ([Isaiah 1:23](https://ref.ly/Isa1:23); [Amos 5:12](https://ref.ly/Amos5:12); [Micah 3:11](https://ref.ly/Mic3:11)). Although Samuel denied that he ever took a bribe, his sons did not maintain the same standard ([1 Samuel 8:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam8:3); [12:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:3)).

The difference between bribery and giving gifts was not always clear. So, giving something valuable is seen as a way to prevent unwanted conflict ([Proverbs 21:14](https://ref.ly/Prov21:14)). Giving a gift is described (as neither good or bad) as a way to get ahead ([Proverbs 18:16](https://ref.ly/Prov18:16)).

For the most part, the Bible says bribery is evil. “A wicked man takes a covert bribe to subvert the course of justice” ([Proverbs 17:23](https://ref.ly/Prov17:23)). Any system that allows bribery gives rich people an unfair advantage when trying to persuade leaders and judges. Poor people find it difficult to get fair treatment. Innocent people who are poor can be found guilty, while guilty people who are rich can offer a large bribe and go free ([Psalm 15:5b](https://ref.ly/Ps15:5); [Isaiah 5:23](https://ref.ly/Isa5:23)). In the worst cases, bribes were used to hire people to kill others ([Deuteronomy 27:25](https://ref.ly/Deut27:25); [Ezekiel 22:12](https://ref.ly/Ezek22:12)).
