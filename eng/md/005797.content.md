## Wealth (id: 9043)

WEALTH
======

An abundance of money or material goods. Wealth is usually counted using a common system, like money. Wealth is nearly the same as riches and can also refer to having many family members, friends, or good moral qualities.

Wealth in the Old Testament
---------------------------

In the Old Testament, riches represent favor with God ([Psalms 112:3](https://ref.ly/Ps112:3)). God gives power to gain wealth ([Deuteronomy 8:18](https://ref.ly/Deut8:18)). Both the piety and the wealth of Job are well known ([Job 1:1–3](https://ref.ly/Job1:1-Job1:3)). Solomon was perhaps the richest man who ever lived. God granted him "riches, possessions, and honor" because Solomon had asked first for wisdom and discernment ([1 Kings 3:10–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:10-1Kgs3:13); [2 Chronicles 1:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:11-2Chr1:12)). But the Bible makes it clear that a person’s life is not measured by the abundance of possessions ([Luke 12:15](https://ref.ly/Luke12:15)).

Wealth in the New Testament
---------------------------

In the New Testament, wealthy men are often seen as godless. For example, the rich farmer and the rich man who neglected the beggar Lazarus ([Luke 12:16–21](https://ref.ly/Luke12:16-Luke12:21); [16:19–31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31)). The wealthy are condemned for oppression and greed ([James 5:1–6](https://ref.ly/Jas5:1-Jas5:6)). [Luke 6:24](https://ref.ly/Luke6:24) pronounces woe against the rich, and three Gospels speak of the dangers of riches ([Matthew 13:22](https://ref.ly/Matt13:22); [Mark 4:19](https://ref.ly/Mark4:19); [Luke 8:14](https://ref.ly/Luke8:14)). Some rich men were identified as good. Jesus was buried in the tomb of a rich man from Arimathea, Joseph ([Matthew 27:57](https://ref.ly/Matt27:57)). Nicodemus provided very generously for the burial of Jesus ([John 19:39](https://ref.ly/John19:39)). He was "a ruler of the Jews" and probably a man of wealth ([3:1](https://ref.ly/John3:1)).
