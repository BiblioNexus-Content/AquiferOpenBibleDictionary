## Kadmonites (id: 6512)

KADMONITES
==========

A Semitic tribe whose land God promised to the descendants of Abraham ([Genesis 15:19](https://ref.ly/Gen15:19)). Semitic people are ancient groups from the Middle East and North Africa, known for their shared languages (such as Hebrew, Aramaic, or Arabic) and cultural traditions. The name "Kadmonites" means "eastern" in Hebrew. This may be why the Bible sometimes talks about the "people of the east" (for example, in [Genesis 25:6](https://ref.ly/Gen25:6); [Judges 8:10](https://ref.ly/Judg8:10); [1 Kings 4:30](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:30); [Job 1:3](https://ref.ly/Job1:3)).
