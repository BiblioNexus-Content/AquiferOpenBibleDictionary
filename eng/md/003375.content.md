## Kneeling (id: 6633)

KNEELING
========

A body position that means to worship, respect, or submit to someone. 

Strong knees represented a person's strong faith, so kneeling showed respect for someone with greater authority. People knelt before kings, rulers, governors, or God. In [Genesis 41:43](https://ref.ly/Gen41:43), people knelt before Pharaoh and Joseph. People showed their respect for God by kneeling ([Isaiah 45:23](https://ref.ly/Isa45:23); [Romans 14:11](https://ref.ly/Rom14:11); [Philippians 2:10](https://ref.ly/Phil2:10)). During a famine when there was not enough food, some Israelites turned away from God. Those who stayed faithful were called “all whose knees have not bowed to Baal” ([1 Kings 19:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:18); see [Romans 11:4](https://ref.ly/Rom11:4)).

Firm knees meant strength, so hurting those knees meant destroying power ([Deuteronomy 28:35](https://ref.ly/Deut28:35)). Isaiah asked God to make weak knees strong ([Isaiah 35:3](https://ref.ly/Isa35:3)). Weak knees usually showed a lack of strong faith ([Job 4:4](https://ref.ly/Job4:4); [Hebrews 12:12](https://ref.ly/Heb12:12)). Sometimes it meant poor health ([Psalm 109:24](https://ref.ly/Ps109:24)). Ezekiel talked about people whose knees “will turn to water” ([Ezekiel 7:17](https://ref.ly/Ezek7:17); [21:7](https://ref.ly/Ezek21:7)).

Kneeling before God was a way to show worship ([Psalms 95:6](https://ref.ly/Ps95:6)) and also prayer ([Daniel 6:10](https://ref.ly/Dan6:10)). Jesus himself knelt to pray in the garden of Gethsemane ([Luke 22:41](https://ref.ly/Luke22:41)). Peter, Paul, and Stephen all did the same ([Acts 7:60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:60); [9:40](https://ref.ly/Acts9:40); [20:36](https://ref.ly/Acts20:36); [21:5](https://ref.ly/Acts21:5)). Solomon knelt in prayer to God ([1 Kings 8:54](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:54)). Once he even had a platform built so everyone could see him kneeling before God ([2 Chronicles 6:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:13)).

Some knelt to show they were sorry like Ezra did at the evening sacrifice ([Ezra 9:5](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:5)). Peter knelt to beg the Lord’s forgiveness for his lack of faith and trust ([Luke 5:8](https://ref.ly/Luke5:8)). People asking the prophet Elijah for help knelt before him as God’s representative ([2 Kings 1:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:13)). Many came kneeling and begging Jesus for healing ([Matthew 17:14](https://ref.ly/Matt17:14); [Mark 1:40](https://ref.ly/Mark1:40)). Daniel knelt in wonder before an angel ([Daniel 10:10](https://ref.ly/Dan10:10)). When Belshazzar was afraid, his “knees knocked together” ([Daniel 5:6](https://ref.ly/Dan5:6)). 

In the New Testament, Jesus was mocked by soldiers. They joked and pretended he was king. They kneeled before him and cried, “Hail, King of the Jews” ([Matthew 27:29](https://ref.ly/Matt27:29); [Mark 15:19](https://ref.ly/Mark15:19)).
