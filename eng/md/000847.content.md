## Beno (id: 4117)

BENO
====

Jaaziah’s son who is listed as one of the Levites assigned to temple duty ([1 Chronicles 24:26](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:26-1Chr24:27)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:26-1Chr24:27)[27](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:26-1Chr24:27)). It is possible that the Hebrew word is not a proper name, so, it has sometimes been translated “his son.”
