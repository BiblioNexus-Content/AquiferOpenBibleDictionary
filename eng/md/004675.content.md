## Ramoth-Gilead (id: 7932)

RAMOTH\-GILEAD
==============

City lying in the Transjordan area of Gilead and probably identifiable with Tell Ramith, although the site of Tell el\-Husn has also been suggested. Initially, biblical references pertain to Ramoth in Gilead ([Dt 4:43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:43); [Jos 20:8](https://ref.ly/Josh20:8); [21:38](https://ref.ly/Josh21:38)), while later it is called Ramoth\-gilead. Combined names were used to avoid confusion with cities of the same name in other locations.

Ramoth\-gilead, a possession of the tribe of Gad, first appears in the biblical narrative as one of three Transjordan cities of refuge ([Dt 4:43](https://ref.ly/Deut4:43)) later included in the six cities of refuge for all Israel ([Jos 20:8](https://ref.ly/Josh20:8)). It was allotted to the Merarites as one of 48 Levitical cities ([21:38](https://ref.ly/Josh21:38)) and was most likely located along the King’s Highway, which transversed that area.

During the time of Solomon, Ramoth\-gilead enjoyed a place of prominence as the central city in his sixth administrative district and the residence of Ben\-geber, chief officer of that district ([1 Kgs 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:13)). After the division of the kingdom, this border town was taken by the Arameans and became a site of contention between Israel and Aram. King Ahab’s final battle began with his desire to retake Ramoth\-gilead. In seeking to convince his ally Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to support him in this maneuver, he produced many prophets who spoke favorable and victorious words to the king ([1 Kgs 22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:53); [2 Chr 18](https://ref.ly/2Chr18:1-2Chr18:34)). Unconvinced, Jehoshaphat inquired of the word of the Lord through Micaiah, a prophet of the Lord, who warned of impending disaster. The message was ignored and Ahab was killed at Ramoth\-gilead. Ahab’s son Joram also fought with Aram here and was wounded in battle ([2 Kgs 8:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:29); [2 Chr 22:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:6); also called Ramah). Shortly thereafter, Elisha sent one of the sons of the prophets to Ramoth\-gilead, where he anointed Jehu to be king over Israel ([2 Kgs 9:1–14](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:1-2Kgs9:14)).
