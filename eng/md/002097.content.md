## Galeed (id: 5352)

GALEED
======

Name meaning literally “a heap of witness.” Jacob gave this name to a pile of stones erected as a witness to the pact of friendship made between himself and his father\-in\-law, Laban, who named the cairn Jegar\-sahadutha ([Gn 31:47–48](https://ref.ly/Gen31:47-Gen31:48)). Its location is unknown. The name Galeed is not to be confused with the name Gilead, designation of the territory east of the Jordan.
