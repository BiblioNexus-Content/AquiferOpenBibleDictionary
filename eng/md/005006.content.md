## Shalman (id: 8270)

SHALMAN
=======

Unknown conqueror whose brutal destruction of Beth\-arbel was descriptive of Israel’s approaching judgment ([Hos 10:14](https://ref.ly/Hos10:14)). Several suggestions as to the identification of Shalman are the following: Salamanu, the king of Moab who paid tribute to Tiglath\-pileser of Assyria; one of the Shalmaneser kings of Assyria; and Shalmah, a north Arabian tribe that invaded the Negev.
