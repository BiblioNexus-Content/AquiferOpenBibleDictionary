## Lois (id: 6773)

LOIS
====

The grandmother of Timothy ([2 Timothy 1:5](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:5)). Her family, including Timothy’s mother, Eunice, lived at Lystra ([Acts 16:1](https://ref.ly/Acts16:1)). Lois was a committed Jew. She appears to have converted to Christianity during Paul’s first missionary trip (chapter [14](https://ref.ly/Acts14:1-Acts14:28)). Paul comments that Timothy shared the faith of his grandmother and mother.
