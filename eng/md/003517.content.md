## Loins (id: 6772)

LOINS
=====

A region of the body from the chest to the lower hip.

The King James Version uses the expression "out of his loins" refers to someone's descendants ([Genesis 35:11](https://ref.ly/Gen35:11); [46:26](https://ref.ly/Gen46:26); [Exodus 1:5](https://ref.ly/Exod1:5); [1 Kings 8:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:19)). The term "loins" in this context refers to the reproductive area of the male body. In most cases, it means physical features. Sometimes, the term "loins" refers to emotion, power, or strength (see [Nahum 2:1](https://ref.ly/Nah2:1)). 

In ancient times, Hebrew people and others in the Middle East would tie their long robes around their waists before walking long distances ([Exodus 12:11](https://ref.ly/Exod12:11); [1 Kings 18:46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:46); [2 Kings 9:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:1)). This made it easier to walk or run. In the New Testament, when someone is described as having their clothes tied around their waist, it means they were ready for action or battle ([Luke 12:35](https://ref.ly/Luke12:35)). The Bible also uses this image as a symbol. When it talks about "girding the loins," it means to be prepared and in control of yourself ([Ephesians 6:14](https://ref.ly/Eph6:14); [1 Peter 1:13](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13)).
