## Azariah (id: 3902)

AZARIAH
=======

A very common Jewish name. The name appears many times in the family histories of priests, which makes it hard to know which Azariah is being talked about at times. The following is one of several possible arrangements:

1. Zadok’s son or grandson. According to most translations, Azariah was high priest during Solomon’s reign ([1 Kings 4:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:2)). His position might have alternatively been that of a special counselor or keeper of the royal calendar.
2. Nathan’s son, a high official in King Solomon’s court. He was chief officer over the 12 regional administrators ([1 Kings 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:5)).
3. Amaziah’s son, king of Judah ([2 Kings 14:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:21); [15:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)). He was also known as Uzziah. *See* Uzziah \#1.
4. Ethan’s son, a descendant of Judah ([1 Chronicles 2:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:8)).
5. Jehu’s son, another descendant of Judah ([1 Chronicles 2:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:38)).
6. Ahimaaz’s son and Zadok’s grandson ([1 Chronicles 6:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:9)). If Azariah \#1 was a high priest, this Azariah mean the same person.
7. Johanan’s son and Amariah’s father ([1 Chronicles 6:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:10-1Chr6:11)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)[11](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:10-1Chr6:11)). He is the same Azariah who is mentioned in [Ezra 7:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:3) and [2 Esdras 1:2](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:2). His ancestor (called his "father") was Meraioth. The parenthetical note about Solomon’s temple in [1 Chronicles 6:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:10) is generally associated with the Azariah of verse [9](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:9) (see \#6\). It is also possible that this Azariah served in the temple (built by Solomon) during the reign of Uzziah. This would mean he is the same Azariah as \#17 below.
8. Hilkiah’s son and Seriah’s father ([1 Chronicles 6:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:13-1Chr6:14)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)[14](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:13-1Chr6:14); [Ezra 7:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra7:1); [2 Esdras 1:1](https://ref.ly/2Esd1:1)). This Azariah may be the same as \#10 or \#11\.
9. Zephaniah’s son, an ancestor of the singer Heman. Heman sang in the worship ritual instituted by King David ([1 Chronicles 6:36](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:36)).
10. Hilkiah’s son or descendant, one of the first priests to settle in Jerusalem after the exile ([1 Chronicles 9:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:11); "Seraiah," [Nehemiah 11:11](https://ref.ly/Neh11:11)).
11. Oded’s son, a prophet in the days of King Asa of Judah. He encouraged Asa to start badly needed reforms in the king’s 15th year ([2 Chronicles 15:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr15:1-2Chr15:15)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)[15](https://ref.ly/2Chr15:1-2Chr15:15)).
12. A son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. Along with four of their brothers, they were killed for political reasons by Jehoram, the heir to the throne ([2 Chronicles 21:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:4)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)[4](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:4)).
13. Another son of King Jehoshaphat, with the same name as \#12, his brother. Along with four of their brothers, they were killed for political reasons by Jehoram, the heir to the throne ([2 Chronicles 21:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:4)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:1-2Kgs15:7)[4](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:1-2Chr21:4)).
14. An alternate name of Ahaziah, king of Judah ([2 Chronicles 22:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr22:6), King James Version). *See* Ahaziah \#2.
15. Jehoram’s son, one of Judah’s military commanders. This Azariah followed Jehoiada the priest in a rebellion. Joash was crowned king following the rebellion, and Queen Athaliah was executed ([2 Chronicles 23:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:1)).
16. Obed’s son, another of the five commanders in league with Jehoiada against Athaliah ([2 Chronicles 23:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr23:1)).
17. The high priest in Jerusalem during the reign of King Uzziah ([2 Chronicles 26:16–21](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21)). He opposed Uzziah’s arrogant attempt to burn incense on the altar. Perhaps the same as \#7\.
18. Johanan’s son, a leader of Ephraim’s tribe. Azariah and other leaders of the tribe joined the prophet Obed to protest King Pekah of Israel's capture of Judean prisoners and demand their release ([2 Chronicles 28:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:12)).
19. A descendant of Kohath and the father of a Levite named Joel. Joel participated in the temple cleansing commanded by King Hezekiah of Judah ([2 Chronicles 29:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12)).
20. Jehallelel’s son. This Azariah, a descendant of Merari, also participated in Hezekiah’s cleansing of the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:12)).
21. Zadok’s descendant and high priest during the reign of Hezekiah of Judah ([2 Chronicles 31:10, 13](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:10,2Chr31:13)). He participated in Hezekiah’s massive religious reforms.
22. Maaseiah’s son, a householder in Jerusalem who participated in Nehemiah’s rebuilding of the wall ([Nehemiah 3:23](https://ref.ly/Neh3:23)).
23. A leader who returned to Judah with Zerubbabel after the Babylonian exile ([Nehemiah 7:7](https://ref.ly/Neh7:7); "Seraiah," [Ezra 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2)).
24. A Levitical assistant to Ezra who explained to the people passages from the law read by Ezra ([Nehemiah 8:7](https://ref.ly/Neh8:7)).
25. A priest who signed Ezra’s covenant of faithfulness to God with Nehemiah and others after the exile ([Nehemiah 10:2](https://ref.ly/Neh10:2)).
26. A participant in the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 12:33](https://ref.ly/Neh12:33)).
27. An alternate form of Jaazaniah, the name of Hoshaiah’s son, in [Jeremiah 42:1](https://ref.ly/Jer42:1) and [43:2](https://ref.ly/Jer43:2). *See* Jaazaniah \#1.
