## Izrahite (id: 6127)

IZRAHITE
========

Designation given to Shamhuth, one of David’s 12 monthly captains, meaning a man of a family or town called Izra ([1 Chr 27:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:8)). The word “Izrahite” is perhaps a corruption of “Zerahite,” a descendant of Zerah of Judah ([1 Chr 27:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:11)).
