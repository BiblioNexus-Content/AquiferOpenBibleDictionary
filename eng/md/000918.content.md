## Beth-Marcaboth (id: 4189)

BETH\-MARCABOTH
===============

A city in Judah’s territory given to the tribe of Simeon ([Joshua 19:5](https://ref.ly/Josh19:5); [1 Chronicles 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:31)). 

It may be the same as Madmannah ([Joshua 15:31](https://ref.ly/Josh15:31)). The name Beth\-marcaboth means “house of chariots,” and so some have seen a link to the chariot cities of Solomon ([1 Kings 9:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:19); [10:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:26)). We do not know its location unless it is the same as Madmannah.
