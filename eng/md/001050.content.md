## Booth (id: 4306)

BOOTH
=====

A booth is a small, temporary hut or shelter made of branches and sticks. Booths were made when permanent buildings were unavailable. They provided shade during the day and protection from the dew and winds during the night ([Genesis 33:17](https://ref.ly/Gen33:17); [Jonah 4:5](https://ref.ly/Jonah4:5)). 

The word is also used as a figure of speech for something fragile and easily destroyed. For example, the word is translated "hut" in [Job 27:18](https://ref.ly/Job27:18) and "shelter" in [Isaiah 1:8](https://ref.ly/Isa1:8).
