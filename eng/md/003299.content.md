## Kerioth (id: 6558)

KERIOTH
=======

1. A town in the Negev of Judah called Kerioth\-hezron ([Joshua 15:25](https://ref.ly/Josh15:25)). In the Hebrew text, Kerioth and Hezron are understood to be separate towns. Hezron is likely the same place as Hazor mentioned earlier in the list (verse [23](https://ref.ly/Josh15:23)).
2. A town in Moab ([Jeremiah 48:24, 41](https://ref.ly/Jer48:24,Jer48:41); [Amos 2:2](https://ref.ly/Amos2:2)). From information on the Moabite Stone (an ancient stone with writing), we can locate this town in the southwest plateau of Moab, across from Ataroth. Kerioth is not in the list of towns belonging to the tribes of Reuben and Gad ([Numbers 34](https://ref.ly/Num34:1-Num34:29): [Joshua 13](https://ref.ly/Josh13:1-Josh13:33)). In other lists, Kerioth is not mentioned, but a place called Ar is ([Isaiah 15–16](https://ref.ly/Isa15:1-Isa16:14)). This has led scholars to believe that Ar and Kerioth might be the same place.
