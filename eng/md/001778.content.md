## Elizabeth (id: 5029)

ELIZABETH
=========

The mother of John the Baptist and a relative of Mary, the mother of Jesus ([Luke 1:36](https://ref.ly/Luke1:36)). She came from a family of priests ([Luke 1:5](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5)). The name Elizabeth comes from the same Hebrew word as Elisheba, the wife of Aaron ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23)). It means "my God is an oath." Only the Gospel of Luke, which often emphasizes the role of women, tells us about Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah.

Luke emphasizes that Elizabeth and Zechariah were righteous and lived in a way that pleased God ([Luke 1:6](https://ref.ly/Luke1:6)). However, the couple was elderly and had no children, which was often seen as a disgrace in Jewish culture ([Genesis 30:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:23); [Luke 1:25](https://ref.ly/Luke1:25)). Despite this, they remained faithful in their worship and service to God. One day, an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, announcing that Elizabeth would have a son. This son would be the one to prepare the way for the promised Messiah ([Luke 1:13–17](https://ref.ly/Luke1:13-Luke1:17)). When Elizabeth became pregnant, she stayed in seclusion for five months. During this time, her relative Mary came to visit her.
