## Azmaveth (Place) (id: 3915)

AZMAVETH (Place)
================

A town near Anathoth. 

Forty\-two men from the town returned from the exile to Babylon with Zerubbabel ([Ezra 2:24](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:24)). It is called “Beth\-azmaveth” in [Nehemiah 7:28](https://ref.ly/Neh7:28). Later, Azmaveth gave singers to help celebrate the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem ([Nehemiah 12:29](https://ref.ly/Neh12:29)). It is modern\-day Hizmeh, a site eight kilometers (five miles) north of Jerusalem.
