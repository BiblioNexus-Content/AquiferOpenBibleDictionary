## Granary (id: 5525)

GRANARY
=======

A granary is a building where grain is stored after harvest. Farmers use granaries to protect their harvested crops from weather, pests, and animals. In Bible times, granaries were very important for food security. They allowed people to store excess grain from good harvests to use during times of drought or famine.
