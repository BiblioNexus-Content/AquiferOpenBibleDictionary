## Ono (id: 7500)

ONO
===

Benjaminite town built by Shemed ([1 Chr 8:12](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:12)). Some of its inhabitants returned to Palestine with Zerubbabel following the exile ([Ezr 2:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:33); [Neh 7:37](https://ref.ly/Neh7:37)). Its location was variously known as the plain of Ono ([Neh 6:2](https://ref.ly/Neh6:2)) or as the valley of craftsmen ([11:35](https://ref.ly/Neh11:35)). Ono is identified with Kefr ‘Ana, seven miles (11\.3 kilometers) southeast of Joppa.
