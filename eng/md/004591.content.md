## Pulse (id: 7854)

PULSE
=====

A Hebrew word perhaps better translated as "vegetable" ([Daniel 1:12, 16](https://ref.ly/Dan1:12,Dan1:16)). The King James Version translates it as pulse. Not wishing to eat the king’s unclean food, Daniel and his friends requested permission to live on a diet of vegetables and water. The Hebrew word translated as "vegetable" literally means "things sown" and probably includes any kind of seed that can be eaten.
