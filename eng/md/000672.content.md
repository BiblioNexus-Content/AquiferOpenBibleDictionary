## Baal-Meon (id: 3940)

BAAL\-MEON
==========

A city in northern Moab given to the tribe of Reuben ([Numbers 32:38](https://ref.ly/Num32:38); [1 Chronicles 5:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:8)). 

It is called Beth\-baal\-meon in [Joshua 13:17](https://ref.ly/Josh13:17), Beth\-meon in [Jeremiah 48:23](https://ref.ly/Jer48:23), and Beon in [Numbers 32:3](https://ref.ly/Num32:3). In around 830 BC it was owned by Mesha, the king of Moab. By the sixth century BC, it was still owned by the Moabites ([Jeremiah 48:23](https://ref.ly/Jer48:23); [Ezekiel 25:9](https://ref.ly/Ezek25:9)). It may have briefly been in Israelite possession during the eighth century BC.
