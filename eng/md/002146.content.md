## Gederothaim (id: 5399)

GEDEROTHAIM
===========

Village in the Judean Shephelah ([Jos 15:36](https://ref.ly/Josh15:36)) of unknown location. The Hebrew list contains 14 cities without Gederothaim (vv [33–36](https://ref.ly/Josh15:33-Josh15:36)), while the Greek version reads, “Gederah and her sheepfolds” (v[36](https://ref.ly/Josh15:36)). Gederothaim probably reflects a later scribal error where the copyist accidentally made the term “sheepfold” into a 15th city.
