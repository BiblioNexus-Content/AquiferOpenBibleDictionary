## Levi (Person) (id: 6729)

LEVI (Person)
=============

1. Jacob’s third son by Leah ([Genesis 29:34](https://ref.ly/Gen29:34)). We do not know exactly what his name means. Levi was involved in a violent event in Shechem. When Shechem the Hivite attacked Levi's sister Dinah, Levi and his brother, Simeon, killed all the men in the city to get revenge. Jacob did not approve of what they did. Before he died, Jacob said that Levi's children and their children would be spread out among all the tribes of Israel as punishment ([Genesis 49:5–7](https://ref.ly/Gen49:5-Gen49:7)).

    Levi had three sons: Gershon (also called Gershom), Kohath, and Merari. Their families became the tribe of Levi. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were from Kohath's family line ([Exodus 6:16](https://ref.ly/Exod6:16)). When the people made a golden calf to worship at Mount Horeb, the Levites stayed loyal to God. Because of this, God gave them a special role: they would serve in and around the sacred tent (called the tabernacle) and later in the temple ([Exodus 32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35)).
