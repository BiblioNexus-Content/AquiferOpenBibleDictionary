## Harrow (id: 5682)

HARROW\*
========

Agricultural term for implement or procedure, though no implement corresponding to the modern harrow is known from Palestine or Egypt. [Job 39:10](https://ref.ly/Job39:10) speaks of an ox performing the harrowing, while [Isaiah 28:24](https://ref.ly/Isa28:24) notes that plowed ground was leveled as part of the process. Like the foregoing references, [Hosea 10:11](https://ref.ly/Hos10:11) speaks of harrowing in connection with plowing. Most probably harrowing consisted of branches being pulled behind an animal or plow to smooth the land and before seeding. *See* Agriculture.
