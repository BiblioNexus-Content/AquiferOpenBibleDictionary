## Rodanim (id: 8055)

RODANIM
=======

Fourth son of Javan and a descendant of Noah through Japheth’s line ([1 Chr 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:7)). An alternate spelling in [Genesis 10:4](https://ref.ly/Gen10:4) reads Dodanim, possibly a copyist’s error. Both words probably refer to the Greek peoples of Rhodes and its neighboring islands in the Aegean Sea.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 10:4; 1CH 1:7
