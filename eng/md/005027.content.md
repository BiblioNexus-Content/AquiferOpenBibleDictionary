## Shaphir (id: 8290)

SHAPHIR
=======

One of the towns spoken against by Micah the prophet ([Mi 1:11](https://ref.ly/Mic1:11)). Its exact location is not certain. Eusebius (a fourth\-century church historian) suggested that it was a village positioned between the cities of Eleutheropolis and Ashkelon, placing Shaphir in Philistine territory. If this is correct, perhaps Shaphir is identifiable with one of three villages known as es\-Suwafir near the city of Ashdod. Another possible site is Khirbet el\-Kom, situated west of Hebron in the hill country of Judah.
