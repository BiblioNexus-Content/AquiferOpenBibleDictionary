## Telaim (id: 8768)

TELAIM
======

Place where Saul organized Israel’s army in preparation for war with the Amalekites ([1 Sm 15:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:4)). Telaim is perhaps identifiable with Telem, a city situated near Edom’s border in the southern extremity of the territory allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 15:24](https://ref.ly/Josh15:24)).
