## Tumbleweed (id: 8941)

TUMBLEWEED
==========

A tumbleweed is a dry, round plant that rolls across the ground when blown by the wind. The "tumbleweed" mentioned in [Psalm 83:13](https://ref.ly/Ps83:13) and [Isaiah 17:13](https://ref.ly/Isa17:13) likely refer to the Palestinian tumbleweed (*Gundelia tournefortii*). This plant belongs to the thistle family. It is a prickly herb that contains a milky juice. When it dries, it breaks off and rolls across the land, often gathering in large piles in low areas.
