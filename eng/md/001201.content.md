## Censer (id: 4456)

CENSER
======

A censer is a container used to burn incense. On the Day of Atonement, the high priest burned two handfuls of incense in the censer. He did this inside the most holy place before the Lord ([Leviticus 16:12](https://ref.ly/Lev16:12)). The censers of the tabernacle were bronze ([Numbers 16:39](https://ref.ly/Num16:39)). The censers used by the angels in the book of Revelation were gold ([Revelation 8:3–5](https://ref.ly/Rev8:3-Rev8:5)).
