## Ithamar (id: 6106)

ITHAMAR
=======

Aaron’s fourth and youngest son. Ithamar served as a priest to the tribes of Israel when the people lived in the desert wilderness between Egypt and the promised land of Canaan ([Exodus 6:23](https://ref.ly/Exod6:23); [Numbers 3:2–4](https://ref.ly/Num3:2-Num3:4); [26:60](https://ref.ly/Num26:60); [1 Chronicles 6:3](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:3); [24:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:2)). After the death of two of his brothers, he was given the special duty of being in charge of moving of the tabernacle ([Numbers 4:28, 33](https://ref.ly/Num4:28,Num4:33); [7:8](https://ref.ly/Num7:8)). During David’s reign, the descendants of Ithamar and Eleazar were organized as priests in the temple ([1 Chronicles 24:3–6](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:3-1Chr24:6)). Later, some of his descendants returned with Ezra from Babylon ([Ezra 8:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:2)).
