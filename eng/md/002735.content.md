IDDO
====

1\. Father of Ahinadab, Solomon’s official at Mahanaim, who provisioned the royal household ([1 Kgs 4:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:14)).

2\. Gershonite Levite, descendant of Joah and forefather of Zerah ([1 Chr 6:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:21)); perhaps alternately called Adaiah in verse [41](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:41). *See* Adaiah \#2.

3\. Zechariah’s son and the chief officer of Manasseh’s half\-tribe in Gilead during David’s reign ([1 Chr 27:21](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:21)).

4\. Prophet and seer who recorded the events of Solomon’s reign concerning Jeroboam, Nebat’s son in a book of visions ([2 Chr 9:29](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:29)), Rehoboam’s acts in his genealogical records ([12:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:15)), and Abijah’s life as part of a commentary ([13:22](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:22)).

5\. Grandfather of Zechariah the prophet ([Zec 1:1, 7](https://ref.ly/Zech1:1,Zech1:7)).

According to [Ezra 5:1](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:1) and [6:14](https://ref.ly/Ezra6:14), Zechariah, and not Berechiah his father, was considered Iddo’s successor. *See* Zechariah (Person) \#20.
