## Shaalabbin, Shaalbim, Shaalbon (id: 8251)

SHAALABBIN, SHAALBIM, SHAALBON
==============================

An Amorite city known by three names. Joshua assigned this city to the tribe of Dan as part of their inheritance in the promised land. Shaalabbin stood between Ir\-shemesh and Aijalon ([Joshua 19:42](https://ref.ly/Josh19:42)). 

The Danites were not able to defeat the Amorites who lived there, so they could not take control of the city. when the tribe of Joseph became stronger, the Ephraimites (who were part of Joseph's tribe) conquered Shaalbim. They then forced the Amorites who lived there to work for them ([Judges 1:35](https://ref.ly/Judg1:35)). 

In later times, during King Solomon's rule, Shaalbim became part of Solomon's second administrative district. This district also included the cities of Makaz, Beth\-shemesh, and Elon\-beth\-hanan ([1 Kings 4:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:9)). 

One of King David's famous warriors, known as one of "the thirty mighty men," came from this area. His name was Eliahba the Shaalbonite ([2 Samuel 23:32](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:32); [1 Chronicles 11:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:33)).
