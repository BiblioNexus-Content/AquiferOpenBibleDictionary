## Lamb (id: 6671)

LAMB
====

A lamb is a young sheep. In the Bible, lambs are part of the broader group called sheep, which includes both young and adult animals.

Lambs were often used for sacrifices in Israel’s worship ([Exodus 12:3–6](https://ref.ly/Exod12:3-Exod12:6); [Leviticus 4:32](https://ref.ly/Lev4:32)).

In the New Testament, “Lamb of God” is a title for Jesus Christ ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29)). It means Jesus gave his life as the final sacrifice to take away the sins of the world ([1 Peter 1:19](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:19); [Revelation 5:6](https://ref.ly/Rev5:6)). This connects to the lambs killed at Passover. God told the Israelites to mark their doors with the lamb’s blood so they would be spared from death in Egypt ([Exodus 12:21–27](https://ref.ly/Exod12:21-Exod12:27)).
