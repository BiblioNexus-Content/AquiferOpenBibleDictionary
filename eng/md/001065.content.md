## Bozez (id: 4321)

BOZEZ
=====

One of a pair of distinctive rocks (Seneh was the other) flanking the road between Michmash and Gaba. Jonathan and his armor bearer scaled one of these crags to take on a Philistine outpost ([1 Sm 14:4](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:4)). The two rocks are still visible in the modern Wadi Suweinet. *See* Seneh.
