## Abner (id: 3318)

ABNER
=====

Ner’s son and Saul’s cousin. Abner was a commander in Saul’s army ([1 Samuel 14:50](https://ref.ly/1Sam14:50); [17:55](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:55)). He was highly respected by Saul. He even ate at the king’s table together with David and Jonathan ([1 Samuel 20:25](https://ref.ly/1Sam20:25)).

Five years after Saul’s death, Abner made Saul's son Ishbosheth the king of Israel ([2 Samuel 2:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9)–[9](https://ref.ly/2Sam2:8-2Sam2:9)). The war between Ishbosheth and David, the king of Judah, lasted for two years. Abner commanded Ish\-bosheth’s army and Joab commanded David’s army in many small battles. David’s army usually won, but Abner became powerful among Saul’s followers.

Abner slept with Saul's concubine, Rizpah. This was wrong because only the king was allowed to do this. Abner might have been planning to become king himself. When Ishbosheth rebuked him, Abner became so angry that he left Ishbosheth and made an agreement with David. David showed him great respect, and in return, Abner promised to bring all of Israel to support David. 

Joab was afraid of Abner’s influence on the king and killed him. He claimed that he did it to avenge the death of his brother, who Abner had killed in battle. Abner was honored with a public funeral and mourning. This kind of honor was only given to a ruler or great leader. King David wept aloud at the tomb, and even the people wept with him ([2 Samuel 3:7](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:7-2Sam3:34)–[34](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:7-2Sam3:34)). David condemned Joab for murdering Abner.
