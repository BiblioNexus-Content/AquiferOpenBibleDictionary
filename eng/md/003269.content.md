## Kebar (id: 6527)

KEBAR
=====

Canal in Babylonia. The prophet Ezekiel, who was among the exiles from the southern kingdom of Judah, received visions from God while living in the area of the Kebar Canal ([Ez 1:1, 3](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:1,Ezek1:3); [3:15, 23](https://ref.ly/Ezek3:15,Ezek3:23); [10:15, 20, 22](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:15,Ezek10:20,Ezek10:22); [43:3](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:3)). Secular Babylonian texts refer to a *nar Kabaru* that is believed to be the same canal.
