## Build, Building (id: 4355)

BUILD, BUILDING
===============

To build means to make something, often using wood, stone, or other materials. A building is something that people make for shelter or use, like a house, temple, or city wall. The Bible talks often about building or rebuilding altars, temples, homes, and cities. Sometimes the Bible uses the word *build* as a picture of God’s work in his people ([1 Peter 2:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:8)).
