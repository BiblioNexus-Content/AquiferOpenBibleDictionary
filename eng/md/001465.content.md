## Cush (Person) (id: 4719)

CUSH (Person)
=============

1\. Eldest of Ham’s four sons ([Gn 10:6](https://ref.ly/Gen10:6); [1 Chr 1:8](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:8)). Because the other three (Egypt, Put, and Canaan) are place\-names, it is likely that Cush also is a place. It is usually identified with Ethiopia. *See* Cush (Place); Ethiopia.

2\. Benjamite and presumably David’s enemy, mentioned in the title of [Psalm 7](https://ref.ly/Ps7:1-Ps7:17).
