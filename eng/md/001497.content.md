## Dan, Tribe of (id: 4753)

DAN, Tribe of
=============

The Beginning of the Tribe of Dan
---------------------------------

An Israelite tribe, named after Jacob’s fifth son, Dan, and descended from his only known son, Hushim (also referred to as "Shuham" in [Numbers 26:42](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)[43](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)). In its early years, the tribe of Dan did not distinguish itself significantly in the biblical narratives, though a few notable Danites were mentioned during the wilderness period: 

* Oholiab, a skilled craftsman involved in the building of the tabernacle ([Exodus 31:6](https://ref.ly/Exod31:6); [35:34](https://ref.ly/Exod35:34); [38:23](https://ref.ly/Exod38:23))
* A man whose mother married an Egyptian and who blasphemed (spoke disrespectfully about) God ([Leviticus 24:11](https://ref.ly/Lev24:11))
* Ahiezer, chief prince of Dan, during the exodus out of Egypt ([Numbers 1:12](https://ref.ly/Num1:12))

At the first census in the wilderness, the tribe of Dan was the second\-largest tribe, with 62,700 warriors ([Numbers 1:38](https://ref.ly/Num1:38-Num1:39)[–](https://ref.ly/Num1:38-Num1:39)[39](https://ref.ly/Num1:38-Num1:39)). They were instructed to encamp on the north side of the Israelites’ camp with Asher and Naphtali ([Numbers 2:25](https://ref.ly/Num2:25-Num2:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Num2:25-Num2:31)[31](https://ref.ly/Num2:25-Num2:31)). They also were in the rear in the line of march ([Numbers 2:31](https://ref.ly/Num2:31); [10:25](https://ref.ly/Num10:25)). At the second census, just before entering the promised land, the tribe had grown to 64,400 warriors, maintaining its position as the second\-largest tribe ([Numbers 26:42](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)[–](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)[43](https://ref.ly/Num26:42-Num26:43)). 

The Tribe of Dan Moves North
----------------------------

The tribe is not notable during the conquest narratives (stories about taking over the land, [Deuteronomy 2:16–3:29](https://ref.ly/Deut2:16-Deut3:29); [Joshua 1–24](https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh24:33); [Judges 1](https://ref.ly/Judg1:1-Judg1:36)). Dan is listed among the tribes who reminded Israel of the covenant curses (warnings about breaking God's agreement) at Mount Ebal ([Deuteronomy 27:13](https://ref.ly/Deut27:13); compare [Joshua 8:30](https://ref.ly/Josh8:30-Josh8:33)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh8:30-Josh8:33)[33](https://ref.ly/Josh8:30-Josh8:33)). The tribe is called a “lion’s whelp” in Moses’s blessing ([Deuteronomy 33:22](https://ref.ly/Deut33:22)). Some believe that the reference to “Bashan” in that blessing hinted at Dan’s move to the north, where they eventually settled.

One of the most significant references to Dan’s tribe is the account of its move northward ([Joshua 19:40](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)[48](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48); [Judges 18](https://ref.ly/Judg18:1-Judg18:31)). The Danites had been given a territory between Judah and Ephraim that bordered the Mediterranean seacoast ([Joshua 19:40](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:46)[46](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:46); [Judges 5:17](https://ref.ly/Judg5:17)) but were unable to remain in this land except for the valley at Zorah and Eshtaol ([Judges 13:25](https://ref.ly/Judg13:25); [18:2](https://ref.ly/Judg18:2)). As a result, a group of discouraged Danites marched north and captured Laish, located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Sea of Galilee and just below the north of Israel. Laish was renamed Dan at that time ([Judges 18:27](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27-Judg18:29)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27-Judg18:29)[29](https://ref.ly/Judg18:27-Judg18:29)). Their northern territory led to the expression “from Dan to Beersheba” ([Judges 20:1](https://ref.ly/Judg20:1); [2 Samuel 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:10)) as defining Israel’s northern and southern borders.

The Tribe of Dan Turns Away from God
------------------------------------

While the northern settlement of Dan became important, the southern part of the tribe continued for a time, as shown by the actions of Samson, a Danite ([Judges 13–16](https://ref.ly/Judg13:1-Judg16:31)). Over time, however, the southern Danites appear to have merged into the tribe of Judah, as there are no further historical references to the southern Danite tribe in the Old Testament. Nevertheless, the Danites are mentioned during King David’s reign as building a large and loyal army ([1 Chronicles 12:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:35); [27:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr27:22)).

The Danites were among the tribes who did not force the Canaanites to leave their territory ([Joshua 13:4](https://ref.ly/Josh13:4-Josh13:5)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh13:4-Josh13:5)[5](https://ref.ly/Josh13:4-Josh13:5); compare [Judges 1:34](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:35)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:35)[35](https://ref.ly/Judg1:34-Judg1:35)). Joshua had to encourage them to take up the task during the assembly at Shiloh ([Joshua 18:1](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1-Josh18:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1-Josh18:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Josh18:1-Josh18:4); [19:40](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)[–](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)[48](https://ref.ly/Josh19:40-Josh19:48)). Eventually, the Danites abandoned their southern territory and moved north, where conquest was easier. Their disobedience was further displayed in their setting up of a “graven image” and establishing a rival priesthood, even though their priest was a Levite ([Judges 18:30](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30-Judg18:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30-Judg18:31)[31](https://ref.ly/Judg18:30-Judg18:31)). They remained idolatrous, and after Israel divided, King Jeroboam of the northern kingdom of Israel chose the city of Dan as one of the locations for the idol shrines where he set up golden calves ([1 Kings 12:28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)[–](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)[29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:28-1Kgs12:29)). The tribe's crimes, along with those of the other northern tribes, continued ([2 Kings 10:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:29)) until their eventual captivity by the Assyrians ([2 Kings 17:1](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:23)[–](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:23)[23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:23)).

Despite their earlier turning away from God, the name of the tribe of Dan is mentioned in Ezekiel’s vision of the idealized restored land and Jerusalem ([Ezekiel 48:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:1-Ezek48:2,Ezek48:32)[–](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:1-Ezek48:2)[2, 32](https://ref.ly/Ezek48:1-Ezek48:2,Ezek48:32)). In the New Testament, the apostle John did not include the tribe from a list of Israel’s tribes ([Revelation 7:4](https://ref.ly/Rev7:4-Rev7:8)[–](https://ref.ly/Rev7:4-Rev7:8)[8](https://ref.ly/Rev7:4-Rev7:8)).
