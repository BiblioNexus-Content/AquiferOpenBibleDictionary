## Cleanthes (id: 4588)

CLEANTHES
=========

The leader of the Stoic school of philosophy in Athens from 269 to 232 BC. The Stoics were people who followed a type of philosophy (a way of thinking about life) that began in ancient Greece. This philosophy was called "Stoicism." 

Cleanthes wrote a poem called “Hymn to Zeus.” Another Stoic poet named Aratus later adapted parts of this poem when he wrote his own poem called “Phaenomena.” Centuries later the apostle Paul quoted the fifth line of “Phaenomena.” He was speaking to a crowd on the Areopagus in Athens. Paul quoted the words: “We are His offspring” ([Acts 17:28](https://ref.ly/Acts17:28)).
