## Ain (id: 3478)

AIN
===

1. A city on the eastern border of Canaan (the promised land), northeast of the Sea of Galilee ([Numbers 34:11](https://ref.ly/Num34:11)). The name means “well” or “spring.” It may be modern Khirbet ‘Ayyun.
2. A town in the territory of Simeon. Many scholars believe it is the same as En\-rimmon ([Joshua 19:7](https://ref.ly/Josh19:7); compare [Nehemiah 11:29](https://ref.ly/Neh11:29)). This implies a copyist made an error that separated “Ain” from “Rimmon.”

    *See* En\-rimmon.

3. A place name in [Joshua 21:16\.](https://ref.ly/Josh21:16) This is due to a copying mistake because the Hebrew words for “Ain” and “Ashan” look similar. The correct name is Ashan (compare [1 Chronicles 6:59](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:59)).

    *See* Ashan.
