## Throne (id: 8825)

THRONE
======

An elevated, ceremonial chair. It symbolizes the importance and authority of its occupant. As the word "throne" spread, it became a symbol of kingship. It came to mean the kingdom itself. When Pharaoh made Joseph viceroy, he said, "Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you" ([Genesis 41:40](https://ref.ly/Gen41:40)). The establishment of David as king of Israel was equivalent to the establishment of the throne of David ([2 Samuel 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:10)). To occupy the throne indicated succession to the kingship ([1 Kings 1:46](https://ref.ly/1Kgs1:46)).

Only one throne is described in detail in the Old Testament, the throne of Solomon ([1 Kings 10:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:18-1Kgs10:20); [2 Chronicles 9:17–19](https://ref.ly/2Chr9:17-2Chr9:19)). The description and ancient monuments show thrones. They hint at the appearance of the throne of Israel. An elevated seat with six steps leading up to it, the throne was partly made of ivory and overlaid with gold. The throne had a backrest and arms. There were lion statues beside it and six similar statues on either side of the steps. Although not mentioned in the Old Testament’s description, a footstool was an indispensable part of the throne ([Isaiah 66:1](https://ref.ly/Isa66:1)).

The Hebrew term *kisseh* is used as a seat of honor for any distinguished person: 

* A priest ([1 Samuel 4:13, 18](https://ref.ly/1Sam4:13))
* A ruler ([Psalm 94:20](https://ref.ly/Ps94:20))
* A military officer ([Jeremiah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Jer1:15))
* A favored guest ([2 Kings 4:10](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:10))

It mainly refers to a king's chair from which he ruled. The Old Testament refers to thrones of foreign kings ([Exodus 11:5](https://ref.ly/Exod11:5); [Jeremiah 43:10](https://ref.ly/Jer43:10); [Jonah 3:6](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:6)). It especially emphasizes the throne of Israel and the throne of David.

The God of Israel is described metaphorically as sitting upon a throne ([Isaiah 66:1](https://ref.ly/Isa66:1)). Many prophets describe visions of God on a throne:

* Micaiah ([1 Kings 22:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19))
* Isaiah ([Isaiah 6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:3))
* Ezekiel ([Ezekiel 1:4–28](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:4-Ezek1:28); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1))
* Daniel ([Daniel 7:9–10](https://ref.ly/Dan7:9-Dan7:10))

Later, Ezekiel’s vision of the throne of God was of major significance in Jewish “throne mysticism.” In [Revelation 4](https://ref.ly/Rev4:1-Rev4:11), God's throne is flanked by the 24 elder thrones. An emerald rainbow and seven torches surround it. A crystal sea lies in front, with four living creatures on each side.

God's throne is usually in heaven ([Psalm 11:4](https://ref.ly/Ps11:4); [Matthew 5:34](https://ref.ly/Matt5:34)). But, God's throne is also described as being in:

* Jerusalem ([Jeremiah 3:17](https://ref.ly/Jer3:17))
* The temple ([Ezekiel 43:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:6-Ezek43:7))
* Israel ([Jeremiah 14:21](https://ref.ly/Jer14:21))

The concept of Christ’s throne is rare in the Old Testament ([Isaiah 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7); [Jeremiah 17:25](https://ref.ly/Jer17:25)) but common in the New Testament ([Luke 1:32](https://ref.ly/Luke1:32); [Acts 2:30](https://ref.ly/Acts2:30)). This throne symbolizes Christ’s kingship and authority.
