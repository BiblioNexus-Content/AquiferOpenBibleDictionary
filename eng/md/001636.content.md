## Dor (id: 4887)

DOR
===

Fortified Palestinian city (modern el\-Burj) situated along the Mediterranean coast, south of Mt Carmel and eight miles (12\.9 kilometers) north of Caesarea. It is mentioned occasionally in connection with events in the period of the judges and the united monarchy ([Jos 17:11](https://ref.ly/Josh17:11); [Jgs 1:27](https://ref.ly/Judg1:27); [1 Chr 7:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:29)). Dor is probably the same city as Naphath\-dor ([Jos 12:23](https://ref.ly/Josh12:23); [1 Kgs 4:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:11)) and Naphoth\-dor ([Jos 11:2](https://ref.ly/Josh11:2)). During the days of the Conquest, the king of Dor joined Jabin’s confederacy against Joshua ([Jos 11:2](https://ref.ly/Josh11:2)), but was defeated ([12:23](https://ref.ly/Josh12:23)). The city was assigned to Manasseh’s tribe, but the tribe failed to dispossess its inhabitants ([Jgs 1:27](https://ref.ly/Judg1:27)).
