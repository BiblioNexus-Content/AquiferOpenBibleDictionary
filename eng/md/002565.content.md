## Hermogenes (id: 5818)

HERMOGENES
==========

An important Asian Christian who “turned away” from Paul ([2 Timothy 1:15](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:15)). He refused to defend Paul during the apostle’s second imprisonment in Rome. It is uncertain why he abandoned Paul. He might have disagreed about some teaching. But, it seems more likely that Hermogenes was afraid to suffer the same fate as Paul.
