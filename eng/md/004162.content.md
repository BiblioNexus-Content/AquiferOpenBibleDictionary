## Nodab, Nodabites (id: 7418)

NODAB\*, NODABITES
==================

Forefather of an Arabian tribe that joined forces with the Hagarites to fight against the tribes of Israel who were living east of the Jordan ([1 Chr 5:19](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:19)). Though not included in the list of Ishmael’s sons (cf. [Gn 25:13–15](https://ref.ly/Gen25:13-Gen25:15)), he was perhaps a distant relation.
