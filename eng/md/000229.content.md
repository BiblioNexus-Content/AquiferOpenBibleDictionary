## Akrabattene (id: 3489)

AKRABATTENE
===========

The place where Judas Maccabeus destroyed the strongholds of the "sons of Esau," who were causing trouble for the Jews ([1 Maccabees 5:3](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:3); [2 Maccabees 10:14–23](https://ref.ly/2Macc10:14-2Macc10:23)). The phrase "In Idumea, at Akrabattene" likely refers to a northern Edomite area near Acraba ([Judith 7:18](https://ref.ly/Jdt7:18)). It was likely not an area in the Negev Desert as people used to think.
