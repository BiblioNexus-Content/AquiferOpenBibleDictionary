## Hobah (id: 5867)

HOBAH
=====

Town to which Abraham pursued the armies under Chedorlaomer ([Gn 14:15](https://ref.ly/Gen14:15)). Its location is uncertain, but various suggestions have been made. Some equate it with the Hobah about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Damascus; others, with the territory called Ube in the Amarna letters; and still others, with Tell el\-Salihite, 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Damascus.
