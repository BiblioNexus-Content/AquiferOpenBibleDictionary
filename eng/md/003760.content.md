## Meholah, Meholathite (id: 7020)

MEHOLAH, MEHOLATHITE
====================

A place name used to describe Adriel, the son of Barzillai. Adriel was the husband of Merab, who was King Saul's oldest daughter ([1 Samuel 18:19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:19); [2 Samuel 21:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:8)). He probably came from Abel\-meholah, an important city in the region of Gilead. The marriage between Adriel and Merab was likely a political arrangement made by Saul and accepted by David. This arrangement happened even though David was originally supposed to marry Merab himself ([1 Samuel 18:17–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:17-1Sam18:19)).
