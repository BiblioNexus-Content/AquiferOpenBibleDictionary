## Acanthus (id: 715984)

Acanthus *(Acanthus syriacus)*
------------------------------

The acanthus is a perennial herb or small shrub that looks similar to a thistle. It grows about 0\.9 meter (3 feet) tall. This plant is possibly mentioned in [Job 30:7](https://ref.ly/Job30:7) and [Zephaniah 2:9](https://ref.ly/Zeph2:9). The acanthus is a common weed found throughout countries in the East. For thousands of years, artists have used the distinctive shape of acanthus leaves as a model for decorative scrolls and leaf designs in art.
