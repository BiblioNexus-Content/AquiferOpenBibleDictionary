## Naphtuhim, Naphtuhites (id: 7307)

NAPHTUHIM\*, NAPHTUHITES
========================

Egyptian descendants of Noah through Ham’s line ([Gn 10:13](https://ref.ly/Gen10:13); [1 Chr 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:11)), listed between the Lehabim and Pathrusim tribes. Some scholars suggest that the Naphtuhim were the inhabitants of Middle Egypt, situated between the Libyans of Lower Egypt and the Pathrusim of Upper Egypt. However, the exact site of their ancient settlements is uncertain.
