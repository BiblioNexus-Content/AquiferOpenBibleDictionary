## Beth-Millo (id: 4191)

BETH\-MILLO
===========

A house or fortress connected to the city of Shechem. It was mentioned in connection with the crowning of Abimelech (son of Gideon) as king there ([Judges 9:6, 20](https://ref.ly/Judg9:6,Judg9:20)). Since the word “millo” probably means “mount” or “earthwork,” Beth\-millo is often identified with the “tower of Shechem” mentioned later in the same chapter ([Judges 9:46](https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49)[49](https://ref.ly/Judg9:46-Judg9:49)).
