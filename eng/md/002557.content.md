## Herdsmen (id: 5811)

HERDSMEN
========

Men who cared for domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats ([Genesis 13:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gen13:7-Gen13:8); [26:20](https://ref.ly/Gen26:20); [1 Samuel 21:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:7)). They also included shepherds. In the New Testament, shepherds were well known. The metaphor of the shepherd and his sheep was used by Jesus ([John 10:1–16](https://ref.ly/John10:1-John10:16)). Some herdsmen kept pigs ([Matthew 8:33](https://ref.ly/Matt8:33); [Mark 5:14](https://ref.ly/Mark5:14); [Luke 8:34](https://ref.ly/Luke8:34)).
