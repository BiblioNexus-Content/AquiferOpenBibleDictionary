SHABBETHAI
==========

1\. Levite who opposed Ezra’s suggestion that the sons of Israel should divorce the foreign women they had married upon returning to Palestine from exile ([Ezr 10:15](https://ref.ly/Ezra10:15)). He explained the law to the people at Ezra’s reading ([Neh 8:7](https://ref.ly/Neh8:7)).

2\. One of the chiefs of the Levites who oversaw the outside work of the sanctuary during the postexilic period ([Neh 11:16](https://ref.ly/Neh11:16)). He is perhaps identical with \#1 above.
