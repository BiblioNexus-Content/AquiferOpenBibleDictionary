## Arphaxad (id: 3763)

ARPHAXAD
========

Shem’s son and Noah’s grandson. Arphaxad’s descendants were probably the Chaldeans ([Genesis 10:22–24](https://ref.ly/Gen10:22-Gen10:24); [11:10–13](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10-Gen11:13); [1 Chronicles 1:17–18, 24](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17-1Chr1:18,1Chr1:24); [Luke 3:36](https://ref.ly/Luke3:36)). 

Arphaxad was born two years after the flood when his father was one hundred years old ([Genesis 11:10](https://ref.ly/Gen11:10)). He was the grandfather of Eber, whom some believe was ancestor of the Hebrews ([1 Chronicles 1:17–25](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17-1Chr1:25); [Luke 3:35–36](https://ref.ly/Luke3:35-Luke3:36)).
