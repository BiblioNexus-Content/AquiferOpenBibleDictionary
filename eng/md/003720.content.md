## Mattanah (id: 6978)

MATTANAH
========

A place where the Israelites camped after God led them out of Egypt. They came here as they traveled north along the east side of the Dead Sea, moving from the Arnon River toward the land ruled by Sihon, the king of the Amorites ([Numbers 21:18–19](https://ref.ly/Num21:18-Num21:19)). Today, we do not know exactly where Mattanah was, but it is likely at a place now called Khirbet el\-Medeiyineh, near a valley called Wadi eth\-Themed.
