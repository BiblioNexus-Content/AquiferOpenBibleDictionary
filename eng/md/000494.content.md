## Aromatic Cane (id: 3760)

AROMATIC CANE
-------------

A sweet\-smelling plant used by the Israelites as a perfume ([Song of Solomon 4:14](https://ref.ly/Song4:14)). It was also used as one of the ingredients in the holy anointing oil ([Exodus 30:23](https://ref.ly/Exod30:23)). It may have come from a type of reed that grows in wet, tropical areas, possibly imported from distant lands. The exact plant is uncertain, but some scholars think it may refer to calamus or lemongrass.

*See* Calamus, Cane.
