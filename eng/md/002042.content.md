## Fortunatus (id: 5298)

FORTUNATUS
==========

Member of the church at Corinth. Fortunatus is a Roman proper name written in Greek and found only once in the NT ([1 Cor 16:17](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:17)). Paul rejoiced that he, along with Stephanas and Achaicus, had come to be with him in Ephesus. The Textus Receptus has a subscript naming these three men as the carriers of Paul’s letter to the Corinthians.
