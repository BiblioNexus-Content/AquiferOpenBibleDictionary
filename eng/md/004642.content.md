## Rachel’s Tomb (id: 7904)

RACHEL’S TOMB
=============

A landmark set up by Jacob at the site of Rachel’s grave ([Genesis 35:19](https://ref.ly/Gen35:19-Gen35:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Gen35:19-Gen35:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Gen35:19-Gen35:20)). It still existed at the time of Samuel ([1 Samuel 10:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:2)). 

Two persisting traditions make its original location still questionable: 

1. The older tradition locates the tomb near Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem ([Genesis 35:19](https://ref.ly/Gen35:19); [48:7](https://ref.ly/Gen48:7); [Matthew 2:18](https://ref.ly/Matt2:18)). This option has strong support from Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome, Origen, and the Talmudists.
2. A second site is Ephrath ([Genesis 35:19](https://ref.ly/Gen35:19)), which was on the northern border of Benjamin, 16\.1 kilometers (ten miles) north of Jerusalem ([1 Samuel 10:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:2); [Jeremiah 31:15](https://ref.ly/Jer31:15)), near ancient Bethel.

Rachel’s tomb is the first recorded instance in the Bible of a "sepulchral monument" (a large statue in memory of the dead). A picture of the tomb is a common decorative piece in Jewish homes throughout the world.
