## Porch (id: 7780)

PORCH
=====

Court associated with the temple or palace. In the kjv, it is the translation of several Hebrew words. In [1 Kings 7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:1-1Kgs7:51) and [Ezekiel 40](https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek40:49), the kjv has many mentions of porch as a part of the temple. The porch separated the Holy Place from the rest of the world. By means of several steps, one would enter into the porch, which was elevated above the surrounding area. Both the steps and the elevation emphasized the separation of the temple. On both sides of the entrance to the porch stood the supporting pillars, the Jachin and the Boaz. In the NT the kjv has “porch” for proaulion and stoa (“portico”). The stoa was a roofed portico supported by pillars. Solomon’s portico was the famous collonaded porch around the temple area facing the temple (cf. [Jn 10:23](https://ref.ly/John10:23); [Acts 3:11](https://ref.ly/Acts3:11); [5:12](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12)).
