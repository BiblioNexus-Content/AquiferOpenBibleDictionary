## Menelaus (id: 7046)

MENELAUS
========

It is thought that this conscienceless, conniving high priest was the leader of the Jewish supporters of the Seleucid kings during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. [Second Maccabees 4:23–50](https://ref.ly/2Macc4:23-2Macc4:50) relates the story of how Menelaus outbid Jason for the priesthood by paying Antiochus 300 talents of silver above Jason’s price.
