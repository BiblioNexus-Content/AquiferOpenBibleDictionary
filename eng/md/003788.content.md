## Meni (id: 7048)

MENI\*
======

Pagan god of destiny or luck worshiped by apostate Jews ([Is 65:11](https://ref.ly/Isa65:11)). The name is rendered “destiny” in nasb, niv, nlt; “fortune” in neb; and “unto that number” in kjv, reflecting the meaning of the Hebrew word “to count, apportion,” as it were, by fate. Meni has been identified with the Arabic god Maniyyat, Babylonian Manu, and Edomite Manat. The reference in Isaiah has to do with preparing meals for pagan deities.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 65:11
