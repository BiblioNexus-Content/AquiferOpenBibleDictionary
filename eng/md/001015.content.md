## Bochim (id: 4286)

BOCHIM
======

Bochim was a place near Gilgal mentioned in [Judges 2:1–5](https://ref.ly/Judg2:1-Judg2:5). There, the angel of the Lord spoke to the people of Israel. He said they had disobeyed God by not driving out the Canaanites. Because of this, God said the Canaanites would become “thorns” in their sides and their gods would be a “snare” to them.

The people were very sad and wept. That is why the place was called "Bochim," which means “weepers.”

Many Bible scholars think Bochim was another name for Bethel. The Greek version of the Old Testament (called the Septuagint) says “Bethel” in this passage.
