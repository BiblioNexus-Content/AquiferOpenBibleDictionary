## Corner Gate (id: 4655)

CORNER GATE
===========

Gate presumably located in the northwest corner of the Jerusalem wall. After King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah, he tore down a section of the Jerusalem wall from the Corner Gate to the Ephraim Gate ([2 Kgs 14:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:13); [2 Chr 25:23](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:23)); later King Uzziah of Judah built towers at this gate ([2 Chr 26:9](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:9)). Jeremiah ([Jer 31:38](https://ref.ly/Jer31:38)) foretells a time when the Jerusalem wall will be rebuilt from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. Zechariah ([Zec 14:10](https://ref.ly/Zech14:10)) also envisions a period of security and prosperity epitomized by the presence of the Jerusalem wall, including the Corner Gate.
