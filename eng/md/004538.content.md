## Power (id: 7800)

POWER
=====

The ability to do things because of strength, skill, resources, or permission. 

The Bible uses several words for power in Hebrew in the Old Testament and Greek in the New Testament. We can group what the Bible says about power into four main areas:

1. God's unlimited power
2. The limited power God gives to his creation
3. God's power shown through Jesus Christ
4. God's power (through the Holy Spirit) in his people's lives

The Unlimited Power of God
--------------------------

God is all\-powerful. All other power comes from him and is under his control. Much that the Bible says is summed up in the words of [1 Chronicles 29:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:11-1Chr29:12)[–](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:11-1Chr29:12)[12,](https://ref.ly/1Chr29:11-1Chr29:12) addressed to God in praise: “Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in heaven and on earth belongs to You. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as head over all. Both riches and honor come from You, and You are the ruler over all. In Your hands are power and might to exalt and give strength to all.” 

The Bible often describes God's power as his "mighty hand" and "outstretched arm" ([Exodus 6:6](https://ref.ly/Exod6:6); [7:4](https://ref.ly/Exod7:4); [Psalm 44:2](https://ref.ly/Ps44:2-Ps44:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Ps44:2-Ps44:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Ps44:2-Ps44:3)). We see God's power in: 

* creation ([Psalm 65:6](https://ref.ly/Ps65:6); [Isaiah 40:26](https://ref.ly/Isa40:26); [Jeremiah 10:12](https://ref.ly/Jer10:12); [27:5](https://ref.ly/Jer27:5))
* God's rule over the world ([2 Chronicles 20:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:6))
* God's acts of salvation and judgment ([Exodus 15:6](https://ref.ly/Exod15:6); [Deuteronomy 26:8](https://ref.ly/Deut26:8))
* Helping his people ([Psalm 111:6](https://ref.ly/Ps111:6))

The New Testament also speaks of God's mighty power. [Ephesians 1:19](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19) says that his power is unlimited. In [Matthew 26:64,](https://ref.ly/Matt26:64) Jesus used "Power" as another name for God: "You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power."

The Limited Power God Gives to His Creatures
--------------------------------------------

God's creation has power of its own. For example:

* animals, such as the wild ox, the horse, and the lion ([Job 39:11, 19](https://ref.ly/Job39:11,Job39:19); [Proverbs 30:30](https://ref.ly/Prov30:30))
* the wind, storm, thunder, and lightning

Power is given to humans in: 

* physical strength ([Judges 16:5](https://ref.ly/Judg16:5-Judg16:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg16:5-Judg16:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Judg16:5-Judg16:6))
* the power to fight ([Judges 6:12](https://ref.ly/Judg6:12))
* the power to do good and the power to harm ([Genesis 31:29](https://ref.ly/Gen31:29); [Proverbs 3:27](https://ref.ly/Prov3:27); [Micah 2:1](https://ref.ly/Mic2:1))

Rulers have God\-given power and authority ([Romans 13:1](https://ref.ly/Rom13:1)).

The Bible also speaks of the power of angels ([2 Peter 2:11](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:11)) and spiritual beings called “principalities and powers.” Satan has power as well (see [Job 1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:12)[–](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:12)[12](https://ref.ly/Job1:6-Job1:12); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Job2:1-Job2:6)). Sin, evil, and death are allowed to have some power over men ([Hosea 13:14](https://ref.ly/Hos13:14); [Luke 22:53](https://ref.ly/Luke22:53); [Romans 3:9](https://ref.ly/Rom3:9)). 

All of these have limited power, and God gives his people strength to conquer all these powers. He can protect them from wild animals ([Daniel 6:27](https://ref.ly/Dan6:27); [Luke 10:19](https://ref.ly/Luke10:19)) and from other people's control. Jesus told Pilate, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above” ([John 19:11](https://ref.ly/John19:11)).God can save people from sin, death, Satan, and all evil spiritual forces ([2 Corinthians 10:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:4); [Ephesians 6:10](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:18)[18](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:18)). The “ruler of this world” has no power over Christ ([John 14:30](https://ref.ly/John14:30)), so he cannot control those who trust in Him.

The Power of God Seen in Jesus Christ
-------------------------------------

The gospels and the book of Acts often show the power of Christ. His power is shown in his:

* miracles ([Matthew 11:20](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20); [Acts 2:22](https://ref.ly/Acts2:22))
* healings
* exorcisms ([Luke 4:36](https://ref.ly/Luke4:36); [5:17](https://ref.ly/Luke5:17); [6:19](https://ref.ly/Luke6:19); [Acts 10:38](https://ref.ly/Acts10:38))

His resurrection shows His greatest power. Jesus talked about His ability to lay down His life and take it up again ([John 10:18](https://ref.ly/John10:18)), but the New Testament often mentions God the Father’s power in raising His Son from the dead ([Romans 1:4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:4); [Ephesians 1:19](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)). Eventually, He will come with power and great glory ([Matthew 24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30)). During His life on earth, He did His powerful works through the Holy Spirit ([Luke 4:14](https://ref.ly/Luke4:14); [Acts 10:38](https://ref.ly/Acts10:38)).

The Power of God in the Lives of His People
-------------------------------------------

In the Old Testament, God often makes the weak strong. He gives power to those who are weak ([Isaiah 40:29](https://ref.ly/Isa40:29)) so they can grow stronger ([Psalm 84:7](https://ref.ly/Ps84:7); see also [Psalms 68:35](https://ref.ly/Ps68:35); [138:3](https://ref.ly/Ps138:3)). His power is given to prophets ([Micah 3:8](https://ref.ly/Mic3:8)) and kings ([1 Samuel 2:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:10); [Psalm 21:1](https://ref.ly/Ps21:1)). His power will be given in a special way to the Messiah ([Isaiah 9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6); [11:2](https://ref.ly/Isa11:2); [Micah 5:4](https://ref.ly/Mic5:4)). But all of God’s people receive power to live for and serve Him ([Isaiah 49:5](https://ref.ly/Isa49:5)). 

In the New Testament, the gospel is described as the power of God to save everyone who believes ([Romans 1:16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:16)). “But to all who did receive Him \[Jesus Christ], to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God” ([John 1:12](https://ref.ly/John1:12)). 

As children of God, they receive power from the Holy Spirit ([Acts 6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8)):

* power to live in his service ([Ephesians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Eph3:16))
* power to be his witnesses ([Luke 24:49](https://ref.ly/Luke24:49); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8))
* power to endure suffering ([2 Timothy 1:8](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8))
* power for ministry ([Ephesians 3:7](https://ref.ly/Eph3:7))
* power in the face of weakness ([2 Corinthians 12:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:9))
* power through prayer ([James 5:16](https://ref.ly/Jas5:16))
* power to be kept from evil ([1 Peter 1:5](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:5))

Those who do great things for Christ do not do them on their own ([Acts 3:12](https://ref.ly/Acts3:12)). They go out knowing that everything is under His control and that He will always be with them ([Matthew 28:18](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20)).
