## Caleb-Ephrathah (id: 4388)

CALEB\-EPHRATHAH
================

Possibly a Hebrew place\-name ([1 Chr 2:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:24), kjv, nlt). A number of modern translations follow the Septuagint (early Greek translation of the OT) in treating Ephrathah as the name of one of Caleb’s wives instead of a place.

* **Associated Passages:** 1CH 2:24
