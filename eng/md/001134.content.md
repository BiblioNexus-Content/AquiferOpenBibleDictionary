## Caleb (id: 4390)

CALEB
=====

1. A son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ([Numbers 32:12](https://ref.ly/Num32:12); [Joshua 14:6](https://ref.ly/Josh14:6)). He was the older brother of Kenaz ([Judges 1:13](https://ref.ly/Judg1:13)). Caleb was one of the 12 spies sent to explore the land of Canaan. While most of the spies were afraid to attack, Caleb and Joshua recommended moving forward immediately. The Israelites rejected their advice because they feared the strongly defended cities. Because of this lack of faith, God delayed Israel's entrance into Canaan, the promised land, for many years ([Numbers 14:21–23, 34–35](https://ref.ly/Num14:21-Num14:23,Num14:34-Num14:35)).

    When Israel finally entered Canaan under Joshua's leadership, Caleb was 85 years old ([Joshua 14:6–7, 10](https://ref.ly/Josh14:6-Josh14:7,Josh14:10)). Joshua assigned Hebron as the territory of Caleb. Caleb conquered the Anakim who lived there (verses [13–14](https://ref.ly/Josh14:13-Josh14:14)). Caleb offered his daughter Acsah in marriage to anyone who conquered the nearby town of Kiriath\-sepher (also called Debir). His nephew Othniel (who was Acsah's cousin) conquered the city and married Acsah ([15:16–17](https://ref.ly/Josh15:16-Josh15:17)).

    Hebron later became a city of refuge for Levites ([Joshua 21:13](https://ref.ly/Josh21:13); [1 Chronicles 6:55–57](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:55-1Chr6:57)). In part of Caleb's territory, David spent time hiding from King Saul. There David met his future wife Abigail, who was then married to Nabal, a descendant of Caleb ([1 Samuel 25:3](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:3)). This area was also where David's wives were captured by Amalekite raiders who had attacked southern Judah and "the Negev of Caleb" ([1 Samuel 30:14](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:14)).

2. A son of Hezron and brother of Jerahmeel ([1 Chronicles 2:18, 42](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:18,1Chr2:42)). This Caleb is also called Chelubai (verse [9](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:9)). Many scholars think this might be the same person as the Caleb mentioned above. They believe this because:

    1. Both men have a daughter named Achsah (verse [49](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:49)).
        2. It would be unusual for an otherwise unknown Caleb to have such an important place in the family records.
        According to these scholars, Caleb is a son of Hezron and the grandson of Judah. This was to establish his position and inheritance in the tribe of Judah. But Caleb was a foreigner. He was a son of Jephunneh, a Kenizzite. He had joined himself and his clan to the tribe of Judah. Some scholars support this view. They argue that the name Caleb is Horite, not Israelite.

3. The King James Version calls Caleb a son of Hur ([1 Chronicles 2:50](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:50)). But it is likely the King James Version combines what should be two separate phrases. The Berean Standard Bible correctly shows this as two separate statements: “These were the descendants of Caleb. The sons of Hur…”
