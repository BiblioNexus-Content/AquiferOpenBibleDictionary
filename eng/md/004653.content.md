## Raisin (id: 7916)

RAISIN
======

A basic food in biblical lands made by drying grapes on housetops. They used raisins as gifts ([1 Samuel 25:18](https://ref.ly/1Sam25:18); [2 Samuel 16:1–3](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:1-2Sam16:3)). They sometimes offered them to false gods ([Hosea 3:1](https://ref.ly/Hos3:1)). Raisins were considered a source of nourishment ([1 Samuel 30:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam30:12); [1 Chronicles 12:40](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:40)).
