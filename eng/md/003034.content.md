## Jehovah-Tsidkenu (id: 6288)

JEHOVAH\-TSIDKENU
=================

A special name that means “The Lord (Yahweh or Jehovah) is our righteousness.” This name was given to a future righteous king that God promised would come from King David's family ([Jeremiah 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6)). This same name was also used to describe the people who would live under this king's rule ([33:16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:16)). Christians believe this promise came true when Jesus Christ came. They believe Jesus is the Lord who rules over everything and helps his followers live in a right relationship with God.
