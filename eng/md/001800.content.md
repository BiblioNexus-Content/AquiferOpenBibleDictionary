## Eltekeh (id: 5054)

ELTEKEH
=======

City allotted to Dan’s tribe for an inheritance ([Jos 19:44](https://ref.ly/Josh19:44)); it was later assigned to the Kohathite Levites ([21:23](https://ref.ly/Josh21:23)). An important battle was fought near Eltekeh between King Sennacherib of Assyria and the Egyptians. The Egyptians were subsequently routed, and the city was captured by the Assyrians. From here Sennacherib went on to invade Judah ([2 Kgs 18:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:13)). Eltekeh was located north of Ekron and west of Timnah, but its exact site is uncertain.
