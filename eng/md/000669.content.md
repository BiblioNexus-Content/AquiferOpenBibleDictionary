## Baal-Hermon (id: 3936)

BAAL\-HERMON
============

A Hivite territory in Transjordan near Mount Hermon. It was not captured in the Israelite conquest. 

God used this region and others to test the younger generation of Israel ([Judges 3:1](https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:6)[–](https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:6)[6](https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:6)). Baal\-hermon may refer to a place on the mountain. It seems to be another name for Baal\-gad ([Joshua 13:5](https://ref.ly/Josh13:5)).

*See also* Hermon, Mount.
