## Pearl (id: 7622)

PEARL
=====

A gem formed within the shell of certain mollusks. 

The word appears only once in the Old Testament ([Job 28:18](https://ref.ly/Job28:18)). Some think that the "reddish" stone in [Lamentations 4:7](https://ref.ly/Lam4:7) refers to a pink pearl from the Red Sea. By the New Testament period, the pearl was: 

* Prized jewelry ([1 Timothy 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:9))
* An item of trade ([Matthew 13:45](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)[46](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46); [Revelation 18:12](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12-Rev18:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12-Rev18:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Rev18:12-Rev18:16))
* An object of high price

Being familiar objects, Jesus used pearls often in his illustrations. A fine pearl was an object of such great value that a man might sell all his accumulated wealth to buy it ([Matthew 13:45](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)[46](https://ref.ly/Matt13:45-Matt13:46)). A pearl (a metaphor for the Lord's word) would not be given to those, like pigs, who did not value it ([Matthew 7:6](https://ref.ly/Matt7:6)).
