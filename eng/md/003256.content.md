## Kain (Place) (id: 6513)

KAIN (Place)
============

Town in the Judean hill country ([Jos 15:57](https://ref.ly/Josh15:57)). Its place in the same district as the known cities of Maon, Carmel, Ziph, and Juttah (v [55](https://ref.ly/Josh15:55)) favors its identification with Khirbet Yuqim, southwest of Hebron.

* **Associated Passages:** JOS 15:55; JOS 15:57
