## Chalkstone (id: 4469)

CHALKSTONE\*
============

Literally “stones of chalk,” mentioned as illustrative of the destruction of the pagan altars in Judah ([Is 27:9](https://ref.ly/Isa27:9)). Chalk beds cap many of the Judean hills, and since the substance easily erodes, Isaiah’s prophecy is apt.

* **Associated Passages:** ISA 27:9
