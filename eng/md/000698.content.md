## Baharum, Baharumite, Bahurim (id: 3968)

BAHARUM, BAHARUMITE, BAHURIM
============================

A village in the tribal land of Benjamin. It was on the old road connecting Jericho and Jerusalem, east of the Mount of Olives. Bahurim is the modern\-day Ras et\-Temim. Palti lost his wife, Michal, there at Abner’s command when Michal was being returned to King David ([2 Samuel 3:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:16)). At Bahurim, Shimei cursed David and threw stones at him and his servants ([2 Samuel 16:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:5); [19:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:16); [1 Kings 2:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:8)). Jonathan and Ahimaaz, spying for David, were hidden from Absalom’s soldiers in a well there ([2 Samuel 17:18](https://ref.ly/2Sam17:18)). One of David’s mighty men, Azmaveth, came from Bahurim ([2 Samuel 23:31](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:31); [1 Chronicles 11:33](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:33)).
