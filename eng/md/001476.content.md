CYMBAL
======

A cymbal is a musical instrument made of two round, thin, slightly curved metal plates that are hit together to make a ringing sound. Israelites used cymbals in the worship of God ([2 Samuel 6:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5); [Ezra 3:10](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:10); [Psalm 150:5](https://ref.ly/Ps150:5)).
