## Ehud (id: 4957)

EHUD
====

1\. Judge of Israel from Benjamin’s tribe who delivered Israel from Eglon, king of the Moabites ([Jgs 3:12–30](https://ref.ly/Judg3:12-Judg3:30)). He was notable because he was left\-handed (Hebrew “hindered in the right hand”). Before taking Israelite tribute to Eglon, he made an iron dagger, with which he assassinated the unsuspecting Eglon during a private audience. He then rallied the Israelites west of the Jordan to encircle the Moabite troops before they could return south to Moab. When the 18\-year rule of Eglon over the Israelites ended, an 80\-year period of peace began.

2\. Bilhan’s son, a member of Benjamin’s tribe ([1 Chr 7:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:10); [8:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:6)).
