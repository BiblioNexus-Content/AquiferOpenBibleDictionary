## Stephen (id: 8624)

STEPHEN
=======

Stephen was one of the first deacons (church leaders who took care of practical needs) in the early church. He was the first person to die for his faith in Jesus.

Stephen's Role in the Early Church
----------------------------------

For Luke, Stephen shows how some people in the early Jerusalem church were becoming more interested in Greek culture. Also, Stephen's speech criticizes traditional Judaism and suggests spreading the gospel beyond Judea ([Acts 7:1–53](https://ref.ly/Acts7:1-Acts7:53)).

In [Acts 6](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:15), Luke describes the first division in the early church. The community included two groups of Jewish believers: “Hebrews” and “Hellenists.” These terms show a cultural and language difference. The Hebrews came from Aramaic\-speaking synagogues, and the Hellenists came from Greek\-speaking ones. Stephen was one of seven deacons chosen to care for the Hellenists. From the beginning, his importance stands out. He is the only one described as “full of faith and of the Holy Spirit” ([Acts 6:5](https://ref.ly/Acts6:5)). After the deacons were chosen, Stephen is mentioned again as "full of grace and power." He he performed "great wonders and signs among the people" ([Acts 6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8)).

Stephen's Trial Before the Sanhedrin
------------------------------------

Stephen's preaching caused conflict with the Greek\-speaking synagogues in Jerusalem ([Acts 6:9](https://ref.ly/Acts6:9)). His speech before the Sanhedrin shows that Stephen wanted to separate from old Jewish customs and temple practices. Luke’s account of Stephen’s arrest and trial ([6:10–7:60](https://ref.ly/Acts6:10-Acts7:60)) mirrors the trial of Jesus. Once Judea became a province, the Roman governor controlled most punishments. But, the Sanhedrin could still prosecute temple offenses. Stephen was ultimately stoned to death ([Acts 7:54](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts7:60)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts7:60)[60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts7:60)). As the first martyr of the church, Stephen imitated Jesus even in death. He gave his spirit to Jesus (like Jesus did to the Father, [Luke 23:46](https://ref.ly/Luke23:46)) and asked forgiveness for his killers ([Acts 7:59](https://ref.ly/Acts7:59-Acts7:60)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts7:59-Acts7:60)[60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:59-Acts7:60)).

Stephen's Speech and Martyrdom
------------------------------

Stephen's speech in [Acts 7](https://ref.ly/Acts7:1-Acts7:60) is his defense. It also serves Luke's goal of spreading the gospel to other lands ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). It is the longest speech in Acts and comes at a crucial moment in early church history. Stephen reviews biblical history. He argues that the core of Judaism was at risk. He notes that the Jews took pride in the temple. But, it was not God's original idea. Solomon's temple was different from the tabernacle in the wilderness. Stephen also uses the Torah to highlight Israel’s repeated disobedience. The same scriptures predicted the coming of "the righteous one," who Israel crucified.

Stephen’s speech has important meanings. He shows that the national and religious boundaries of Judaism do not limit God. Judaism’s exclusive attitude is unnatural, and God’s work is always moving. If Stephen was right, the Jewish church should be free to take the gospel beyond Judea. Stephen's martyrdom led to persecution in Jerusalem ([Acts 8:1](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)[3](https://ref.ly/Acts8:1-Acts8:3)). This also led to the gospel spreading to the Samaritans and then to the Greeks.
