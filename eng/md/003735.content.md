MAZZAROTH
=========

A word appearing in [Job 38:32](https://ref.ly/Job38:32) that may refer to a constellation. The Hebrew form is feminine in [Job 38:32](https://ref.ly/Job38:32) and masculine in [Job 9:9\.](https://ref.ly/Job9:9) Some scholars think it refers to the Hyades (a group of stars within the bull\-shaped pattern of stars called Taurus). Others think it might mean:

* The Great Bear (a pattern of stars that looks like a bear; also called Ursa Major)
* The 12 signs of the zodiac (patterns of stars that mark the sun's path through the sky)
* The Northern Crown (a group of stars that form a crown shape; also called Corona Borealis)
