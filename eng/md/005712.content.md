## Unicorn (id: 8962)

UNICORN\*
=========

KJV rendering for an animal called a “wild ox” in the nlt and most modern translations ([Nm 24:8](https://ref.ly/Num24:8); [Dt 33:17](https://ref.ly/Deut33:17)). Unicorn is an unfortunate translation (following the Septuagint) because the animal had two horns, not one. *See* Animals (Wild Ox).
