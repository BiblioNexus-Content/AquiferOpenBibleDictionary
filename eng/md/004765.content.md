## Rhoda (id: 8029)

RHODA
=====

A servant girl in the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark, in Jerusalem. Rhoda reported to those in the house that Peter was standing outside the door. Since they were unaware of his release from prison, the others at first did not believe her report ([Acts 12:13–15](https://ref.ly/Acts12:13-Acts12:15)).
