## Shaaraim (id: 8254)

SHAARAIM
========

1\. One of 14 cities in the lowland region of the territory allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance, listed between Azekah and Adithaim ([Jos 15:36](https://ref.ly/Josh15:36)). Shaaraim was in the direction in which the Philistines tried to escape from the pursuing Israelites following David’s slaying of Goliath ([1 Sm 17:52](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:52)).

2\. One of 14 cities where the sons of Shimei, a descendant of Simeon, lived until David’s reign ([1 Chr 4:31](https://ref.ly/1Chr4:31)). It is possibly the same city as Sharuhen ([Jos 19:6](https://ref.ly/Josh19:6)), mentioned in a parallel passage, and Shilhim, located in the southern portion of Judah near Edom’s border ([15:32](https://ref.ly/Josh15:32)).
