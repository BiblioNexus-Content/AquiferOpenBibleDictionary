====

A river near the Persian capital city of Susa where Daniel received a vision about the end times ([Daniel 8:2–16](https://ref.ly/Dan8:2-Dan8:16)). It is likely the same as the Eulaeus, which is described by both Greek and Roman geographers as a stream that flowed to the west of the citadel of Susa.
