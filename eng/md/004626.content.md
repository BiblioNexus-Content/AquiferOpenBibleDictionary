## Raama, Raamah (id: 7889)

RAAMA\*, RAAMAH
===============

One of Cush’s five sons and a descendant of Ham’s line. He was the father of Sheba and Dedan ([Gn 10:7](https://ref.ly/Gen10:7); [1 Chr 1:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:9)). [Ezekiel 27:22](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:22) mentions the people of Sheba and Raamah trading spices and precious stones with the merchants of Tyre. Raamah’s name was later given to a town perhaps identifiable with Ma’in in southwest Arabia.
