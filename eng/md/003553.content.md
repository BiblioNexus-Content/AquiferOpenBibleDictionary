MAACAH, MAACHAH\* (Place)
=========================

Small kingdom in northern Transjordan alternately named Aram\-Maacah in [1 Chronicles 19:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:6) (kjv “Syria\-maachah”). According to [Joshua 13:11](https://ref.ly/Josh13:11), the states of Geshur and Maacah were between Gilead and Mt Hermon and they bordered the kingdom of Og, ruler of Bashan ([Jos 12:4–5](https://ref.ly/Josh12:4-Josh12:5)). Its people were reckoned as descendants of Nahor ([Gn 22:24](https://ref.ly/Gen22:24)) and were the southernmost of the Nahorite tribes.
