## Maacah, Maachah (Person) (id: 6808)

MAACAH, MAACHAH (Person)
========================

Maacah (also spelled Maachah in the King James Version) was a common Hebrew name in the Old Testament. Several people had this name.

1. The last of four children born to Nahor, Abraham’s brother, and Reumah, his concubine ([Genesis 22:24](https://ref.ly/Gen22:24)).
2. A daughter of King Talmai of Geshur. She was a wife of King David, and mother of Absalom ([2 Samuel 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:3); [1 Chronicles 3:2](https://ref.ly/1Chr3:2)).
3. The father of Achish. King Achish of Gath housed two of the slaves of Shimei during the rule of King Solomon ([1 Kings 2:39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:39)). He is probably the same person called Moach in [1 Samuel 27:2](https://ref.ly/1Sam27:2).

    *See* Maoch.

4. A daughter of Absalom (also called Abishalom) ([1 Kings 15:2, 10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:2,1Kgs15:10)). She was the wife of King Rehoboam of Judah, who ruled from 930 to 913 BC. She was the mother of King Abijah, who ruled from 913 to 910 BC.

Later, Asa removed her from her role as queen mother because she made an idol for Asherah ([1 Kings 15:10–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:10-1Kgs15:13); [2 Chronicles 15:16](https://ref.ly/2Chr15:16)).

6. A sister of Huppim and Shuppim, the wife of Makir the Manassite and mother of Peresh and Sheresh ([1 Chronicles 7:15–16](https://ref.ly/1Chr7:15-1Chr7:16)).
7. A woman from the tribe of Benjamin. She was the wife of Jeiel. She was an ancestor of King Saul ([1 Chronicles 8:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:29); [9:35](https://ref.ly/1Chr9:35)).
8. A father of Hanan, one of David’s mighty warriors ([1 Chronicles 11:43](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:43)).
