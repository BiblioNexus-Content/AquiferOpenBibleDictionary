## Goliath (id: 5508)

GOLIATH
=======

Goliath was a Philistine warrior from the city of Gath who lived in the eleventh century BC. He challenged the Israelite army to battle ([1 Samuel 17](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58)). The young David later defeated him by knocking him down with a stone from his sling and then cutting off his head. 

Goliath was over 2\.7 meters (nine feet) tall. He wore armor that weighed about 56\.8 kilograms (125 pounds). He carried a spear that weighed 6\.8 kilograms (15 pounds). After Goliath's death, his sword was kept at Nob and was later given to David ([1 Samuel 21:9](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:9); [22:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:10)). 

Goliath might have been a descendant of the Anakim (see [Joshua 11:22](https://ref.ly/Josh11:22)). The Anakim were known for their unusual height. Another possibility is that Goliath's extreme height was caused by a medical condition (a growth in the pituitary gland in his brain).

There is a difference in biblical accounts about who killed Goliath. [2 Samuel 21:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19) says that Elhanan killed Goliath. However, [1 Chronicles 20:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5) says that Elhanan actually killed Goliath's brother.
