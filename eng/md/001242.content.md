## Chelleans (id: 4495)

CHELLEANS
=========

The Chelleans are a group of people mentioned in the book of Judith. They appear in a list of places that Holofernes, the top general of King Nebuchadnezzar, passed through during his military campaign ([Judith 2:23](https://ref.ly/Jdt2:23)). 

Scholars do not agree on exactly who the Chelleans were. Some have linked them to the town of Chelous (modern Khalasa), but that location is too far from the others listed in the same passage.

A better option is ancient Cholle, which was between Palmyra (also called Tadmor) and the Euphrates River. That place, now called el\-Khalle, fits well with the geography in [Judith 2:21–25](https://ref.ly/Jdt2:21-Jdt2:25).
