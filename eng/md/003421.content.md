## Landmark (id: 6677)

LANDMARK\*
==========

Inscribed stone that denoted a boundary of fields, districts, or nations ([Gn 31:51–52](https://ref.ly/Gen31:51-Gen31:52)). In most Near Eastern countries the removal of a landmark was a serious crime; in Israel it was a violation of the law of Moses ([Dt 19:14](https://ref.ly/Deut19:14); [27:17](https://ref.ly/Deut27:17)). Removing landmarks (nlt “boundary markers”) could be represented as changing ancient customs and laws ([Prv 22:28](https://ref.ly/Prov22:28); [23:10](https://ref.ly/Prov23:10); cf. [Jb 24:2](https://ref.ly/Job24:2)).
