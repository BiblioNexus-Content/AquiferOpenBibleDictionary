## Absalom (id: 3324)

ABSALOM
=======

The son of King David and his wife Maacah ([2 Samuel 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Sam3:3)). The name is also spelled Abishalom ([1 Kings 15:2, 10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:2,1Kgs15:10)). Absalom was a handsome young prince who was famous for his long, full hair ([2 Samuel 14:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:25-2Sam14:26)–[26](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:25-2Sam14:26)). He had a beautiful sister, Tamar, who was raped by their half\-brother Amnon. After dishonoring Tamar, Amnon refused to marry her ([2 Samuel 13:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam13:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:1-2Sam13:20)).

Absalom took his wounded sister into his own house. He expected his father, David, to punish Amnon for his act of incest. After two years of simmering rage and hatred, Absalom planned his revenge. He gave a feast for King David and his princes at his country home. David did not attend, but Amnon did and was murdered by Absalom’s servants after Absalom got him drunk. Absalom was afraid of King David’s anger, so he escaped across the Jordan River to King Talmai of Geshur, his mother’s father ([2 Samuel 13:21](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21-2Sam13:39)–[39](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:21-2Sam13:39)).

After three years in exile, Absalom was called back to Jerusalem because of the efforts of David’s general, Joab, and a wise woman from Tekoa. After two years, he was fully forgiven by the king ([2 Samuel 14](https://ref.ly/2Sam14:1-2Sam14:33)). He began to attempt to take the throne from his father. He began to gain public support while lowering the confidence in his father, the king ([2 Samuel 15:1–6](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam15:6)).

Eventually, Absalom planned a rebellion against David, going to Hebron to gain supporters from all over Israel. After Ahithophel, one of David’s wisest aids, supported Absalom, the prince announced that he was now king. When David heard what Absalom had done, he had to flee from Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 15](https://ref.ly/2Sam15:1-2Sam15:37); [Psalm 3](https://ref.ly/Ps3:1-Ps3:8)).

Absalom arrived in Jerusalem without a fight. Ahithophel advised him to attack David immediately with 12,000 troops. But Hushai, who was David’s spy in Absalom’s court, recommended that Absalom take some time to gather the entire nation against David. Hushai used flattery by suggesting that Absalom should lead the attack. Absalom preferred Hushai’s advice, and Ahithophel, out of desperation, committed suicide. Hushai sent Absalom’s plans to David by two priests, Zadok and Abiathar. With this information, David crossed the Jordan and camped at Mahanaim ([2 Samuel 16–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam16:1-2Sam17:29)).

Absalom brought his army across the Jordan to fight David in the forest of Ephraim. Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the Gittite, led David's army. They defeated Absalom’s forces. Absalom fled on a mule, but his long hair got caught in the branches of an oak tree. He hung from the branches by his hair, unable to do anything. Joab was chasing Absalom, and when he found him, he killed him. Joab’s men threw the body in a pit and piled stones on it ([2 Samuel 18:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:1-2Sam18:18)). 

David had ordered everyone not to hurt Absalom. So, when Absalom died, David was shocked and very upset. David cried: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!” ([2 Samuel 18:33](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:33)). In his grief, David did not notice that the rebellion was ended until Joab reminded him that David’s followers had risked their lives for him ([2 Samuel 19:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:1-2Sam19:8)–[8](https://ref.ly/2Sam19:1-2Sam19:8)). 

*See* David.
