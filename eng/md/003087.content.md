## Jeshua (Person) (id: 6344)

JESHUA (Person)
===============

1\. Levite and head of the ninth of 24 divisions of priests formed during David’s reign ([1 Chr 24:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr24:11)). He was perhaps the forefather of 973 descendants who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the exile ([Ezr 2:36](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:36); [Neh 7:39](https://ref.ly/Neh7:39)).

2\. One of the Levites assisting Kore in the distribution of the offerings among his fellow priests living in the priestly cities of Judah during the days of King Hezekiah ([2 Chr 31:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:15)).

3\. Son of Jozadak (alternately “Jehozadak”) the high priest. Jozadak was deported by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon ([1 Chr 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:14-1Chr6:15)). Jeshua, Jozadak’s successor as high priest, returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem after the exile ([Ezr 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2); [Neh 7:7](https://ref.ly/Neh7:7); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Neh12:1)). Upon arrival, he led his fellow priests in making the altar of God ([Ezr 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:2); [5:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra5:2)) and eventually headed up a construction program to rebuild the temple ([3:8](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:8)). Confirmed as God’s leader by Haggai and Zechariah ([Hg 1:1–14](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1-Hag1:14); [2:2, 4](https://ref.ly/Hag2:2,Hag2:4); [Zec 3:1–9](https://ref.ly/Zech3:1-Zech3:9); [6:11](https://ref.ly/Zech6:11)), Jeshua (alternately “Joshua” in these passages) resolutely resisted attempts by adversaries to infiltrate his people and hinder the work on the temple ([Ezr 4:3](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:3)). Joiakim was Jeshua’s son and successor as high priest, serving in the days of Nehemiah and Ezra ([Neh 12:12, 26](https://ref.ly/Neh12:12,Neh12:26)).

4\. Descendant of Pahath\-moab and the forefather of a family of Jews who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the Babylonian captivity ([Ezr 2:6](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:6); [Neh 7:11](https://ref.ly/Neh7:11)).

5\. Father of a family of Levites who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:40](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:40); [Neh 7:43](https://ref.ly/Neh7:43); [12:8](https://ref.ly/Neh12:8)). He and his sons were responsible for overseeing the workmen building the temple ([Ezr 3:9](https://ref.ly/Ezra3:9); this Jeshua may be identical with \#3 above).

6\. Levite and Jozabad’s father. Jozabad assisted Meremoth, Eleazar, and Noadiah with taking inventory of the temple’s precious metals and vessels during the days of Ezra ([Ezr 8:33](https://ref.ly/Ezra8:33)).

7\. Ezer’s father. Ezer was ruler of Mizpah, who repaired a section of the Jerusalem wall during the days of Nehemiah ([Neh 3:19](https://ref.ly/Neh3:19)).

8\. Azaniah’s son and a leader of the Levites in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. Jeshua assisted Ezra with teaching the people the law ([Neh 8:7](https://ref.ly/Neh8:7)) and later set his seal on Ezra’s covenant ([10:9](https://ref.ly/Neh10:9)).

9\. Alternate spelling of Joshua, the son of Nun, in [Nehemiah 8:17](https://ref.ly/Neh8:17). *See* Joshua (Person) \#1.
