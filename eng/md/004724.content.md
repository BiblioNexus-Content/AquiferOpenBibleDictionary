REHUM
=====

1\. One of the 12 Jewish leaders who returned from captivity with Zerubbabel ([Ezr 2:2](https://ref.ly/Ezra2:2); [Neh 7:7](https://ref.ly/Neh7:7), where “Nehum” is apparently a copyist’s error). *See* Nehum.

2\. Persian commander who, with Shimshai the scribe, wrote to Artaxerxes I, complaining of the Jews’ temple\-rebuilding project and promising dire consequences should the project be completed. The king’s response halted construction until the second year of Darius’s reign ([Ezr 4:8–23](https://ref.ly/Ezra4:8-Ezra4:23)).

3\. Levite identified as Bani’s son, who helped repair the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah’s direction ([Neh 3:17](https://ref.ly/Neh3:17)).

4\. Leader who set his seal on Ezra’s covenant ([Neh 10:25](https://ref.ly/Neh10:25)).

5\. Priest who accompanied Zerubbabel ([Neh 12:3](https://ref.ly/Neh12:3)); elsewhere he was called Harim (see nlt mg). *See* Harim \#5.
