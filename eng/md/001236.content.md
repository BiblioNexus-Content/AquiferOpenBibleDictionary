## Chaspho (id: 4489)

CHASPHO
=======

Chaspho was a town east of the Sea of Galilee. It is mentioned in 1 and 2 Maccabees.

Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus led their army into the region of Transjordan. They captured Chaspho, along with Maked, Bosor, and other cities in Gilead ([1 Maccabees 5:36](https://ref.ly/1Macc5:36)). 

Most scholars think that Chaspho is the same place called *Caspin* in [2 Maccabees 12:13](https://ref.ly/2Macc12:13). Some believe Chaspho was located at el\-Muzeirib in the Hauran plain or at Tell el\-Jamid by the Yarmuk River. But today, most scholars place it at Khisfin, about 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of the Sea of Galilee.
