## Adoni-Zedek (id: 3394)

ADONI\-ZEDEK
============

The Amorite king of Jerusalem at the time of the Israelite conquest of the promised land ([Joshua 10:1](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:5)–[5](https://ref.ly/Josh10:1-Josh10:5)). When the Amorites and Israelites fought for control of Gibeon, Joshua prayed for the sun to stand still ([Joshua 10:6](https://ref.ly/Josh10:6-Josh10:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/Josh10:6-Josh10:15)). The Israelites won a decisive victory. Adoni\-zedek and four other enemy kings were discovered hiding in a cave. Joshua executed them ([Joshua 10:16](https://ref.ly/Josh10:16-Josh10:27)–[27](https://ref.ly/Josh10:16-Josh10:27)).
