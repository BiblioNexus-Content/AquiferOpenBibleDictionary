## Shobach (id: 8439)

SHOBACH
=======

The commander of the army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah. He led the combined Ammonite\-Syrian forces in a battle against Israel. King David's army defeated Shobach's forces completely, killing Shobach himself. This decisive victory broke the Ammonite\-Syrian alliance. As a result, the kingdoms that had been under Hadadezer's control became subject to David instead ([2 Samuel 10:16–18](https://ref.ly/2Sam10:16-2Sam10:18)). He is also called Shophach in [1 Chronicles 19:16–18](https://ref.ly/1Chr19:16-1Chr19:18).
