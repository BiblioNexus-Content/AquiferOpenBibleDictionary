## Rape (id: 7942)

RAPE
====

The act of a man forcing a woman to have sexual intercourse against her will. The Bible records two clear examples in the Old Testament:

1. Shechem the son of Hamor, a Hivite, raped Dinah (see [Genesis 34:2–7](https://ref.ly/Gen34:2-Gen34:7))
2. The son of King David, Amnon, raped his sister Tamar ([2 Samuel 13:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam13:14))

In both examples, the brothers of the women took revenge for the rape of their sister.

*See also* Dinah; Tamar (Person) \#2.
