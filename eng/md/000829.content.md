## Ben-Abinadab (id: 4097)

BEN\-ABINADAB
=============

One of 12 officers chosen to collect food for King Solomon’s household. His administrative district was found in the area around Naphath\-dor, a city on the coast south of Mount Carmel ([1 Kings 4:11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:11)). The name means “son of Abinadab” and probably means that Ben\-abinadab was the son of Solomon’s uncle Abinadab ([1 Samuel 16:8](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:8); [1 Chronicles 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Chr2:13)).
