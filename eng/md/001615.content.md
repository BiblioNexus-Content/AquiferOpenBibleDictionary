## Dives (id: 4865)

DIVES
=====

The traditional name of the rich man in Jesus's parable about the beggar Lazarus ([Luke 16:19](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31)[31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31)). It came from the Latin term *dives,* translating a Greek word for “rich” or “wealthy.” Though the parable did not name the rich man, the church accepted this name by the third century. A second\-century Egyptian scribe gave him the name “*Neves*,” meaning “nothing.” 

*See* Lazarus \#1.
