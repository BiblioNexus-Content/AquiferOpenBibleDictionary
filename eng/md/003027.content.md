## Jehoram (id: 6282)

JEHORAM
=======

1. The son of Jehoshaphat and the fifth king of Judah. He was king from 853 to 841 BC. He was also calledJoram. The rule of the dynasty of Omri in the northern kingdom of Israel was from 885 to 841 BC. Before this time, he relationship between Judah and Israel was not good. The political power and economic strength of the united kingdom had disappeared long ago.

    Power and wealth had decreased because of Egyptian control under Shishak and because of civil war ([2 Chronicles 12](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:1-2Chr12:16)). These wars included:

    * the failed meeting at Shechem (chapter [10](https://ref.ly/2Chr10:1-2Chr10:19))
        * King Rehoboam of Judah fighting against King Jeroboam of Israel ([12:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr12:15))
        * King Abijah of Judah fighting against King Jeroboam of Israel ([13:1–22](https://ref.ly/2Chr13:1-2Chr13:22))
        * King Asa of Judah fighting against King Baasha of Israel ([16:1–4](https://ref.ly/2Chr16:1-2Chr16:4)).
        Yet, the dynasty of Omri in the mid\-ninth century BC put aside family rivalry. They tried to make a new alliance between the two nations.

    The two kingdoms of Judah and Israel were facing growing threats from nearby peoples. These included the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Syrians, Philistines, Arabs, and Assyrians. King Ahab, the second king of the dynasty of Omri, formed diplomatic ties with Phoenicia and Judah ([1 Kings 16:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:31); [22:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:4)). During this time, Israel and Judah often joined together for military campaigns ([1 Kings 22](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:1-1Kgs22:53); [2 Kings 3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:1-2Kgs3:27); [8:28](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:28)). But these political alliances also caused problems. The worship of Baal and Asherah (false gods) spread into Judah and Israel and led many people away from worshiping the true God ([1 Kings 16:31–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:31-1Kgs16:33); [2 Kings 3:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:2); [2 Chronicles 21:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:11)). This was the political and religious situation when Jehoram ruled over Judah.

    Jehoram may have served alongside his father as co\-ruler as early as 853 BC. But Jehoram was the only ruler for eight years (from 848 to 841 BC). His time as king was filled with unnecessary fighting against his own family and turning away from God. His father had given generous gifts to Jehoram's six brothers, but Jehoram quickly changed this after he became king ([2 Chronicles 21:2–3](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:2-2Chr21:3)). He not only ordered that his brothers be killed, but also several Israelite princes. This removed anyone who might challenge his power (verse[4](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:4)). He also brought back idol worship that his father had tried to stop by rebuilding the forbidden worship places called "the high places" (verse[11](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:11)).

    Jehoram was likely influenced by his wife, Athaliah, who was the daughter of Jezebel ([2 Kings 8:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:18)). As her mother had done in Israel, Athaliah brought Baal worship into Judah. As a result, Elijah the prophet announced God's judgment on Jehoram and the people of Judah. This curse brought a great plague upon the Jehoram's people, children, wives, and possessions. Jehoram himself suffered from a terrible intestinal disease. Even though wickedness spread throughout Judah, the Lord did not destroy the southern kingdom. This was because of his promise to David ([2 Kings 8:19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:19); compare [2 Samuel 7:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:16)).

    Politically, Judah became weak during Jehoram's rule. The kingdom lost control of Edom ([2 Chronicles 21:9](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:9)). The kingdom was attacked by the Philistines and the Arabs. These attacks left Jehoram with almost nothing. He lost his possessions, his wives, and all his sons except for Jehoahaz (also called Ahaziah), his youngest son (verses [16–17](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:16-2Chr21:17)). When Jehoram died, the people did not honor him. He was not buried in the royal tomb in the city of David where the other kings were buried (verses [19–20](https://ref.ly/2Chr21:19-2Chr21:20)).

2. The son of Ahab and Jezebel. He was the tenth king of the northern kingdom of Israel. He was king from 852 to 841 BC. He was also called Joram. He became king after his brother Ahaziah. Ahaziah died unexpectedly, which led to Jehoram becoming king in Samaria ([2 Kings 1:2, 17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs1:2,2Kgs1:17)). He ruled at the same time as these kings of Judah: Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah.

    Jehoram spent much of his time dealing with the growing power of two neighboring kingdoms: Moab and Syria. When Moab stopped paying its yearly tax to Israel, Jehoram asked for help from both Jehoshaphat and from Edom, which was controlled by Judah at that time. Jehoram and Jehoshaphat joined their armies with the king of Edom's army. However, they had to stop their attack on Moab when they ran out of water.

    They were unsure whether they should advance with their troops. So, they summoned Elisha the prophet. They asked him to find out what God wanted them to do about their military campaign. Because Elisha respected Jehoshaphat greatly, the prophet asked God for guidance. God blessed them and provided plenty of water. The Bible tells us that Israel's army defeated the Moabites in the battle. It also describes a terrible incident where the Moabite king sacrificed a human being. After winning the battle, Israel's army went back home ([2 Kings 3:4–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:4-2Kgs3:27)).

    The fight against Syria was less successful. Jehoram was wounded in battle. He had to leave Ramoth\-gilead in Transjordan (east of the Jordan River) and go back to his palace in Jezreel to recover ([2 Kings 8:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:29)). While he was there, one of his generals named Jehu rebelled against him. God had chosen Jehu and declared him to be the new king of Israel. Jehu confronted Jehoram and his nephew, Ahaziah, who was king of Judah. This meeting ended with both the kings of Israel and Judah being killed([2 Kings 9:14–24, 27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:14-2Kgs9:24,2Kgs9:27)).

    Ahaziah was buried in the tomb of the kings in Jerusalem (verse [28](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:28)). But Jehoram's body was thrown into the field of Naboth outside the city of Jezreel. This was the appropriate judgment against the last king of the wicked dynasty of Omri (verses [25–26](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:25-2Kgs9:26)).

3. A Levite member of a traveling group of scholars. This group of scholars taught the people of Judah from the Book of the Law during the rule of King Jehoshaphat ([2 Chronicles 17:7–9](https://ref.ly/2Chr17:7-2Chr17:9)).
