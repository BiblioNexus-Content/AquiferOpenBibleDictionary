## Harod (id: 5677)

HAROD
=====

1. A spring which Gideon and his army camped next to before their encounter with the Midianites ([Judges 7:1](https://ref.ly/Judg7:1)). It might be the same spring by which Saul and his army set up their tents before their battle with the Philistines ([1 Samuel 29:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam29:1)). The spring of Harod is at ‘Ain Jalud by the northern side of Mt Gilboa. This is about 3\.2 kilometers (two miles) southeast of Zerin.
2. Home of Shammah and Elika, two of the mighty men of King David ([2 Samuel 23:25](https://ref.ly/2Sam23:25)). In [1 Chronicles 11:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:27), Elika's name is not included, and Shammoth (also called Shammah) is listed as a Harorite instead of a Harodite. The term "Harorite" is likely the result of a later copying error where the person copying the text mistook the Hebrew letter "d" for an "r."
