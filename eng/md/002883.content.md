## Jaare-oregim (id: 6135)

JAARE\-OREGIM
=============

A name that appears in some Bible translations of [2 Samuel 21:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:19). This name resulted from a scribal error in the Hebrew text. The original text likely referred to *Jair*, as reflected in the Berean Standard Bible and many other modern translations. The error happened because the word *oregim* (which means "weavers") was accidentally copied twice from later in the verse. Many scholars and translators correct this mistake by following the parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 20:5](https://ref.ly/1Chr20:5), which names *Jair* (or *Jaor* in some manuscripts).

*See* Jair \#3.
