## Jaar (id: 6137)

JAAR
====

*Jaar* is the most common Hebrew word for “forest.” It refers to forests generally ([Isaiah 10:18](https://ref.ly/Isa10:18)). It also refers to specific forests, such as the “forest of Ephraim” ([2 Samuel 18:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam18:6)) and the “forest of Hereth” ([1 Samuel 22:5](https://ref.ly/1Sam22:5)). Both of these forests are connected to King David's story.

The word *jaar* also appears in the name of one of King Solomon's buildings called “the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon” ([1 Kings 7:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs7:2)). This building seems to have gotten its name because it used a lot of cedar wood in its construction.

Only one mention of “Jaar” seems to be a proper name. In [Psalm 132:6](https://ref.ly/Ps132:6), there is a reference to moving the ark of the covenant from Kiriath\-jearim to Jerusalem. In this verse, the place is called "the field of Jaar" (or “the wood” in the King James Version). This might be a shortened poetic way of referring to Kiriath\-jearim.
