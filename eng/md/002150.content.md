## Gehazi (id: 5405)

GEHAZI
======

Servant of Elisha ([2 Kgs 5:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:25)) who instructed the prophet how best to recompense the generous Shunammite woman for her kindness to him ([4:11–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:11-2Kgs4:17)). Gehazi took Elisha’s staff to use in reviving the woman’s dead son, but he was unsuccessful (v [31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:31)), and the prophet himself had to revive the child (vv [32–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:32-2Kgs4:37)). His greed in securing from Naaman presents declined by Elisha resulted in his contracting Naaman’s leprosy ([5:20–23, 27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:20-2Kgs5:23,2Kgs5:27)). In [2 Kings 8:1–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:1-2Kgs8:6) Gehazi again encountered the Shunammite woman as she was petitioning the king of Israel.
