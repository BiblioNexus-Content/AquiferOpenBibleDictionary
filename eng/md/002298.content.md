## Gur, Ascent of (id: 5552)

GUR, Ascent of
==============

Elevated place near Ibleam where Ahaziah, king of Judah, was smitten by the soldiers of Jehu of the northern kingdom. From Gur, Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died ([2 Kgs 9:27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs9:27)). Though its location is uncertain, some identify it with the Akkadian Gurra, about one\-half mile (800 meters) south of Jenin.
