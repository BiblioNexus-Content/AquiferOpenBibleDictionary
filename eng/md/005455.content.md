## Tahpanhes (id: 8716)

TAHPANHES
=========

Important Egyptian center in the eastern Delta. Listed with Memphis among Israel’s enemies ([Jer 2:16](https://ref.ly/Jer2:16)), it is the place to which Jews fled after the murder of Gedaliah in 586 BC when Jeremiah was taken to Egypt ([43:7–9](https://ref.ly/Jer43:7-Jer43:9); [44:1](https://ref.ly/Jer44:1); [46:14](https://ref.ly/Jer46:14)). Ezekiel prophesied doom against this city (alternately spelled Tehaphnehes in [Ez 30:18](https://ref.ly/Ezek30:18), rsv).

Today the site is identified with Tell Dephneh (Defenneh), 26 miles (41\.8 kilometers) southwest of Port Said. There is little evidence of occupation here before the time of Psammetichus I (664–610 BC), who established a fortress at the site and left a garrison of Greek mercenaries. Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, where Jeremiah buried stones as a promise of Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion ([Jer 43:9](https://ref.ly/Jer43:9)), has been identified with the fortress of Psammetichus. A fragmentary Neo\-Babylonian text of the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar refers to operations against Pharaoh Amasis and a Greek garrison.
