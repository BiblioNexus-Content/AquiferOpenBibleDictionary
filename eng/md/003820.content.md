## Meshech (id: 7080)

MESHECH
=======

1\. Son of Japheth and Noah’s grandson ([Gn 10:2](https://ref.ly/Gen10:2)). His descendants are usually mentioned in connection with Tubal, Gog, or Magog ([Ps 120:5](https://ref.ly/Ps120:5); [Ez 27:13](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:13); [32:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek32:26); [38:2–3](https://ref.ly/Ezek38:2-Ezek38:3); [39:1](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:1)). They are called Muski in Assyrian records and inhabited the mountains north of Assyria during the reigns of Tiglath\-pileser I (1115–1102 BC), Shalmaneser III (859–824 BC), and Sargon (722–705 BC). The people of Meshech are characterized as aggressive and pagan, traders in bronze and slaves with Tyre.

2\. Shem’s son according to [1 Chronicles 1:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr1:17), but rendered Mash in the parallel passage in [Genesis 10:23](https://ref.ly/Gen10:23). The latter is generally accepted.
