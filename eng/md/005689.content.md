## Tubal-Cain (id: 8938)

TUBAL\-CAIN
===========

Son of Lamech by his wife Zillah ([Gn 4:22](https://ref.ly/Gen4:22)). He was “a forger of all instruments of bronze and iron.” Though the text does not claim that he was the first or the “father” of all ironworkers, many scholars think that the text originally paralleled verses [20](https://ref.ly/Gen4:20) and [21](https://ref.ly/Gen4:21) to imply that he was the first.

* **Associated Passages:** GEN 4:20; GEN 4:21; GEN 4:22
