======

A plant with a bulb that people grow for cooking. The Israelites remembered eating garlic in Egypt ([Numbers 11:5](https://ref.ly/Num11:5)). It has a strong flavor and smell that many people enjoy in their food. People have used garlic for thousands of years, both as food and as medicine.

The common garlic (*Allium sativum*) is a hardy, bulbous perennial plant that is grown in Europe, western Asia, and Egypt. The leaves are narrow, flat, and ribbon\-like. Garlic is extremely popular with people who live in the Mediterranean region.

Garlic is closely related to onions (*Allium cepa*).
