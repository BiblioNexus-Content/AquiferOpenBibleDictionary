## Bethany (id: 4153)

BETHANY
=======

1\. A village on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. This village is sometimes called "Bethany on the Mount of Olives." It is about a mile and a half (2\.4 kilometers) east of Jerusalem. Jesus and his disciples sometimes stayed in Bethany when in Judea. For example, they stayed here when they attended temple observances during Passover ([Matthew 21:17](https://ref.ly/Matt21:17); [Mark 11:11](https://ref.ly/Mark11:11)). Jesus was eating at the home of Simon the leper in Bethany when a woman came and anointed his head with costly perfume ([Matthew 26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [Mark 14:3–9](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3-Mark14:9)). 

Bethany was also the home of Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus. This is where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead ([John 11:1, 18](https://ref.ly/John11:1,John11:18)). The village was near Bethphage on an approach to Jerusalem ([Mark 11:1](https://ref.ly/Mark11:1); [Luke 19:29](https://ref.ly/Luke19:29)) that Jesus followed in preparation for his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. In Bethany, Jesus blessed his disciples after the resurrection and parted from them ([Luke 24:50](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50)). Today the town is called el\-Azariyeh (the place of Lazarus).

2\. A village on “the other side of the Jordan” (the east side), where John the Baptist baptized ([John 1:28](https://ref.ly/John1:28)). It is often called "Bethany beyond the Jordan."
