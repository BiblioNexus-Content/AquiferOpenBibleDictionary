## Abimelech (id: 3305)

ABIMELECH
=========

A royal title for Philistine rulers. It is similar to the title “pharaoh” used by the Egyptians and “agag” used by the Amalekites.

1. The King of Gerar in Abraham’s time. Gerar was a city near Gaza. Abraham, out of fear for his life, told people his wife Sarah was his sister ([Genesis 20:1](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18)–[18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:1-Gen20:18)). He had done this before in Egypt ([Genesis 12:10](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20)–[20](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10-Gen12:20)). Sarah was taken into Abimelech’s harem, but God warned Abimelech in a dream that Sarah was married and he would die if he touched her. Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham. Later, Abraham and Abimelech made a treaty to clarify water rights in the Negev Desert at Beersheba ([Genesis 21:22](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:34)–[34](https://ref.ly/Gen21:22-Gen21:34)).
2. The King of Gerar in Isaac’s time. Isaac, like his father Abraham, told people his wife Rebekah was his sister. Abimelech was aware of the danger because he knew what happened to the king before him. So Abimelech protected Rebekah by declaring anyone who touched her or Isaac would be put to death ([Genesis 26:1](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1-Gen26:11)–[11](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1-Gen26:11)). Due to disputes over water and overcrowding, Abimelech asked Isaac to leave the Philistine territory ([Genesis 26:12](https://ref.ly/Gen26:12-Gen26:22)–[22](https://ref.ly/Gen26:12-Gen26:22)). They eventually made a peace treaty at Beersheba, renewing the one made between Abraham and the earlier Abimelech ([Genesis 26:26](https://ref.ly/Gen26:26-Gen26:33)–[33](https://ref.ly/Gen26:26-Gen26:33)).
3. Gideon’s son by a concubine in Shechem ([Judges 8:31](https://ref.ly/Judg8:31)). After his father’s death, Abimelech worked with his mother’s family to kill his 70 half brothers. Jotham was the only one that escaped ([Judges 9:1–5](https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:5)). In his third year as ruler, he harshly stopped a rebellion ([Judges 9:22–49](https://ref.ly/Judg9:22-Judg9:49)). Eventually, he was killed when a woman dropped a millstone on his head. Abimelech asked his armor bearer to kill him with a sword so that no one could say he had been killed by a woman ([Judges 9:53–57](https://ref.ly/Judg9:53-Judg9:57)).
4. Achish, king of the Philistine city of Gath ([1 Samuel 21:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15)–[15](https://ref.ly/1Sam21:10-1Sam21:15)).
5. Abiathar’s son, a priest who served with Zadok in David’s time ([1 Chronicles 18:16](https://ref.ly/1Chr18:16)).
