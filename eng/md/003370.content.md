## Kiss, Kiss of Peace (id: 6627)

KISS, KISS OF PEACE
===================

A common way to show love and fellowship in biblical times. 

Kissing appears in the Bible in many different contexts:

* Kisses were shared among relatives and friends as a sign of affection ([Genesis 29:11](https://ref.ly/Gen29:11); [33:4](https://ref.ly/Gen33:4)).
* Sometimes kisses had a sensual meaning ([Proverbs 7:6–13](https://ref.ly/Prov7:6-Prov7:13); [Song of Solomon 1:2](https://ref.ly/Song1:2)).
* Kissing was also a way to show respect or worship ([1 Samuel 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:1); [Job 31:27](https://ref.ly/Job31:27)), though it could be seen as wrong in certain situations ([1 Kings 19:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:18); [Hosea 13:2](https://ref.ly/Hos13:2)).
* A kiss could be used to betray someone, as seen in the story of Jesus' betrayal ([Matthew 26:48–49](https://ref.ly/Matt26:48-Matt26:49)).

In the New Testament, there are five mentions of a “holy kiss,” also known as the “kiss of peace:” 

1. [Romans 16:16](https://ref.ly/Rom16:16)
2. [1 Corinthians 16:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:20)
3. [2 Corinthians 13:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:12)
4. [1 Thessalonians 5:26](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:26)
5. [1 Peter 5:14](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:14)

This kiss was a symbol of Christian love and unity. Although the Bible doesn’t give detailed instructions, it was a gesture of friendship and commitment among early Christians ([1 Thessalonians 5:25–27](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:25-1Thess5:27)).

By the late second century, this practice became a part of church liturgy. Justin Martyr described it as a kiss exchanged among the congregation after prayer. Over time, it was moved to before Holy Communion and eventually replaced by a simple bow in many churches. Today, some churches still have different forms of this practice.
