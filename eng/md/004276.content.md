## Outward Man (id: 7534)

OUTWARD MAN
===========

A part of a person that can be seen by others. Unlike “inner man,” do not confuse the term with other biblical and nonbiblical terms like: 

* “Old man and new man”
* “Natural man and spiritual man”
* “Body and soul”

Near Eastern, especially Semitic, thinking dealt in wholes, not dichotomies. The inner and outward man were viewed as parts of a whole, not opposites.

The phrase appears only in [2 Corinthians 4:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:16). Similar terms, such as “outward appearance,” are in other verses ([1 Samuel 16:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:7); [Matthew 23:27](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27-Matt23:28)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27-Matt23:28)[28](https://ref.ly/Matt23:27-Matt23:28); [2 Corinthians 10:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:7)). The Bible says a person's appearance should match their inner self. The Talmud says, “A scribe whose inner man does not correspond to the outer is no scribe.”
