## Exaltation of Christ (id: 5201)

EXALTATION OF CHRIST
====================

The glory and authority Jesus received after his work on Earth ended in suffering and death. This exaltation is both the completion of his sacrifice for humanity and the reward for his complete obedience to God the Father. The exaltation includes three key events: 

1. Jesus's resurrection (coming back to life after death)
2. Jesus's ascension (going up to heaven)
3. Jesus's enthronement in heaven (taking his place as ruler in God's kingdom)

During his earthly ministry, Jesus predicted that he would suffer, die, and be buried ([Matthew 20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28); [John 3:14](https://ref.ly/John3:14); [6:51](https://ref.ly/John6:51); [10:11](https://ref.ly/John10:11)). He also predicted that God the Father would raise him to a position of power and glory in heaven ([Luke 24:26](https://ref.ly/Luke24:26); [John 17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5)). Jesus showed this pattern of suffering followed by glory when he met some Greeks who wanted to see him ([John 12:20](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:36)[–](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:36)[36](https://ref.ly/John12:20-John12:36)). Jesus said that, through his suffering and resurrection, even gentiles (non\-Jewish people) could know God. When Jesus said, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified” ([John 12:23](https://ref.ly/John12:23)), he meant that he would be honored and glorified in heaven after his suffering. This teaching became the foundation for the early church's understanding of Jesus's exaltation.

### The Resurrection: Jesus Came Back to Life After Death

The resurrection of Jesus is the first event in his exaltation. It is a central teaching of the New Testament ([Acts 2:24, 32](https://ref.ly/Acts2:24,Acts2:32); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:10](https://ref.ly/Acts4:10); [Romans 1:4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:4); [1 Corinthians 15:4](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:4)). From the beginning, Christians believed that at a specific time and place, Jesus rose from the dead and entered eternal life. The unique event of Jesus's resurrection sets Christianity apart from other religions. The New Testament shows that Jesus predicted his resurrection. When the Jews questioned his authority, Jesus said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again” ([John 2:19](https://ref.ly/John2:19)). After Peter confessed that Jesus was the Son of God, Jesus told his disciples he would be killed and then raised on the third day ([Matthew 16:21](https://ref.ly/Matt16:21)). He repeated this to his disciples in Galilee, saying he would be killed and raised on the third day: “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised to life” ([Matthew 17:22](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23)[–](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23)[23](https://ref.ly/Matt17:22-Matt17:23)). The New Testament emphasizes the certainty of Jesus's resurrection three days after his death.

The New Testament also explains the significance of Jesus's resurrection:

1. It proves Christ’s power over death ([Acts 2:24](https://ref.ly/Acts2:24); [1 Corinthians 15:54](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:54-1Cor15:56)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:54-1Cor15:56)[56](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:54-1Cor15:56))
2. It confirms Christ’s teachings, particularly his claim to be the Son of God ([Acts 2:36](https://ref.ly/Acts2:36); [Romans 1:4](https://ref.ly/Rom1:4))
3. It shows God approved of Jesus's suffering ([Philippians 2:8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8-Phil2:9)[–](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8-Phil2:9)[9](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8-Phil2:9))
4. It allows believers to be made right with God ([Romans 4:25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:25)) and experience spiritual rebirth ([1 Peter 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3))
5. It guarantees that Christians will also be resurrected ([Romans 6:5](https://ref.ly/Rom6:5); [1 Corinthians 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22-1Cor15:24)[–](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22-1Cor15:24)[24](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:22-1Cor15:24))

The New Testament teaches that God raised Jesus from the dead ([Psalm 16:10](https://ref.ly/Ps16:10); [Acts 2:32](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32); [Ephesians 1:19](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)[–](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)[20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)), but it also says that Jesus had the power to raise himself ([John 2:19](https://ref.ly/John2:19); [10:17](https://ref.ly/John10:17-John10:18)[–](https://ref.ly/John10:17-John10:18)[18](https://ref.ly/John10:17-John10:18)).

### The Ascension: Jesus Went Up to Heaven

The ascension represents the second phase of the exaltation of Christ. According to the New Testament ([Luke 24:50](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:51)[–](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:51)[51](https://ref.ly/Luke24:50-Luke24:51); [Acts 1:9](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11)[11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11)), Jesus ascended into heaven 40 days after his resurrection. In the Gospel of John, Jesus often mentions his ascension ([John 3:13](https://ref.ly/John3:13); [6:62](https://ref.ly/John6:62); [14:12](https://ref.ly/John14:12); [20:17](https://ref.ly/John20:17)), showing he believed he would go to a real place in heaven ([John 14:2](https://ref.ly/John14:2)). The apostle Paul connected the ascension with Christ's victory over his enemies and the giving of spiritual gifts to the church ([Ephesians 4:8](https://ref.ly/Eph4:8)). Jesus, having won the victory, returned to the throne of his Father to bless his followers. Paul describes this event as the "mystery" of the Christian faith: that Christ, who "appeared in the flesh," was "taken up into glory" ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim3:16)).

The Epistle to the Hebrews links Jesus's ascension with his role as High Priest in the heavenly temple. Jesus, who resisted all earthly temptations, "passed through the heavens." He now fully sympathizes with his followers. He offers them grace in times of need ([Hebrews 4:14](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)[16](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb4:16)). Hebrews says Jesus ascended to the heavenly temple ([Hebrews 6:19](https://ref.ly/Heb6:19)). He brought his blood ([Hebrews 9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12)) as the ultimate sacrifice to appear before God for humanity ([Hebrews 9:24](https://ref.ly/Heb9:24)).

The New Testament gives great importance to this part of Jesus's exaltation. Through his ascension to the Father, Jesus:

1. Demonstrated his victory over every earthly enemy ([Ephesians 4:8](https://ref.ly/Eph4:8))
2. Sent the promised Holy Spirit ([John 16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7); [Acts 2:33](https://ref.ly/Acts2:33)), which could only happen after his glorification ([John 7:39](https://ref.ly/John7:39))
3. Began his work as the High Priest in heaven ([Hebrews 6:20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:20))

### The Enthronement: Jesus Took His Place as Ruler in God's Kingdom

The final stage of Jesus's exaltation is his enthronement at the right hand of God the Father. After his suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension, the Bible describes Jesus as sitting at the right hand of God. The phrase “right hand of God” ([Acts 7:55](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)[–](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)[56](https://ref.ly/Acts7:55-Acts7:56)) is a figurative way of saying that Jesus now has universal power and authority in the presence of God. This part of Jesus's exaltation fulfills his prayer recorded in [John 17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5): “And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed.”

In the Old Testament, God is often described as seated on the throne of the universe. This shows his: 

* Sovereignty ([1 Kings 22:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:19); [Psalm 99:1](https://ref.ly/Ps99:1))
* Majesty ([Isaiah 6:1](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:4)[–](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:4)[4](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:4))
* Holiness ([Psalm 47:8](https://ref.ly/Ps47:8))

In Eastern cultures, being invited to sit at the right hand of a ruler was a sign of great honor and authority ([1 Kings 2:19](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:19)). The Old Testament predicted that the exalted Christ would receive this special honor (see [Psalm 8:5](https://ref.ly/Ps8:5), which is quoted in [Hebrews 2:8](https://ref.ly/Heb2:8); also see [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)).

The Epistle to the Hebrews focuses on Christ's exaltation. It sees his heavenly enthronement as the result of his completed sacrifice. It also is the start of his role as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary. [Hebrews 8:1](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:2)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:2)[2](https://ref.ly/Heb8:1-Heb8:2)presents Christ as seated at the right hand of the throne of God in heaven, serving as a minister in the heavenly temple. This enthronement confirms the end of Jesus's work on earth and his new role as the mediator of a better covenant. [Hebrews 10:11](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:18)[–](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:18)[18](https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:18) contrasts the Old Testament priests' repeated, ineffective sacrifices with Christ's once\-for\-all, effective sacrifice. He now sits at God's right hand, interceding for believers.
