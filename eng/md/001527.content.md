DAY’S JOURNEY
=============

A way of estimating distances in Bible times. A day’s journey was about 32\.2 kilometers (20 miles) but depended on such things as the mode of travel, the terrain, and the weather. [Exodus 3:18](https://ref.ly/Exod3:18), [Numbers 11:31](https://ref.ly/Num11:31), [1 Kings 19:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:4), and [Luke 2:44](https://ref.ly/Luke2:44) all mention a day's journey.

Scripture also refers to a Sabbath day’s journey ([Acts 1:12](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12)). A Sabbath day’s journey was probably about one kilometer (3500 feet).
