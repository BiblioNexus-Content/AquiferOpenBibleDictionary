## Quail (id: 7880)

QUAIL
=====

A quail is a short, stocky bird with a bill and feet like a chicken. These features help it eat seeds and insects. The common quail (*Coturnix coturnix*) is the smallest member of the poultry family that also includes pheasants and partridges.

Quail are about 25\.4 centimeters (10 inches) long. They have small, rounded wings and a white belly. When startled, they burst from grass or bushes with a whirring sound. A female may lay up to 18 eggs. If the female dies, the male may care for the young.

Quail from the Mediterranean region spend the winter in Sudan. In spring they migrate north in large flocks. Quail cannot fly for long periods. Instead, they ride wind currents to stay in the air.

### Quail in the Bible

Very large flocks of quail fed the Israelites twice during their time in the wilderness of Sinai ([Exodus 16:13](https://ref.ly/Exod16:13); [Numbers 11:31–32](https://ref.ly/Num11:31-Num11:32); [Psalm 105:40](https://ref.ly/Ps105:40)). The second time, they were likely flying along the Gulf of Aqaba and were blown off course by an east wind ([Numbers 11:31](https://ref.ly/Num11:31); [Psalm 78:26–28](https://ref.ly/Ps78:26-Ps78:28)).

Because quail cannot fly for long, they stay low to the ground, about two cubits, or 101\.6 centimeters (40 inches). When tired, they could be caught by hand ([Numbers 11:31–32](https://ref.ly/Num11:31-Num11:32)).

Quail were considered clean food under the law of Moses. They were valued as the most delicate of all game birds. People often preserved them by drying them in the sun.
