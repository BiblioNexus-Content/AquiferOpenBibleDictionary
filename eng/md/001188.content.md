## Cassia (id: 4443)

CASSIA
======

A type of tree that grows in tropical Asia. The bark of cassia is used as a spice that tastes similar to cinnamon but is not as high quality. 

The "cassia" mentioned in the Bible comes from the cassia bark tree (*Cinnamomum cassia*). It is one of the ingredients used in holy anointing oil ([Exodus 30:24](https://ref.ly/Exod30:24)). It was also a valuable trade item ([Ezekiel 27:19](https://ref.ly/Ezek27:19)). comes from the cassia bark tree (*Cinnamomum cassia*). 

In [Psalm 45:8](https://ref.ly/Ps45:8), the reference seems to be to a different plant called Indian orris (*Saussurea lappa*).
