## Eliel (id: 5005)

ELIEL
=====

1\. Warrior and head of a family of the half\-tribe of Manasseh that lived east of the Jordan River ([1 Chr 5:24](https://ref.ly/1Chr5:24)).

2\. Tola’s son, a Kohathite who was one of the Levitical singers in the time of David ([1 Chr 6:34](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:34)); possibly the same as Eliab ([1 Chr 6:27](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:27)).

3\. Shimei’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe ([1 Chr 8:20](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:20)).

4\. Shashak’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe ([1 Chr 8:22](https://ref.ly/1Chr8:22)).

5\. Warrior among David’s mighty men ([1 Chr 11:46](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:46)), called a Mahavite.

6\. Another warrior among David’s mighty men ([1 Chr 11:47](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:47)).

7\. Warrior from the Gadites who joined David at Ziklag in his struggle against King Saul. Eliel was one of those experts with a shield and spear. Whether the Eliel of [1 Chronicles 12:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr12:11) should be equated with either of the two Eliels of [1 Chronicles 11:46–47](https://ref.ly/1Chr11:46-1Chr11:47) is impossible to say.

8\. Levite and chief of the family of Hebron, who was involved in bringing the ark to Jerusalem in David’s time ([1 Chr 15:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:9)).

9\. Priest who assisted in bringing the ark to Jerusalem ([1 Chr 15:11](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:11)); possibly the same as \#8 above.

10\. Levite who assisted Conaniah in the administration of the tithes, contributions, and dedicated things given to the temple during Hezekiah’s reign ([2 Chr 31:13](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:13)).
