## Commandment, the New (id: 4619)

COMMANDMENT, The New
====================

The New Commandment is Christ’s instruction for Christians to love one another. The term “new commandment” appears four times in the New Testament, all in the writings of John ([John 13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34); [1 John 2:7, 8](https://ref.ly/1John2:7); [2 John 1:5](https://ref.ly/2John1:5)). Jesus first gave this command to his disciples on the night he was arrested: “A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another” ([John 13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34)). This command appears in other places in the Bible ([John 15:12, 17](https://ref.ly/John15:12); [Romans 13:8](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8); [1 Peter 1:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:22); [1 John 3:11, 23](https://ref.ly/1John3:11); [4:7, 11–12](https://ref.ly/1John4:7)), but it is not called “new” in those passages.

Love as a Commandment
---------------------

Jesus had already told his disciples to love their enemies ([Matthew 5:43–45](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:45)) and to love their neighbors as themselves ([Luke 10:25–37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37)). The “new commandment” focused on Christians loving each other. It did not replace the other two love commands. Jesus intended this command to create a strong and convincing testimony for those outside the church. It would show that: 

1. His followers loved one another in a Christlike way.
2. True community can be found “in Christ.”
3. What Jesus said about himself and his mission was true ([John 13:35](https://ref.ly/John13:35); [17:21–23](https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23)).

Jesus used the same word for “commandment” that described the Old Testament law, giving his new commandment the same authority. The Old Testament law also included commands to love ([Leviticus 19:18, 34](https://ref.ly/Lev19:18); [Deuteronomy 10:19](https://ref.ly/Deut10:19)). The apostle Paul referred to love as the “law of Christ” ([Galatians 6:2](https://ref.ly/Gal6:2)), and James called the love command the “royal law” ([James 2:8](https://ref.ly/Jas2:8)) and “the perfect law of liberty” ([1:25](https://ref.ly/Jas1:25); [2:12](https://ref.ly/Jas2:12)).

The word “commandment” had another meaning as well. Many Jews in Jesus’s time wrongly thought that obeying commandments would make them worthy of God’s blessing ([Romans 8:3](https://ref.ly/Rom8:3); [Galatians 3:2](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2)). However, Jesus made it clear that love follows from God's blessing. It is not a requirement to earn it. For Jesus, the commandment showed how the blessed should behave. Disciples were commanded to love in the same way that branches are “commanded” to bear fruit: by staying connected to the vine (Jesus), Christians can love ([John 15:4](https://ref.ly/John15:4)).

What Made It New?
-----------------

The new commandment gets its special character from the “new covenant” ([Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20); [1 Corinthians 11:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25)), which Jesus established at the Last Supper. Under the new covenant, God “writes” his law on believers’ hearts ([Hebrews 10:16](https://ref.ly/Heb10:16)). This means he actively works in them through the Holy Spirit ([Ezekiel 36:27](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:27); [2 Corinthians 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:3)), giving them a new desire to obey him ([Romans 8:4](https://ref.ly/Rom8:4); [Galatians 5:16](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16)). The new commandment to love is the main part of the new covenant ([Romans 13:8, 10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8); [Galatians 5:14](https://ref.ly/Gal5:14)). Obedience is therefore a gift, because “love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God” ([1 John 4:7](https://ref.ly/1John4:7)). Love is the result of faith ([1 John 3:23](https://ref.ly/1John3:23)) and is part of the gospel itself ([1 John 3:11](https://ref.ly/1John3:11)).

The close connection between the new covenant and the new commandment might explain why the command to love was called “new.” Christ’s coming was the beginning of a new age. John wrote, "The darkness is fading and the true light is already shining” ([1 John 2:8](https://ref.ly/1John2:8)). As Jesus prepared to return to heaven ([John 13:33–35](https://ref.ly/John13:33-John13:35)), he gave a single commandment. It was to guide his disciples until the Judgment Day ([John 5:28–29](https://ref.ly/John5:28-John5:29); [1 John 4:17](https://ref.ly/1John4:17)). Obeying the new commandment would mark them as Jesus’s disciples during his absence ([John 13:35](https://ref.ly/John13:35); [17:21–23](https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23)). The command was new because it had a special purpose in this new era.

What made the era new was that Jesus Christ’s coming revealed God the Father in a way that had never been seen before ([John 1:18](https://ref.ly/John1:18); [10:30](https://ref.ly/John10:30); [17:6–8](https://ref.ly/John17:6-John17:8)). No prophet had ever been able to say, “Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father” ([John 14:9](https://ref.ly/John14:9)). Therefore, Jesus’s command that his disciples love each other “as I have loved you” ([John 13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34)) was new and shocking by any human standard. No one had ever loved perfectly as Jesus did ([John 13:1](https://ref.ly/John13:1)). Following his example of love was a new commandment. The greatness of Jesus’s love led him to “lay down his life for his friends” ([John 15:13](https://ref.ly/John15:13)). Similarly, John concluded that “we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers” ([1 John 3:16](https://ref.ly/1John3:16)). Love means never closing one's heart to a needy Christian ([1 John 3:17](https://ref.ly/1John3:17)). Instead, it means gladly sacrificing one's own good for another's benefit.
