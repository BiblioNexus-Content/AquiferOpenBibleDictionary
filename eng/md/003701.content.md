## Mary (id: 6961)

MARY
====

A popular name among Jewish women in the first century. The New Testament mentions six or seven different women named Mary.

1. Mary, the mother of Jesus. According to the stories of Jesus's birth in Matthew and Luke, Mary was a young Jewish virgin. She was likely from the tribe of Judah. While she was engaged to Joseph (of Davidic descent from the tribe of Judah) she was discovered to be pregnant. This is because she submitted to the Holy Spirit ([Matthew 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/Matt1:18-Matt1:25); [Luke 1:26–38](https://ref.ly/Luke1:26-Luke1:38)). The couple married and lived first in Nazareth of Galilee. Then they traveled to Bethlehem (Joseph’s hometown) for a census. Jesus was born in Bethlehem ([Matthew 2:1](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1); [Luke 1:5](https://ref.ly/Luke1:5); [2:4–5](https://ref.ly/Luke2:4-Luke2:5)). Matthew informs us that shortly after the birth the family had to go to Egypt to escape Herod ([Matthew 2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt2:13-Matt2:14)). Later, the family resided again in Nazareth ([Matthew 2:23](https://ref.ly/Matt2:23); [Luke 2:39](https://ref.ly/Luke2:39)).

    We have little other information about Mary. She was certainly a concerned mother. This was seen in her strong words to Jesus in [Luke 2:48](https://ref.ly/Luke2:48). She later had a high view of Jesus’s ability at the wedding in Cana ([John 2:1–4](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:4)). She had several other sons and daughters to care for. She appeared at the foot of the cross. Jesus asked “the beloved disciple” to care for her in her grief ([John 19:25–27](https://ref.ly/John19:25-John19:27)). After the resurrection she and Jesus’s brothers were among the disciples who received the the Spirit on Pentecost ([Acts 1:14](https://ref.ly/Acts1:14)). No further mention is made of her.

    Mary’s song of praise in [Luke 1:46–55](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46-Luke1:55) (called “The Magnificat”) shows her humility and trust in God’s will. She is truly “blessed among women” ([Luke 1:42](https://ref.ly/Luke1:42)).

2. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph. This woman goes by several names. In each account, she appears among Jesus’s faithful female disciples. She stood at the cross and witnessed the empty tomb. Matthew calls her “Mary the mother of James and Joseph” or just “the other Mary” ([Matthew 27:56, 61](https://ref.ly/Matt27:56,Matt27:61); [28:1](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1)). Mark uses a few names for her. First, he calls her “Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses.” Second, he calls her “Mary the mother of Joses.” Third, Mark calls her “Mary the mother of James” ([Mark 15:40, 47](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40,Mark15:47); [16:1](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1)). In John’s Gospel, she is “Mary wife of Clopas” ([John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). She may be a separate Mary. Tradition has it that this Mary was Jesus’s aunt. Clopas was Joseph’s brother (Eusebius’s *Ecclesiastical History* 3\.11\).
3. Mary Magdalene. We know little about this woman. Her name indicates that she was from Magdala in Galilee. Somewhere in Galilee, she met Jesus. He cast seven demons out of her. She then joined the band of disciples and followed Jesus wherever he went ([Luke 8:2](https://ref.ly/Luke8:2)). She followed him to Jerusalem at the foot of the cross when all the male disciples had fled ([Mark 15:40](https://ref.ly/Mark15:40); [John 19:25](https://ref.ly/John19:25)). She observed Jesus’s burial ([Mark 15:47](https://ref.ly/Mark15:47)). She witnessed the events surrounding the resurrection.

    [Matthew 28:1](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1), [Mark 16:1](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1), and [Luke 24:10](https://ref.ly/Luke24:10) group her with the other women who went to the tomb. John says that she was the first among these women to discover the empty tomb, the first to report to the disciples, and the first to see the risen Christ as she lingered by the tomb after all the others had left ([John 20:1–2, 11–18](https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:2,John20:11-John20:18)). This faithful disciple, however, was not allowed to touch her Lord ([John 20:17](https://ref.ly/John20:17)).

4. Mary of Bethany. This Judean Mary was the sister of Martha and Lazarus. We know three facts about her. First, she was such a devoted follower of Jesus that she neglected her household duties to listen to him ([Luke 10:38–42\).](https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42)  Jesus approved this. Second, she was apparently upset with Jesus when he did not come to heal her brother before he died ([John 11:20, 28–33](https://ref.ly/John11:20,John11:28-John11:33)). Finally, before Jesus died, she anointed him with an expensive ointment while he feasted at her home in Bethany ([Matthew 26:6–13](https://ref.ly/Matt26:6-Matt26:13); [Mark 14:3–9](https://ref.ly/Mark14:3-Mark14:9); [John 12:1–8](https://ref.ly/John12:1-John12:8)).
5. Mary, mother of John Mark. This woman appears only once in Scripture ([Acts 12:12](https://ref.ly/Acts12:12)). Her house was the meeting place of the church. Since it was apparently large and she had servants, she was a wealthy woman. She was probably a widow since no husband is mentioned. In her house, the church prayed for Peter, and Peter came there after being released from prison. Her son John Mark traveled with Paul and probably Peter as well.
6. Mary of Rome. In [Romans 16:6](https://ref.ly/Rom16:6) Paul greets a woman in Rome named simply “Mary, who has worked hard among you.” At some time she had been in Greece or Asia Minor, perhaps being forced out of Rome with Aquila and Priscilla ([Acts 18:2](https://ref.ly/Acts18:2); around AD 49\). While there she had met Paul. It is possible she became a Christian through him. She worked hard with him in his work of evangelism or caring for the church. A probable date for the book of Romans is AD 56\. By this date, she had returned to Rome. She was honored by the praise Paul heaped upon her and his others who worked with them living in Rome.
