## Lysimachus (id: 6806)

LYSIMACHUS
==========

1\. According to the Additions to Esther, the son of Ptolemy of Jerusalem and translator of the book of Esther into Greek.

2\. Menelaus appointed his brother Lysimachus to function as his deputy in the high priesthood. He himself had supplanted Jason as high priest. An evil man, Menelaus consented to acts of sacrilege by Lysimachus against the temple, including the theft of many gold vessels. The people reacted against Lysimachus, who then attempted to subdue them with 3,000 men. He failed. In the process the people, using stones and blocks of wood, routed Lysimachus and his men, killing Lysimachus near the treasury.
