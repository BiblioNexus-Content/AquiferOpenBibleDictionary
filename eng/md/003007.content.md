## Jeduthun (id: 6261)

JEDUTHUN
========

Member of the Levitical family of Merar who, along with Asaph and Heman, presided over the music in the sanctuary in David’s reign ([1 Chr 25:1](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1); [2 Chr 5:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr5:12); called “Ethan” in [1 Chr 6:44](https://ref.ly/1Chr6:44); [15:17](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:17)). Jeduthun is mentioned in the titles of [Psalms 39](https://ref.ly/Ps39:1-Ps39:13), [62](https://ref.ly/Ps62:1-Ps62:12), and [77](https://ref.ly/Ps77:1-Ps77:20). Some of his sons were set apart to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals ([1 Chr 25:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:3)), apparently following the example of their father, who was called “the king’s seer” ([2 Chr 35:15](https://ref.ly/2Chr35:15)). In [1 Chronicles 16:38](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:38) and [42](https://ref.ly/1Chr16:42), he is listed as Obed\-edom’s father.
