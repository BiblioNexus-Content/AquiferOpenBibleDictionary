## Nacon (id: 7276)

NACON
=====

The threshing floor of Nacon was a place King David passed through when he was bringing the ark of the covenant from Baale\-judah (also called Kiriath\-jearim) to Jerusalem. When they reached the threshing floor of Nacon, a man named Uzzah reached out and touched the ark to steady it, and God struck him dead ([2 Samuel 6:6](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:6)). 

Because of this incident, David renamed this place "Perez\-uzzah," which means "the breaking forth upon Uzzah" ([2 Samuel 6:8](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:8)). In another account of this same event, this place is called "Kidon" instead of "Nacon" ([1 Chronicles 13:9](https://ref.ly/1Chr13:9)).
