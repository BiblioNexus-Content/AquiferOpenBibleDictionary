JEHUDI
======

A son of Nethaniah and a messenger of King Jehoiakim of Judah. Some officials sent Jehudi to summon the prophet Baruch to read the scroll of Jeremiah in private to them. Later, Jehoiakim ordered Jehudi to read the same scroll in public in front of him and all the court. Then he burned the writing ([Jeremiah 36:14–23](https://ref.ly/Jer36:14-Jer36:23)).
